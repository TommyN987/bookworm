# Bookworm

## A JavaScript Application

[Live version](https://tommyn987.github.io/bookworm/dist/)

Bookworm is a simple, fully responsive application built with Vanilla JavaScript, utilizing webpack for module bundling and Bootstrap for layout and styling. I built it as my project for object oriented programming in JavaScript, and for practicing string and array manipulation. Five public domain books are entered as five giant strings. The user can load any of them by clicking on their titles. The app then formats the string and displays it in a readable form, it counts the most and least used words in the book and displays them with the respective counts. With the search functionality, the user can search for specific words in the book. The app will then count all the appearances of the searched word, and highlight them in the text.
