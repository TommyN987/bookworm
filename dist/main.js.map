has inclined to a plain tale\nwith few pretensions.\n\nTo the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an\nobscure aspirant.\n\nTo my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical\nsense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended\nAuthor.\n\nThe Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I\nmust thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are\ncertain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted\nand high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to\nthem, _i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say\ncordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.\n\nHaving thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved\nme, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,\ntherefore, to be overlooked. I mean the timorous or carping few who\ndoubt the tendency of such books as “Jane Eyre:” in whose eyes whatever\nis unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against\nbigotry—that parent of crime—an insult to piety, that regent of God on\nearth. I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I\nwould remind them of certain simple truths.\n\nConventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To\nattack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask from the\nface of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of\nThorns.\n\nThese things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct\nas is vice from virtue. Men too often confound them: they should not be\nconfounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human\ndoctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be\nsubstituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ. There is—I repeat\nit—a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly\nand clearly the line of separation between them.\n\nThe world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been\naccustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show\npass for sterling worth—to let white-washed walls vouch for clean\nshrines. It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose—to rase the\ngilding, and show base metal under it—to penetrate the sepulchre, and\nreveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.\n\nAhab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning\nhim, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaanah\nbetter; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped\nhis ears to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.\n\nThere is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle\ndelicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of\nsociety, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of\nJudah and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as\nprophet-like and as vital—a mien as dauntless and as daring. Is the\nsatirist of “Vanity Fair” admired in high places? I cannot tell; but I\nthink if some of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his\nsarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation,\nwere to take his warnings in time—they or their seed might yet escape a\nfatal Rimoth-Gilead.\n\nWhy have I alluded to this man? I have alluded to him, Reader, because\nI think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his\ncontemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first\nsocial regenerator of the day—as the very master of that working corps\nwho would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I\nthink no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that\nsuits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent. They say he\nis like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers. He\nresembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on\ncarrion, but Thackeray never does. His wit is bright, his humour\nattractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that\nthe mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the\nsummer-cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb. Finally,\nI have alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him—if he will accept the\ntribute of a total stranger—I have dedicated this second edition of\n“JANE EYRE.”\n\nCURRER BELL.\n\n_December_ 21_st_, 1847.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION\n\n\nI avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of “Jane Eyre”\naffords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that\nmy claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone. If,\ntherefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed\nto me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,\ndenied where it is justly due.\n\nThis explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have\nbeen made, and to prevent future errors.\n\nCURRER BELL.\n\n_April_ 13_th_, 1848.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nThere was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been\nwandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning;\nbut since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early)\nthe cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain\nso penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the\nquestion.\n\nI was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly\nafternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight,\nwith nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of\nBessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical\ninferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.\n\nThe said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama\nin the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and\nwith her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor\ncrying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the\ngroup; saying, “She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me\nat a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover\nby her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to\nacquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive\nand sprightly manner—something lighter, franker, more natural, as it\nwere—she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for\ncontented, happy, little children.”\n\n“What does Bessie say I have done?” I asked.\n\n“Jane, I don’t like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is\nsomething truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that\nmanner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain\nsilent.”\n\nA breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It\ncontained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care\nthat it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the\nwindow-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk;\nand, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in\ndouble retirement.\n\nFolds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left\nwere the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from\nthe drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of\nmy book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it\noffered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and\nstorm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a\nlong and lamentable blast.\n\nI returned to my book—Bewick’s History of British Birds: the\nletterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet\nthere were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not\npass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of\nsea-fowl; of “the solitary rocks and promontories” by them only\ninhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern\nextremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape—\n\n“Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,\nBoils round the naked, melancholy isles\nOf farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge\nPours in among the stormy Hebrides.”\n\n\nNor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of\nLapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with\n“the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary\nspace,—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the\naccumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above\nheights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of\nextreme cold.” Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own:\nshadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through\nchildren’s brains, but strangely impressive. The words in these\nintroductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes,\nand gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow\nand spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold\nand ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just\nsinking.\n\nI cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard,\nwith its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,\ngirdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the\nhour of eventide.\n\nThe two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine\nphantoms.\n\nThe fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind him, I passed over\nquickly: it was an object of terror.\n\nSo was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a\ndistant crowd surrounding a gallows.\n\nEach picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped\nunderstanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting:\nas interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter\nevenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having\nbrought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit\nabout it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed’s lace frills, and crimped her\nnightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and\nadventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a\nlater period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of\nMoreland.\n\nWith Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way. I\nfeared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The\nbreakfast-room door opened.\n\n“Boh! Madam Mope!” cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he\nfound the room apparently empty.\n\n“Where the dickens is she!” he continued. “Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to\nhis sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the\nrain—bad animal!”\n\n“It is well I drew the curtain,” thought I; and I wished fervently he\nmight not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it\nout himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza\njust put her head in at the door, and said at once—\n\n“She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.”\n\nAnd I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged\nforth by the said Jack.\n\n“What do you want?” I asked, with awkward diffidence.\n\n“Say, ‘What do you want, Master Reed?’” was the answer. “I want you to\ncome here;” and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a\ngesture that I was to approach and stand before him.\n\nJohn Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than\nI, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and\nunwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs\nand large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at table, which\nmade him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.\nHe ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home\nfor a month or two, “on account of his delicate health.” Mr. Miles, the\nmaster, affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and\nsweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother’s heart turned from an\nopinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that\nJohn’s sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining\nafter home.\n\nJohn had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an\nantipathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in\nthe week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I\nhad feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he\ncame near. There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he\ninspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces\nor his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young\nmaster by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf\non the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though\nhe did both now and then in her very presence, more frequently,\nhowever, behind her back.\n\nHabitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some\nthree minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could\nwithout damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while\ndreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him\nwho would presently deal it. I wonder if he read that notion in my\nface; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and\nstrongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a\nstep or two from his chair.\n\n“That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,” said he,\n“and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look\nyou had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!”\n\nAccustomed to John Reed’s abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;\nmy care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the\ninsult.\n\n“What were you doing behind the curtain?” he asked.\n\n“I was reading.”\n\n“Show the book.”\n\nI returned to the window and fetched it thence.\n\n“You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama\nsays; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg,\nand not to live here with gentlemen’s children like us, and eat the\nsame meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama’s expense. Now, I’ll\nteach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house\nbelongs to me, or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the door, out\nof the way of the mirror and the windows.”\n\nI did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him\nlift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively\nstarted aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume\nwas flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and\ncutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its\nclimax; other feelings succeeded.\n\n“Wicked and cruel boy!” I said. “You are like a murderer—you are like a\nslave-driver—you are like the Roman emperors!”\n\nI had read Goldsmith’s History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of\nNero, Caligula, &c. Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I\nnever thought thus to have declared aloud.\n\n“What! what!” he cried. “Did she say that to me? Did you hear her,\nEliza and Georgiana? Won’t I tell mama? but first—”\n\nHe ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had\nclosed with a desperate thing. I really saw in him a tyrant, a\nmurderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my\nneck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations\nfor the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic\nsort. I don’t very well know what I did with my hands, but he called me\n“Rat! Rat!” and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near him: Eliza and\nGeorgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came\nupon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted:\nI heard the words—\n\n“Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!”\n\n“Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!”\n\nThen Mrs. Reed subjoined—\n\n“Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.” Four hands were\nimmediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nI resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which\ngreatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were\ndisposed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself;\nor rather _out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious\nthat a moment’s mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange\npenalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my\ndesperation, to go all lengths.\n\n“Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she’s like a mad cat.”\n\n“For shame! for shame!” cried the lady’s-maid. “What shocking conduct,\nMiss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress’s son! Your\nyoung master.”\n\n“Master! How is he my master? Am I a servant?”\n\n“No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.\nThere, sit down, and think over your wickedness.”\n\nThey had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,\nand had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a\nspring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.\n\n“If you don’t sit still, you must be tied down,” said Bessie. “Miss\nAbbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.”\n\nMiss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature. This\npreparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a\nlittle of the excitement out of me.\n\n“Don’t take them off,” I cried; “I will not stir.”\n\nIn guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.\n\n“Mind you don’t,” said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was\nreally subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot\nstood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as\nincredulous of my sanity.\n\n“She never did so before,” at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.\n\n“But it was always in her,” was the reply. “I’ve told Missis often my\nopinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me. She’s an underhand\nlittle thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover.”\n\nBessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said—\n\n“You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs.\nReed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go\nto the poorhouse.”\n\nI had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very\nfirst recollections of existence included hints of the same kind. This\nreproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very\npainful and crushing, but only half intelligible. Miss Abbot joined in—\n\n“And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses\nReed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up\nwith them. They will have a great deal of money, and you will have\nnone: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself\nagreeable to them.”\n\n“What we tell you is for your good,” added Bessie, in no harsh voice,\n“you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would\nhave a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will\nsend you away, I am sure.”\n\n“Besides,” said Miss Abbot, “God will punish her: He might strike her\ndead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go? Come,\nBessie, we will leave her: I wouldn’t have her heart for anything. Say\nyour prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don’t\nrepent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and\nfetch you away.”\n\nThey went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.\n\nThe red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say\nnever, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead\nHall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it\ncontained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the\nmansion. A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with\ncurtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;\nthe two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half\nshrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;\nthe table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the\nwalls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,\nthe toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany. Out\nof these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the\npiled-up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy\nMarseilles counterpane. Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned\neasy-chair near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool\nbefore it; and looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.\n\nThis room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent,\nbecause remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was\nknown to be so seldom entered. The house-maid alone came here on\nSaturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week’s quiet\ndust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the\ncontents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored\ndivers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased\nhusband; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room—the\nspell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur.\n\nMr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed\nhis last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the\nundertaker’s men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration\nhad guarded it from frequent intrusion.\n\nMy seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,\nwas a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before\nme; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued,\nbroken reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the\nmuffled windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant\nmajesty of the bed and room. I was not quite sure whether they had\nlocked the door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see. Alas!\nyes: no jail was ever more secure. Returning, I had to cross before the\nlooking-glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it\nrevealed. All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in\nreality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white\nface and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving\nwhere all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it\nlike one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie’s evening\nstories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and\nappearing before the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my\nstool.\n\nSuperstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour\nfor complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted\nslave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a\nrapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal\npresent.\n\nAll John Reed’s violent tyrannies, all his sisters’ proud indifference,\nall his mother’s aversion, all the servants’ partiality, turned up in\nmy disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well. Why was I\nalways suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever\ncondemned? Why could I never please? Why was it useless to try to win\nany one’s favour? Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.\nGeorgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and\ninsolent carriage, was universally indulged. Her beauty, her pink\ncheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked at\nher, and to purchase indemnity for every fault. John no one thwarted,\nmuch less punished; though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed\nthe little pea-chicks, set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse\nvines of their fruit, and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the\nconservatory: he called his mother “old girl,” too; sometimes reviled\nher for her dark skin, similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her\nwishes; not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire; and he was\nstill “her own darling.” I dared commit no fault: I strove to fulfil\nevery duty; and I was termed naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking,\nfrom morning to noon, and from noon to night.\n\nMy head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no\none had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had\nturned against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded\nwith general opprobrium.\n\n“Unjust!—unjust!” said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into\nprecocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,\ninstigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable\noppression—as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never\neating or drinking more, and letting myself die.\n\nWhat a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon! How all my\nbrain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection! Yet in what\ndarkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I could\nnot answer the ceaseless inward question—_why_ I thus suffered; now, at\nthe distance of—I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.\n\nI was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had\nnothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen\nvassalage. If they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.\nThey were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not\nsympathise with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to\nthem in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a useless thing,\nincapable of serving their interest, or adding to their pleasure; a\nnoxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment,\nof contempt of their judgment. I know that had I been a sanguine,\nbrilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child—though equally\ndependent and friendless—Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence more\ncomplacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the\ncordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone\nto make me the scapegoat of the nursery.\n\nDaylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o’clock, and\nthe beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. I heard the rain\nstill beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind\nhowling in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a\nstone, and then my courage sank. My habitual mood of humiliation,\nself-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying\nire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had\nI been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? That certainly\nwas a crime: and was I fit to die? Or was the vault under the chancel\nof Gateshead Church an inviting bourne? In such vault I had been told\ndid Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I\ndwelt on it with gathering dread. I could not remember him; but I knew\nthat he was my own uncle—my mother’s brother—that he had taken me when\na parentless infant to his house; and that in his last moments he had\nrequired a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as\none of her own children. Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept\nthis promise; and so she had, I dare say, as well as her nature would\npermit her; but how could she really like an interloper not of her\nrace, and unconnected with her, after her husband’s death, by any tie?\nIt must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung\npledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could\nnot love, and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her\nown family group.\n\nA singular notion dawned upon me. I doubted not—never doubted—that if\nMr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I\nsat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls—occasionally also\nturning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaming mirror—I began to\nrecall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the\nviolation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the\nperjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed’s spirit,\nharassed by the wrongs of his sister’s child, might quit its\nabode—whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the\ndeparted—and rise before me in this chamber. I wiped my tears and\nhushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a\npreternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed\nface, bending over me with strange pity. This idea, consolatory in\ntheory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I\nendeavoured to stifle it—I endeavoured to be firm. Shaking my hair from\nmy eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;\nat this moment a light gleamed on the wall. Was it, I asked myself, a\nray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight\nwas still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling\nand quivered over my head. I can now conjecture readily that this\nstreak of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried\nby some one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for\nhorror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift\ndarting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world. My\nheart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I\ndeemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed,\nsuffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the\nlock in desperate effort. Steps came running along the outer passage;\nthe key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.\n\n“Miss Eyre, are you ill?” said Bessie.\n\n“What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!” exclaimed Abbot.\n\n“Take me out! Let me go into the nursery!” was my cry.\n\n“What for? Are you hurt? Have you seen something?” again demanded\nBessie.\n\n“Oh! I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come.” I had now got\nhold of Bessie’s hand, and she did not snatch it from me.\n\n“She has screamed out on purpose,” declared Abbot, in some disgust.\n“And what a scream! If she had been in great pain one would have\nexcused it, but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her\nnaughty tricks.”\n\n“What is all this?” demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed\ncame along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling\nstormily. “Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre\nshould be left in the red-room till I came to her myself.”\n\n“Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma’am,” pleaded Bessie.\n\n“Let her go,” was the only answer. “Loose Bessie’s hand, child: you\ncannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured. I abhor\nartifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that\ntricks will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it\nis only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall\nliberate you then.”\n\n“O aunt! have pity! Forgive me! I cannot endure it—let me be punished\nsome other way! I shall be killed if—”\n\n“Silence! This violence is all most repulsive:” and so, no doubt, she\nfelt it. I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked\non me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous\nduplicity.\n\nBessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now\nfrantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me\nin, without farther parley. I heard her sweeping away; and soon after\nshe was gone, I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed\nthe scene.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nThe next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had\na frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare,\ncrossed with thick black bars. I heard voices, too, speaking with a\nhollow sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,\nuncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my\nfaculties. Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;\nlifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more\ntenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before. I rested my head\nagainst a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.\n\nIn five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite\nwell that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery\nfire. It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the\nbed-foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near\nmy pillow, leaning over me.\n\nI felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and\nsecurity, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an\nindividual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.\nTurning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me\nthan that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the\nface of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,\nsometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for\nherself and the children she employed a physician.\n\n“Well, who am I?” he asked.\n\nI pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took\nit, smiling and saying, “We shall do very well by-and-by.” Then he laid\nme down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I\nwas not disturbed during the night. Having given some further\ndirections, and intimated that he should call again the next day, he\ndeparted; to my grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat\nin the chair near my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all\nthe room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness\nweighed it down.\n\n“Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?” asked Bessie, rather\nsoftly.\n\nScarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be\nrough. “I will try.”\n\n“Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?”\n\n“No, thank you, Bessie.”\n\n“Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o’clock; but you\nmay call me if you want anything in the night.”\n\nWonderful civility this! It emboldened me to ask a question.\n\n“Bessie, what is the matter with me? Am I ill?”\n\n“You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you’ll be\nbetter soon, no doubt.”\n\nBessie went into the housemaid’s apartment, which was near. I heard her\nsay—\n\n“Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren’t for my life be\nalone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it’s such a strange\nthing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything. Missis\nwas rather too hard.”\n\nSarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering\ntogether for half-an-hour before they fell asleep. I caught scraps of\ntheir conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer\nthe main subject discussed.\n\n“Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished”—“A great\nblack dog behind him”—“Three loud raps on the chamber door”—“A light in\nthe churchyard just over his grave,” &c., &c.\n\nAt last both slept: the fire and the candle went out. For me, the\nwatches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; ear, eye, and\nmind were alike strained by dread: such dread as children only can\nfeel.\n\nNo severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the\nred-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the\nreverberation to this day. Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful\npangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not\nwhat you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only\nuprooting my bad propensities.\n\nNext day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by\nthe nursery hearth. I felt physically weak and broken down: but my\nworse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness\nwhich kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt\ndrop from my cheek than another followed. Yet, I thought, I ought to\nhave been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone\nout in the carriage with their mama. Abbot, too, was sewing in another\nroom, and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys\nand arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of\nunwonted kindness. This state of things should have been to me a\nparadise of peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand\nand thankless fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such\na state that no calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them\nagreeably.\n\nBessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a\ntart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,\nnestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir\nin me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had\noften petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine\nit more closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a\nprivilege. This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was\ncordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it. Vain\nfavour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished\nfor, too late! I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,\nthe tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and\ntart away. Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted\nas a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver’s Travels\nfrom the library. This book I had again and again perused with delight.\nI considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of\ninterest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,\nhaving sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under\nmushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at\nlength made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of\nEngland to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,\nand the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being,\nin my creed, solid parts of the earth’s surface, I doubted not that I\nmight one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little\nfields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep,\nand birds of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty\nmastiffs, the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.\nYet, when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand—when I turned\nover its leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had,\ntill now, never failed to find—all was eerie and dreary; the giants\nwere gaunt goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a\nmost desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions. I closed\nthe book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table,\nbeside the untasted tart.\n\nBessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed\nher hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds\nof silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana’s doll.\nMeantime she sang: her song was—\n\n“In the days when we went gipsying,\n    A long time ago.”\n\n\nI had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for\nBessie had a sweet voice,—at least, I thought so. But now, though her\nvoice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.\nSometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low,\nvery lingeringly; “A long time ago” came out like the saddest cadence\nof a funeral hymn. She passed into another ballad, this time a really\ndoleful one.\n\n“My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;\n    Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;\nSoon will the twilight close moonless and dreary\n    Over the path of the poor orphan child.\n\nWhy did they send me so far and so lonely,\n    Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?\nMen are hard-hearted, and kind angels only\n    Watch o’er the steps of a poor orphan child.\n\nYet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,\n    Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,\nGod, in His mercy, protection is showing,\n    Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.\n\nEv’n should I fall o’er the broken bridge passing,\n    Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,\nStill will my Father, with promise and blessing,\n    Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.\n\nThere is a thought that for strength should avail me,\n    Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;\nHeaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;\n    God is a friend to the poor orphan child.”\n\n\n“Come, Miss Jane, don’t cry,” said Bessie as she finished. She might as\nwell have said to the fire, “don’t burn!” but how could she divine the\nmorbid suffering to which I was a prey? In the course of the morning\nMr. Lloyd came again.\n\n“What, already up!” said he, as he entered the nursery. “Well, nurse,\nhow is she?”\n\nBessie answered that I was doing very well.\n\n“Then she ought to look more cheerful. Come here, Miss Jane: your name\nis Jane, is it not?”\n\n“Yes, sir, Jane Eyre.”\n\n“Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what\nabout? Have you any pain?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Oh! I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis\nin the carriage,” interposed Bessie.\n\n“Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness.”\n\nI thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge,\nI answered promptly, “I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate\ngoing out in the carriage. I cry because I am miserable.”\n\n“Oh fie, Miss!” said Bessie.\n\nThe good apothecary appeared a little puzzled. I was standing before\nhim; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and\ngrey; not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now:\nhe had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face. Having considered\nme at leisure, he said—\n\n“What made you ill yesterday?”\n\n“She had a fall,” said Bessie, again putting in her word.\n\n“Fall! why, that is like a baby again! Can’t she manage to walk at her\nage? She must be eight or nine years old.”\n\n“I was knocked down,” was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by\nanother pang of mortified pride; “but that did not make me ill,” I\nadded; while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.\n\nAs he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang\nfor the servants’ dinner; he knew what it was. “That’s for you, nurse,”\nsaid he; “you can go down; I’ll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come\nback.”\n\nBessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because\npunctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.\n\n“The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?” pursued Mr. Lloyd when\nBessie was gone.\n\n“I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark.”\n\nI saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.\n\n“Ghost! What, you are a baby after all! You are afraid of ghosts?”\n\n“Of Mr. Reed’s ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out\nthere. Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if\nthey can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a\ncandle,—so cruel that I think I shall never forget it.”\n\n“Nonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable? Are you afraid now in\ndaylight?”\n\n“No: but night will come again before long: and besides,—I am\nunhappy,—very unhappy, for other things.”\n\n“What other things? Can you tell me some of them?”\n\nHow much I wished to reply fully to this question! How difficult it was\nto frame any answer! Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their\nfeelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they\nknow not how to express the result of the process in words. Fearful,\nhowever, of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my\ngrief by imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a\nmeagre, though, as far as it went, true response.\n\n“For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters.”\n\n“You have a kind aunt and cousins.”\n\nAgain I paused; then bunglingly enounced—\n\n“But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the\nred-room.”\n\nMr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.\n\n“Don’t you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?” asked he. “Are\nyou not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?”\n\n“It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here\nthan a servant.”\n\n“Pooh! you can’t be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid\nplace?”\n\n“If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can\nnever get away from Gateshead till I am a woman.”\n\n“Perhaps you may—who knows? Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?”\n\n“I think not, sir.”\n\n“None belonging to your father?”\n\n“I don’t know: I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might\nhave some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about\nthem.”\n\n“If you had such, would you like to go to them?”\n\nI reflected. Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to\nchildren: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable\npoverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,\nscanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty\nfor me was synonymous with degradation.\n\n“No; I should not like to belong to poor people,” was my reply.\n\n“Not even if they were kind to you?”\n\nI shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being\nkind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to\nbe uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes\nnursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of\nthe village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase\nliberty at the price of caste.\n\n“But are your relatives so very poor? Are they working people?”\n\n“I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly\nset: I should not like to go a begging.”\n\n“Would you like to go to school?”\n\nAgain I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes\nspoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore\nbackboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise:\nJohn Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed’s\ntastes were no rule for mine, and if Bessie’s accounts of\nschool-discipline (gathered from the young ladies of a family where she\nhad lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her\ndetails of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies\nwere, I thought, equally attractive. She boasted of beautiful paintings\nof landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing\nand pieces they could play, of purses they could net, of French books\nthey could translate; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I\nlistened. Besides, school would be a complete change: it implied a long\njourney, an entire separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new\nlife.\n\n“I should indeed like to go to school,” was the audible conclusion of\nmy musings.\n\n“Well, well! who knows what may happen?” said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.\n“The child ought to have change of air and scene,” he added, speaking\nto himself; “nerves not in a good state.”\n\nBessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling\nup the gravel-walk.\n\n“Is that your mistress, nurse?” asked Mr. Lloyd. “I should like to\nspeak to her before I go.”\n\nBessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way\nout. In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I\npresume, from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to\nrecommend my being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt\nreadily enough adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject\nwith Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was\nin bed, and, as they thought, asleep, “Missis was, she dared say, glad\nenough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always\nlooked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots\nunderhand.” Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being a sort of\ninfantine Guy Fawkes.\n\nOn that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot’s\ncommunications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman;\nthat my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who\nconsidered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so\nirritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that\nafter my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught\nthe typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing\ntown where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then\nprevalent: that my mother took the infection from him, and both died\nwithin a month of each other.\n\nBessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, “Poor Miss Jane\nis to be pitied, too, Abbot.”\n\n“Yes,” responded Abbot; “if she were a nice, pretty child, one might\ncompassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a\nlittle toad as that.”\n\n“Not a great deal, to be sure,” agreed Bessie: “at any rate, a beauty\nlike Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition.”\n\n“Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!” cried the fervent Abbot. “Little\ndarling!—with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour\nas she has; just as if she were painted!—Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh\nrabbit for supper.”\n\n“So could I—with a roast onion. Come, we’ll go down.” They went.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nFrom my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported\nconference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to\nsuffice as a motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,—I\ndesired and waited it in silence. It tarried, however: days and weeks\npassed: I had regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion\nwas made to the subject over which I brooded. Mrs. Reed surveyed me at\ntimes with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she\nhad drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her\nown children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself,\ncondemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the\nnursery, while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room. Not a\nhint, however, did she drop about sending me to school: still I felt an\ninstinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same\nroof with her; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me,\nexpressed an insuperable and rooted aversion.\n\nEliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me\nas little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he\nsaw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned\nagainst him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate\nrevolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to\ndesist, and ran from me uttering execrations, and vowing I had burst\nhis nose. I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a\nblow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either that or\nmy look daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to follow up my\nadvantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama. I heard him in\na blubbering tone commence the tale of how “that nasty Jane Eyre” had\nflown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather harshly—\n\n“Don’t talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she\nis not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your\nsisters should associate with her.”\n\nHere, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at\nall deliberating on my words—\n\n“They are not fit to associate with me.”\n\nMrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and\naudacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a\nwhirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my\ncrib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter\none syllable during the remainder of the day.\n\n“What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?” was my scarcely\nvoluntary demand. I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my\ntongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:\nsomething spoke out of me over which I had no control.\n\n“What?” said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey\neye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my\narm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child\nor fiend. I was now in for it.\n\n“My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so\ncan papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how\nyou wish me dead.”\n\nMrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she\nboxed both my ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie supplied\nthe hiatus by a homily of an hour’s length, in which she proved beyond\na doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared\nunder a roof. I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings\nsurging in my breast.\n\nNovember, December, and half of January passed away. Christmas and the\nNew Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;\npresents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given. From\nevery enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety\nconsisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana,\nand seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin\nfrocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and\nafterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played\nbelow, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the\njingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken\nhum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed. When\ntired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the\nsolitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not\nmiserable. To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,\nfor in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been\nkind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the\nevenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable\neye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen. But Bessie,\nas soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off\nto the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper’s room, generally\nbearing the candle along with her. I then sat with my doll on my knee\ntill the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that\nnothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers\nsank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings\nas I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.\nTo this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something,\nand, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to\nfind a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby\nas a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to remember with what\nabsurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive\nand capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded in my\nnight-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively\nhappy, believing it to be happy likewise.\n\nLong did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company,\nand listened for the sound of Bessie’s step on the stairs: sometimes\nshe would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors,\nor perhaps to bring me something by way of supper—a bun or a\ncheese-cake—then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I\nhad finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed\nme, and said, “Good night, Miss Jane.” When thus gentle, Bessie seemed\nto me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished\nmost intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and\nnever push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too\noften wont to do. Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good\nnatural capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a\nremarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the\nimpression made on me by her nursery tales. She was pretty too, if my\nrecollections of her face and person are correct. I remember her as a\nslim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and\ngood, clear complexion; but she had a capricious and hasty temper, and\nindifferent ideas of principle or justice: still, such as she was, I\npreferred her to any one else at Gateshead Hall.\n\nIt was the fifteenth of January, about nine o’clock in the morning:\nBessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned\nto their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to\ngo and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not\nless so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the\nmoney she thus obtained. She had a turn for traffic, and a marked\npropensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and\nchickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about\nflower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary having\norders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her\nparterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her\nhead if she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her money,\nshe first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old\ncurl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the\nhousemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued treasure,\nconsented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate of\ninterest—fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every\nquarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.\n\nGeorgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and\ninterweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of\nwhich she had found a store in a drawer in the attic. I was making my\nbed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged\nbefore she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of\nunder-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.). Having\nspread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat\nto put in order some picture-books and doll’s house furniture scattered\nthere; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone\n(for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her\nproperty) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other\noccupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the\nwindow was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through\nwhich I might look out on the grounds, where all was still and\npetrified under the influence of a hard frost.\n\nFrom this window were visible the porter’s lodge and the carriage-road,\nand just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling\nthe panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a\ncarriage roll through. I watched it ascending the drive with\nindifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought\nvisitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house,\nthe door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted. All this being\nnothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in\nthe spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the\ntwigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the\ncasement. The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the\ntable, and having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash\nto put out the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running\nupstairs into the nursery.\n\n“Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there? Have you\nwashed your hands and face this morning?” I gave another tug before I\nanswered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash\nyielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the\ncherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied—\n\n“No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.”\n\n“Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now? You look\nquite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you\nopening the window for?”\n\nI was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a\nhurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,\ninflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands\nwith soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a\nbristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the\ntop of the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the\nbreakfast-room.\n\nI would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed\nwas there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door\nupon me. I slowly descended. For nearly three months, I had never been\ncalled to Mrs. Reed’s presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the\nbreakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions,\non which it dismayed me to intrude.\n\nI now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door,\nand I stopped, intimidated and trembling. What a miserable little\npoltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those\ndays! I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to\nthe parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement\nringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.\n\n“Who could want me?” I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the\nstiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.\n“What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?—a man or a\nwoman?” The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and\ncurtseying low, I looked up at—a black pillar!—such, at least, appeared\nto me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing\nerect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask,\nplaced above the shaft by way of capital.\n\nMrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to\nme to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger\nwith the words: “This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to\nyou.”\n\n_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood,\nand having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which\ntwinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass\nvoice, “Her size is small: what is her age?”\n\n“Ten years.”\n\n“So much?” was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for\nsome minutes. Presently he addressed me—“Your name, little girl?”\n\n“Jane Eyre, sir.”\n\nIn uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;\nbut then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all\nthe lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.\n\n“Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?”\n\nImpossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a\ncontrary opinion: I was silent. Mrs. Reed answered for me by an\nexpressive shake of the head, adding soon, “Perhaps the less said on\nthat subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.”\n\n“Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;” and bending\nfrom the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair\nopposite Mrs. Reed’s. “Come here,” he said.\n\nI stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.\nWhat a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a\ngreat nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!\n\n“No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,” he began, “especially a\nnaughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?”\n\n“They go to hell,” was my ready and orthodox answer.\n\n“And what is hell? Can you tell me that?”\n\n“A pit full of fire.”\n\n“And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for\never?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“What must you do to avoid it?”\n\nI deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:\n“I must keep in good health, and not die.”\n\n“How can you keep in good health? Children younger than you die daily.\nI buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,—a\ngood little child, whose soul is now in heaven. It is to be feared the\nsame could not be said of you were you to be called hence.”\n\nNot being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down\non the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself\nfar enough away.\n\n“I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having\nbeen the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress.”\n\n“Benefactress! benefactress!” said I inwardly: “they all call Mrs. Reed\nmy benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing.”\n\n“Do you say your prayers night and morning?” continued my interrogator.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Do you read your Bible?”\n\n“Sometimes.”\n\n“With pleasure? Are you fond of it?”\n\n“I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel,\nand a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and\nJob and Jonah.”\n\n“And the Psalms? I hope you like them?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“No? oh, shocking! I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six\nPsalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a\ngingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: ‘Oh!\nthe verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;’ says he, ‘I wish to be a\nlittle angel here below;’ he then gets two nuts in recompense for his\ninfant piety.”\n\n“Psalms are not interesting,” I remarked.\n\n“That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to\nchange it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of\nstone and give you a heart of flesh.”\n\nI was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that\noperation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed\ninterposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the\nconversation herself.\n\n“Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to\nyou three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character\nand disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school,\nI should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to\nkeep a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst\nfault, a tendency to deceit. I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that\nyou may not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst.”\n\nWell might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her\nnature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however\ncarefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my\nefforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.\nNow, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I\ndimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new\nphase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I\ncould not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and\nunkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under Mr.\nBrocklehurst’s eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do\nto remedy the injury?\n\n“Nothing, indeed,” thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and\nhastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.\n\n“Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,” said Mr. Brocklehurst; “it\nis akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake\nburning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.\nReed. I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.”\n\n“I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,”\ncontinued my benefactress; “to be made useful, to be kept humble: as\nfor the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at\nLowood.”\n\n“Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,” returned Mr.\nBrocklehurst. “Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly\nappropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial\ncare shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them. I have studied\nhow best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only\nthe other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success. My second\ndaughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her\nreturn she exclaimed: ‘Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls\nat Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their\nlong pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their\nfrocks—they are almost like poor people’s children! and,’ said she,\n‘they looked at my dress and mama’s, as if they had never seen a silk\ngown before.’”\n\n“This is the state of things I quite approve,” returned Mrs. Reed; “had\nI sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more\nexactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre. Consistency, my dear Mr.\nBrocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things.”\n\n“Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been\nobserved in every arrangement connected with the establishment of\nLowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations,\nhardy and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and\nits inhabitants.”\n\n“Quite right, sir. I may then depend upon this child being received as\na pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her\nposition and prospects?”\n\n“Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,\nand I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable\nprivilege of her election.”\n\n“I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I\nassure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was\nbecoming too irksome.”\n\n“No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning. I shall\nreturn to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good\nfriend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner. I shall\nsend Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there\nwill be no difficulty about receiving her. Good-bye.”\n\n“Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,\nand to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst.”\n\n“I will, madam. Little girl, here is a book entitled the ‘Child’s\nGuide’; read it with prayer, especially that part containing ‘An\naccount of the awfully sudden death of Martha G——, a naughty child\naddicted to falsehood and deceit.’”\n\nWith these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn\nin a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.\n\nMrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she\nwas sewing, I was watching her. Mrs. Reed might be at that time some\nsix or seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame,\nsquare-shouldered and strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not\nobese: she had a somewhat large face, the under jaw being much\ndeveloped and very solid; her brow was low, her chin large and\nprominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under her light\neyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and opaque,\nher hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was sound as a bell—illness\nnever came near her; she was an exact, clever manager; her household\nand tenantry were thoroughly under her control; her children only at\ntimes defied her authority and laughed it to scorn; she dressed well,\nand had a presence and port calculated to set off handsome attire.\n\nSitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her\nfigure; I perused her features. In my hand I held the tract containing\nthe sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been\npointed as to an appropriate warning. What had just passed; what Mrs.\nReed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of\ntheir conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had\nfelt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of\nresentment fomented now within me.\n\nMrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers\nat the same time suspended their nimble movements.\n\n“Go out of the room; return to the nursery,” was her mandate. My look\nor something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with\nextreme though suppressed irritation. I got up, I went to the door; I\ncame back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up\nto her.\n\n_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but\nhow? What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist? I\ngathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence—\n\n“I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved _you;_ but I\ndeclare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the\nworld except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to\nyour girl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I.”\n\nMrs. Reed’s hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice\ncontinued to dwell freezingly on mine.\n\n“What more have you to say?” she asked, rather in the tone in which a\nperson might address an opponent of adult age than such as is\nordinarily used to a child.\n\nThat eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had. Shaking\nfrom head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued—\n\n“I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt\nagain as long as I live. I will never come to see you when I am grown\nup; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I\nwill say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me\nwith miserable cruelty.”\n\n“How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?”\n\n“How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the _truth_. You\nthink I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or\nkindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity. I shall remember\nhow you thrust me back—roughly and violently thrust me back—into the\nred-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in\nagony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, ‘Have\nmercy! Have mercy, Aunt Reed!’ And that punishment you made me suffer\nbecause your wicked boy struck me—knocked me down for nothing. I will\ntell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale. People think you a\ngood woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted. _You_ are deceitful!”\n\n\nHow dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth\n\nEre I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with\nthe strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It seemed as\nif an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into\nunhoped-for liberty. Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed\nlooked frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting\nup her hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as\nif she would cry.\n\n“Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you? Why do you\ntremble so violently? Would you like to drink some water?”\n\n“No, Mrs. Reed.”\n\n“Is there anything else you wish for, Jane? I assure you, I desire to\nbe your friend.”\n\n“Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful\ndisposition; and I’ll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and\nwhat you have done.”\n\n“Jane, you don’t understand these things: children must be corrected\nfor their faults.”\n\n“Deceit is not my fault!” I cried out in a savage, high voice.\n\n“But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to\nthe nursery—there’s a dear—and lie down a little.”\n\n“I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.\nReed, for I hate to live here.”\n\n“I will indeed send her to school soon,” murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto\nvoce_; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.\n\nI was left there alone—winner of the field. It was the hardest battle I\nhad fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the\nrug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror’s\nsolitude. First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce\npleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my\npulses. A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot\ngive its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine,\nwithout experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of\nreaction. A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would\nhave been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs.\nReed: the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead,\nwould have represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when\nhalf-an-hour’s silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my\nconduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating position.\n\nSomething of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic\nwine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour,\nmetallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.\nWillingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed’s pardon; but I\nknew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way\nto make her repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every\nturbulent impulse of my nature.\n\nI would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;\nfain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of\nsombre indignation. I took a book—some Arabian tales; I sat down and\nendeavoured to read. I could make no sense of the subject; my own\nthoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found\nfascinating. I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the\nshrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or\nbreeze, through the grounds. I covered my head and arms with the skirt\nof my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was\nquite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the\nfalling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept\nby past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together. I leaned against a\ngate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where\nthe short grass was nipped and blanched. It was a very grey day; a most\nopaque sky, “onding on snaw,” canopied all; thence flakes fell at\nintervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without\nmelting. I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over\nand over again, “What shall I do?—what shall I do?”\n\nAll at once I heard a clear voice call, “Miss Jane! where are you? Come\nto lunch!”\n\nIt was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step\ncame tripping down the path.\n\n“You naughty little thing!” she said. “Why don’t you come when you are\ncalled?”\n\nBessie’s presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been\nbrooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat\ncross. The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed,\nI was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid’s transitory anger;\nand I _was_ disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart. I just\nput my two arms round her and said, “Come, Bessie! don’t scold.”\n\nThe action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to\nindulge in: somehow it pleased her.\n\n“You are a strange child, Miss Jane,” she said, as she looked down at\nme; “a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I\nsuppose?”\n\nI nodded.\n\n“And won’t you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?”\n\n“What does Bessie care for me? She is always scolding me.”\n\n“Because you’re such a queer, frightened, shy little thing. You should\nbe bolder.”\n\n“What! to get more knocks?”\n\n“Nonsense! But you are rather put upon, that’s certain. My mother said,\nwhen she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one\nof her own to be in your place.—Now, come in, and I’ve some good news\nfor you.”\n\n“I don’t think you have, Bessie.”\n\n“Child! what do you mean? What sorrowful eyes you fix on me! Well, but\nMissis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this\nafternoon, and you shall have tea with me. I’ll ask cook to bake you a\nlittle cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for\nI am soon to pack your trunk. Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in\na day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with\nyou.”\n\n“Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.”\n\n“Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don’t be afraid\nof me. Don’t start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it’s so\nprovoking.”\n\n“I don’t think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I\nhave got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to\ndread.”\n\n“If you dread them they’ll dislike you.”\n\n“As you do, Bessie?”\n\n“I don’t dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all\nthe others.”\n\n“You don’t show it.”\n\n“You little sharp thing! you’ve got quite a new way of talking. What\nmakes you so venturesome and hardy?”\n\n“Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides”—I was going to say\nsomething about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second\nthoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.\n\n“And so you’re glad to leave me?”\n\n“Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I’m rather sorry.”\n\n“Just now! and rather! How coolly my little lady says it! I dare say\nnow if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn’t give it me: you’d say\nyou’d _rather_ not.”\n\n“I’ll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.” Bessie stooped; we\nmutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.\nThat afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie\ntold me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her\nsweetest songs. Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nFive o’clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,\nwhen Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and\nnearly dressed. I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had\nwashed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just\nsetting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib. I\nwas to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates\nat six A.M. Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in\nthe nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast. Few children\ncan eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.\nBessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled\nmilk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a\npaper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse\nand bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the\nnursery. As we passed Mrs. Reed’s bedroom, she said, “Will you go in\nand bid Missis good-bye?”\n\n“No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to\nsupper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins\neither; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best\nfriend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly.”\n\n“What did you say, Miss?”\n\n“Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to\nthe wall.”\n\n“That was wrong, Miss Jane.”\n\n“It was quite right, Bessie. Your Missis has not been my friend: she\nhas been my foe.”\n\n“O Miss Jane! don’t say so!”\n\n“Good-bye to Gateshead!” cried I, as we passed through the hall and\nwent out at the front door.\n\nThe moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose\nlight glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw. Raw\nand chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down\nthe drive. There was a light in the porter’s lodge: when we reached it,\nwe found the porter’s wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had\nbeen carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door. It\nwanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had\nstruck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went\nto the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.\n\n“Is she going by herself?” asked the porter’s wife.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And how far is it?”\n\n“Fifty miles.”\n\n“What a long way! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far\nalone.”\n\nThe coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and\nits top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged\nhaste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie’s neck, to\nwhich I clung with kisses.\n\n“Be sure and take good care of her,” cried she to the guard, as he\nlifted me into the inside.\n\n“Ay, ay!” was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed\n“All right,” and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie and\nGateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote\nand mysterious regions.\n\nI remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed\nto me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over\nhundreds of miles of road. We passed through several towns, and in one,\na very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the\npassengers alighted to dine. I was carried into an inn, where the guard\nwanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in\nan immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from\nthe ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled\nwith musical instruments. Here I walked about for a long time, feeling\nvery strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and\nkidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having\nfrequently figured in Bessie’s fireside chronicles. At last the guard\nreturned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector\nmounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over\nthe “stony street” of L——.\n\nThe afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I\nbegan to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we\nceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills\nheaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a\nvalley, dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the\nprospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.\n\nLulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered\nwhen the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,\nand a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and\ndress by the light of the lamps.\n\n“Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?” she asked. I answered\n“Yes,” and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach\ninstantly drove away.\n\nI was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion\nof the coach: gathering my faculties, I looked about me. Rain, wind,\nand darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall\nbefore me and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new\nguide: she shut and locked it behind her. There was now visible a house\nor houses—for the building spread far—with many windows, and lights\nburning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and\nwere admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into\na room with a fire, where she left me alone.\n\nI stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked\nround; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth\nshowed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany\nfurniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the\ndrawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough. I was puzzling to\nmake out the subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened,\nand an individual carrying a light entered; another followed close\nbehind.\n\nThe first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and\nlarge forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her\ncountenance was grave, her bearing erect.\n\n“The child is very young to be sent alone,” said she, putting her\ncandle down on the table. She considered me attentively for a minute or\ntwo, then further added—\n\n“She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?”\nshe asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.\n\n“A little, ma’am.”\n\n“And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to\nbed, Miss Miller. Is this the first time you have left your parents to\ncome to school, my little girl?”\n\nI explained to her that I had no parents. She inquired how long they\nhad been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could\nread, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with\nher forefinger, and saying, “She hoped I should be a good child,”\ndismissed me along with Miss Miller.\n\nThe lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with\nme appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice,\nlook, and air. Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion,\nthough of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one\nwho had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed,\nwhat I afterwards found she really was, an under-teacher. Led by her, I\npassed from compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a\nlarge and irregular building; till, emerging from the total and\nsomewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we had\ntraversed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a\nwide, long room, with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of\nwhich burnt a pair of candles, and seated all round on benches, a\ncongregation of girls of every age, from nine or ten to twenty. Seen by\nthe dim light of the dips, their number to me appeared countless,\nthough not in reality exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in\nbrown stuff frocks of quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores. It\nwas the hour of study; they were engaged in conning over their\nto-morrow’s task, and the hum I had heard was the combined result of\ntheir whispered repetitions.\n\nMiss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking\nup to the top of the long room she cried out—\n\n“Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!”\n\nFour tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered\nthe books and removed them. Miss Miller again gave the word of command—\n\n“Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!”\n\nThe tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray,\nwith portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a\npitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray. The portions were\nhanded round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug\nbeing common to all. When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was\nthirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering\nme incapable of eating: I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten\ncake shared into fragments.\n\nThe meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed\noff, two and two, upstairs. Overpowered by this time with weariness, I\nscarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that,\nlike the schoolroom, I saw it was very long. To-night I was to be Miss\nMiller’s bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced\nat the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two\noccupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst\nsilence and complete darkness I fell asleep.\n\nThe night passed rapidly: I was too tired even to dream; I only once\nawoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in\ntorrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my\nside. When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls\nwere up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or\ntwo burned in the room. I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and\nI dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a\nbasin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin\nto six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room. Again the bell\nrang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the\nstairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were\nread by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out—\n\n“Form classes!”\n\nA great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller\nrepeatedly exclaimed, “Silence!” and “Order!” When it subsided, I saw\nthem all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at\nthe four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like\na Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat. A pause of some\nseconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss\nMiller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.\n\nA distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each\nwalked to a table and took her seat; Miss Miller assumed the fourth\nvacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the\nsmallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was\ncalled, and placed at the bottom of it.\n\nBusiness now began: the day’s Collect was repeated, then certain texts\nof Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of\nchapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour. By the time that exercise\nwas terminated, day had fully dawned. The indefatigable bell now\nsounded for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched\ninto another room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of\ngetting something to eat! I was now nearly sick from inanition, having\ntaken so little the day before.\n\nThe refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables\nsmoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent\nforth an odour far from inviting. I saw a universal manifestation of\ndiscontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those\ndestined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls\nof the first class, rose the whispered words—\n\n“Disgusting! The porridge is burnt again!”\n\n“Silence!” ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the\nupper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of\nsomewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,\nwhile a more buxom lady presided at the other. I looked in vain for her\nI had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller\noccupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,\nforeign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards\nfound, took the corresponding seat at the other board. A long grace was\nsaid and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the\nteachers, and the meal began.\n\nRavenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my\nportion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger\nblunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge\nis almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over\nit. The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and\ntry to swallow it; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.\nBreakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks being returned for\nwhat we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was\nevacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and in\npassing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and\ntaste it; she looked at the others; all their countenances expressed\ndispleasure, and one of them, the stout one, whispered—\n\n“Abominable stuff! How shameful!”\n\nA quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which\nthe schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it\nseemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used\ntheir privilege. The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one\nand all abused roundly. Poor things! it was the sole consolation they\nhad. Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great\ngirls standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures. I\nheard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which\nMiss Miller shook her head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort\nto check the general wrath; doubtless she shared in it.\n\nA clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and\nstanding in the middle of the room, cried—\n\n“Silence! To your seats!”\n\nDiscipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved\ninto order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of\ntongues. The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but\nstill, all seemed to wait. Ranged on benches down the sides of the\nroom, the eighty girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage\nthey appeared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl\nvisible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker\nabout the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped something like\na Highlander’s purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to\nserve the purpose of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings\nand country-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles. Above twenty of\nthose clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or rather young\nwomen; it suited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even to the\nprettiest.\n\nI was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the\nteachers—none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a\nlittle coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh\nand grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple,\nweather-beaten, and over-worked—when, as my eye wandered from face to\nface, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common\nspring.\n\nWhat was the matter? I had heard no order given: I was puzzled. Ere I\nhad gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes\nwere now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and\nencountered the personage who had received me last night. She stood at\nthe bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at\neach end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely. Miss\nMiller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received\nher answer, went back to her place, and said aloud—\n\n“Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!”\n\nWhile the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly\nup the room. I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I\nretain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her\nsteps. Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely;\nbrown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling\nof long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on\neach of her temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in\nround curls, according to the fashion of those times, when neither\nsmooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the\nmode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish\ntrimming of black velvet; a gold watch (watches were not so common then\nas now) shone at her girdle. Let the reader add, to complete the\npicture, refined features; a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately\nair and carriage, and he will have, at least, as clearly as words can\ngive it, a correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple—Maria Temple, as\nI afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to\ncarry to church.\n\nThe superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her\nseat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the\nfirst class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the\nlower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,\ngrammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded,\nand music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.\nThe duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last\nstruck twelve. The superintendent rose—\n\n“I have a word to address to the pupils,” said she.\n\nThe tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it\nsank at her voice. She went on—\n\n“You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be\nhungry:—I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served\nto all.”\n\nThe teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.\n\n“It is to be done on my responsibility,” she added, in an explanatory\ntone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.\n\nThe bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the\nhigh delight and refreshment of the whole school. The order was now\ngiven “To the garden!” Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings\nof coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze. I was similarly\nequipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.\n\nThe garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to\nexclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one\nside, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of\nlittle beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to\ncultivate, and each bed had an owner. When full of flowers they would\ndoubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was\nwintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I stood and looked round\nme: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy,\nbut darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still\nsoaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The stronger among the girls\nran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones\nherded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst\nthese, as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard\nfrequently the sound of a hollow cough.\n\nAs yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of\nme; I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was\naccustomed; it did not oppress me much. I leant against a pillar of the\nverandah, drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the\ncold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed\nme within, delivered myself up to the employment of watching and\nthinking. My reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit\nrecord: I hardly yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life\nseemed floated away to an immeasurable distance; the present was vague\nand strange, and of the future I could form no conjecture. I looked\nround the convent-like garden, and then up at the house—a large\nbuilding, half of which seemed grey and old, the other half quite new.\nThe new part, containing the schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by\nmullioned and latticed windows, which gave it a church-like aspect; a\nstone tablet over the door bore this inscription:—\n\nLOWOOD INSTITUTION.\n\nThis portion was rebuilt A.D. ——, by Naomi Brocklehurst,\nof Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.\n\n“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works,\nand glorify your Father which is in heaven.”—St. Matt. v. 16.\n\n\nI read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation\nbelonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import. I was\nstill pondering the signification of “Institution,” and endeavouring to\nmake out a connection between the first words and the verse of\nScripture, when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my\nhead. I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a\nbook, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I\ncould see the title—it was “Rasselas;” a name that struck me as\nstrange, and consequently attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to\nlook up, and I said to her directly—\n\n“Is your book interesting?” I had already formed the intention of\nasking her to lend it to me some day.\n\n“I like it,” she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during\nwhich she examined me.\n\n“What is it about?” I continued. I hardly know where I found the\nhardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was\ncontrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a\nchord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a\nfrivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the\nserious or substantial.\n\n“You may look at it,” replied the girl, offering me the book.\n\nI did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less\ntaking than the title: “Rasselas” looked dull to my trifling taste; I\nsaw nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety\nseemed spread over the closely-printed pages. I returned it to her; she\nreceived it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to\nrelapse into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her—\n\n“Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?\nWhat is Lowood Institution?”\n\n“This house where you are come to live.”\n\n“And why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way different from\nother schools?”\n\n“It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are\ncharity-children. I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your\nfather or your mother dead?”\n\n“Both died before I can remember.”\n\n“Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and\nthis is called an institution for educating orphans.”\n\n“Do we pay no money? Do they keep us for nothing?”\n\n“We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each.”\n\n“Then why do they call us charity-children?”\n\n“Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the\ndeficiency is supplied by subscription.”\n\n“Who subscribes?”\n\n“Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood\nand in London.”\n\n“Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?”\n\n“The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,\nand whose son overlooks and directs everything here.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment.”\n\n“Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch,\nand who said we were to have some bread and cheese?”\n\n“To Miss Temple? Oh, no! I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.\nBrocklehurst for all she does. Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and\nall our clothes.”\n\n“Does he live here?”\n\n“No—two miles off, at a large hall.”\n\n“Is he a good man?”\n\n“He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good.”\n\n“Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And what are the other teachers called?”\n\n“The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,\nand cuts out—for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and\neverything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she\nteaches history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions;\nand the one who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to\nher side with a yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from\nLisle, in France, and teaches French.”\n\n“Do you like the teachers?”\n\n“Well enough.”\n\n“Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ——?—I cannot\npronounce her name as you do.”\n\n“Miss Scatcherd is hasty—you must take care not to offend her; Madame\nPierrot is not a bad sort of person.”\n\n“But Miss Temple is the best—isn’t she?”\n\n“Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest,\nbecause she knows far more than they do.”\n\n“Have you been long here?”\n\n“Two years.”\n\n“Are you an orphan?”\n\n“My mother is dead.”\n\n“Are you happy here?”\n\n“You ask rather too many questions. I have given you answers enough for\nthe present: now I want to read.”\n\nBut at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the\nhouse. The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more\nappetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the\ndinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong\nsteam redolent of rancid fat. I found the mess to consist of\nindifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked\ntogether. Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was\napportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within\nmyself whether every day’s fare would be like this.\n\nAfter dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons\nrecommenced, and were continued till five o’clock.\n\nThe only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with\nwhom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss\nScatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the\nlarge schoolroom. The punishment seemed to me in a high degree\nignominious, especially for so great a girl—she looked thirteen or\nupwards. I expected she would show signs of great distress and shame;\nbut to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though\ngrave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes. “How can she bear it so\nquietly—so firmly?” I asked of myself. “Were I in her place, it seems\nto me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up. She looks as\nif she were thinking of something beyond her punishment—beyond her\nsituation: of something not round her nor before her. I have heard of\nday-dreams—is she in a day-dream now? Her eyes are fixed on the floor,\nbut I am sure they do not see it—her sight seems turned in, gone down\ninto her heart: she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not\nat what is really present. I wonder what sort of a girl she is—whether\ngood or naughty.”\n\nSoon after five P.M. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of\ncoffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread. I devoured my bread and drank\nmy coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more—I\nwas still hungry. Half-an-hour’s recreation succeeded, then study; then\nthe glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Such\nwas my first day at Lowood.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nThe next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;\nbut this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of\nwashing; the water in the pitchers was frozen. A change had taken place\nin the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,\nwhistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long,\nhad made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to\nice.\n\nBefore the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over,\nI felt ready to perish with cold. Breakfast-time came at last, and this\nmorning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the\nquantity small. How small my portion seemed! I wished it had been\ndoubled.\n\nIn the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class,\nand regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had\nonly been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become\nan actor therein. At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart,\nthe lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change\nfrom task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three\no’clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of\nmuslin two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me\nto sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the\nsame. At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one\nclass still stood round Miss Scatcherd’s chair reading, and as all was\nquiet, the subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the\nmanner in which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or\ncommendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance. It was English\nhistory: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah:\nat the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the\nclass, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to\nstops, she was suddenly sent to the very bottom. Even in that obscure\nposition, Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant\nnotice: she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the\nfollowing:—\n\n“Burns” (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by\ntheir surnames, as boys are elsewhere), “Burns, you are standing on the\nside of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately.” “Burns, you poke\nyour chin most unpleasantly; draw it in.” “Burns, I insist on your\nholding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,”\n&c. &c.\n\nA chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the\ngirls examined. The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles\nI., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and\nship-money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every\nlittle difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her\nmemory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and\nshe was ready with answers on every point. I kept expecting that Miss\nScatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead of that, she\nsuddenly cried out—\n\n“You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this\nmorning!”\n\nBurns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.\n\n“Why,” thought I, “does she not explain that she could neither clean\nher nails nor wash her face, as the water was frozen?”\n\nMy attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a\nskein of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time\nto time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I\ncould mark, stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not\npursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd’s movements. When I returned\nto my seat, that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not\ncatch the import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into\nthe small inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a\nminute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one\nend. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a\nrespectful curtesy; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed\nher pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her\nneck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to Burns’\neye; and, while I paused from my sewing, because my fingers quivered at\nthis spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger, not a\nfeature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression.\n\n“Hardened girl!” exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; “nothing can correct you of\nyour slatternly habits: carry the rod away.”\n\nBurns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the\nbook-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her\npocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.\n\nThe play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the\nday at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at\nfive o’clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the\nlong restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer\nthan in the morning—its fires being allowed to burn a little more\nbrightly, to supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet\nintroduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of\nmany voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.\n\nOn the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her\npupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and\nlaughing groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I\npassed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it\nsnowed fast, a drift was already forming against the lower panes;\nputting my ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the\ngleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside.\n\nProbably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would\nhave been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the\nseparation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure\nchaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a\nstrange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to\nhowl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to\nrise to clamour.\n\nJumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of\nthe fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found\nBurns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the\ncompanionship of a book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.\n\n“Is it still ‘Rasselas’?” I asked, coming behind her.\n\n“Yes,” she said, “and I have just finished it.”\n\nAnd in five minutes more she shut it up. I was glad of this.\n\n“Now,” thought I, “I can perhaps get her to talk.” I sat down by her on\nthe floor.\n\n“What is your name besides Burns?”\n\n“Helen.”\n\n“Do you come a long way from here?”\n\n“I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland.”\n\n“Will you ever go back?”\n\n“I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.”\n\n“You must wish to leave Lowood?”\n\n“No! why should I? I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it\nwould be of no use going away until I have attained that object.”\n\n“But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?”\n\n“Cruel? Not at all! She is severe: she dislikes my faults.”\n\n“And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.\nIf she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should\nbreak it under her nose.”\n\n“Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.\nBrocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great\ngrief to your relations. It is far better to endure patiently a smart\nwhich nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose\nevil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides,\nthe Bible bids us return good for evil.”\n\n“But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand\nin the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl:\nI am far younger than you, and I could not bear it.”\n\n“Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is\nweak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be\nrequired to bear.”\n\nI heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of\nendurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the\nforbearance she expressed for her chastiser. Still I felt that Helen\nBurns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes. I suspected\nshe might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter\ndeeply; like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.\n\n“You say you have faults, Helen: what are they? To me you seem very\ngood.”\n\n“Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss\nScatcherd said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things in\norder; I am careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my\nlessons; I have no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot\n_bear_ to be subjected to systematic arrangements. This is all very\nprovoking to Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and\nparticular.”\n\n“And cross and cruel,” I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my\naddition: she kept silence.\n\n“Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?”\n\nAt the utterance of Miss Temple’s name, a soft smile flitted over her\ngrave face.\n\n“Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,\neven the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them\ngently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed\nliberally. One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that\neven her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to\ncure me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most\nhighly, cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight.”\n\n“That is curious,” said I, “it is so easy to be careful.”\n\n“For _you_ I have no doubt it is. I observed you in your class this\nmorning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed\nto wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.\nNow, mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss\nScatcherd, and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the\nvery sound of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream. Sometimes I think\nI am in Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the\nbubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden, near our\nhouse;—then, when it comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened;\nand having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the\nvisionary brook, I have no answer ready.”\n\n“Yet how well you replied this afternoon.”\n\n“It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had\ninterested me. This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was\nwondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and\nunwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity\nit was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no\nfarther than the prerogatives of the crown. If he had but been able to\nlook to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age\nwas tending! Still, I like Charles—I respect him—I pity him, poor\nmurdered king! Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they\nhad no right to shed. How dared they kill him!”\n\nHelen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very\nwell understand her—that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject\nshe discussed. I recalled her to my level.\n\n“And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?”\n\n“No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something\nto say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is\nsingularly agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is\noften just what I wished to gain.”\n\n“Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?”\n\n“Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination\nguides me. There is no merit in such goodness.”\n\n“A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I\never desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who\nare cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own\nway: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but\nwould grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we\nshould strike back again very hard; I am sure we should—so hard as to\nteach the person who struck us never to do it again.”\n\n“You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are\nbut a little untaught girl.”\n\n“But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to\nplease them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me\nunjustly. It is as natural as that I should love those who show me\naffection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved.”\n\n“Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and\ncivilised nations disown it.”\n\n“How? I don’t understand.”\n\n“It is not violence that best overcomes hate—nor vengeance that most\ncertainly heals injury.”\n\n“What then?”\n\n“Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts;\nmake His word your rule, and His conduct your example.”\n\n“What does He say?”\n\n“Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that\nhate you and despitefully use you.”\n\n“Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her\nson John, which is impossible.”\n\nIn her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith\nto pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.\nBitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve\nor softening.\n\nHelen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a\nremark, but she said nothing.\n\n“Well,” I asked impatiently, “is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad\nwoman?”\n\n“She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes\nyour cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely\nyou remember all she has done and said to you! What a singularly deep\nimpression her injustice seems to have made on your heart! No ill-usage\nso brands its record on my feelings. Would you not be happier if you\ntried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it\nexcited? Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity\nor registering wrongs. We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with\nfaults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we\nshall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when\ndebasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh,\nand only the spark of the spirit will remain,—the impalpable principle\nof light and thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the\ncreature: whence it came it will return; perhaps again to be\ncommunicated to some being higher than man—perhaps to pass through\ngradations of glory, from the pale human soul to brighten to the\nseraph! Surely it will never, on the contrary, be suffered to\ndegenerate from man to fiend? No; I cannot believe that: I hold another\ncreed: which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention; but in\nwhich I delight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it\nmakes Eternity a rest—a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss.\nBesides, with this creed, I can so clearly distinguish between the\ncriminal and his crime; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I\nabhor the last: with this creed revenge never worries my heart,\ndegradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me\ntoo low: I live in calm, looking to the end.”\n\nHelen’s head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this\nsentence. I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but\nrather to converse with her own thoughts. She was not allowed much time\nfor meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,\nexclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent—\n\n“Helen Burns, if you don’t go and put your drawer in order, and fold up\nyour work this minute, I’ll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at\nit!”\n\nHelen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor\nwithout reply as without delay.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nMy first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age\neither; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in\nhabituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks. The fear of failure\nin these points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my\nlot; though these were no trifles.\n\nDuring January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after\ntheir melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring\nbeyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these\nlimits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air. Our clothing\nwas insufficient to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots,\nthe snow got into our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became\nnumbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well\nthe distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening,\nwhen my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw,\nand stiff toes into my shoes in the morning. Then the scanty supply of\nfood was distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we\nhad scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid. From this\ndeficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on\nthe younger pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an\nopportunity, they would coax or menace the little ones out of their\nportion. Many a time I have shared between two claimants the precious\nmorsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing\nto a third half the contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the\nremainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the\nexigency of hunger.\n\nSundays were dreary days in that wintry season. We had to walk two\nmiles to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated. We set out\ncold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became\nalmost paralysed. It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance\nof cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in\nour ordinary meals, was served round between the services.\n\nAt the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and\nhilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy\nsummits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.\n\nI can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our\ndrooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered,\ngathered close about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example,\nto keep up our spirits, and march forward, as she said, “like stalwart\nsoldiers.” The other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves\ntoo much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.\n\nHow we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got\nback! But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in\nthe schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great\ngirls, and behind them the younger children crouched in groups,\nwrapping their starved arms in their pinafores.\n\nA little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of\nbread—a whole, instead of a half, slice—with the delicious addition of\na thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all\nlooked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath. I generally contrived to\nreserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder\nI was invariably obliged to part with.\n\nThe Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church\nCatechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew;\nand in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose\nirrepressible yawns attested her weariness. A frequent interlude of\nthese performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some\nhalf-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall\ndown, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be\ntaken up half dead. The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the\ncentre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the\nsermon was finished. Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank\ntogether in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors’ high\nstools.\n\nI have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed\nthat gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month\nafter my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the\narchdeacon: his absence was a relief to me. I need not say that I had\nmy own reasons for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.\n\nOne afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting\nwith a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,\nraised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just\npassing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and\nwhen, two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en\nmasse_, it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain\nwhose entrance they thus greeted. A long stride measured the\nschoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen,\nstood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from\nthe hearthrug of Gateshead. I now glanced sideways at this piece of\narchitecture. Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in\na surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.\n\nI had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I\nremembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my\ndisposition, &c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise\nMiss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature. All along I had been\ndreading the fulfilment of this promise,—I had been looking out daily\nfor the “Coming Man,” whose information respecting my past life and\nconversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.\n\nHe stood at Miss Temple’s side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did\nnot doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her\neye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb\nturn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt. I listened too; and as\nI happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of\nwhat he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.\n\n“I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it\nstruck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises,\nand I sorted the needles to match. You may tell Miss Smith that I\nforgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have\nsome papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give\nout more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are\napt to be careless and lose them. And, O ma’am! I wish the woollen\nstockings were better looked to!—when I was here last, I went into the\nkitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a\nquantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of\nthe holes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to\ntime.”\n\nHe paused.\n\n“Your directions shall be attended to, sir,” said Miss Temple.\n\n“And, ma’am,” he continued, “the laundress tells me some of the girls\nhave two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit\nthem to one.”\n\n“I think I can explain that circumstance, sir. Agnes and Catherine\nJohnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last\nThursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the\noccasion.”\n\nMr. Brocklehurst nodded.\n\n“Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance\noccur too often. And there is another thing which surprised me; I find,\nin settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of\nbread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the\npast fortnight. How is this? I looked over the regulations, and I find\nno such meal as lunch mentioned. Who introduced this innovation? and by\nwhat authority?”\n\n“I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,” replied Miss Temple:\n“the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly\neat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time.”\n\n“Madam, allow me an instant. You are aware that my plan in bringing up\nthese girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and\nindulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying. Should any\nlittle accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the\nspoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the\nincident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more\ndelicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the\naim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the spiritual\nedification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude\nunder the temporary privation. A brief address on those occasions would\nnot be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the\nopportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians;\nto the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord\nHimself, calling upon His disciples to take up their cross and follow\nHim; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread alone, but by\nevery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His divine\nconsolations, ‘If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy are\nye.’ Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt\nporridge, into these children’s mouths, you may indeed feed their vile\nbodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!”\n\nMr. Brocklehurst again paused—perhaps overcome by his feelings. Miss\nTemple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now\ngazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,\nappeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;\nespecially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor’s\nchisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified\nseverity.\n\nMeantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands\nbehind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly his\neye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or\nshocked its pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had\nhitherto used—\n\n“Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what—_what_ is that girl with curled hair?\nRed hair, ma’am, curled—curled all over?” And extending his cane he\npointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.\n\n“It is Julia Severn,” replied Miss Temple, very quietly.\n\n“Julia Severn, ma’am! And why has she, or any other, curled hair? Why,\nin defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she\nconform to the world so openly—here in an evangelical, charitable\nestablishment—as to wear her hair one mass of curls?”\n\n“Julia’s hair curls naturally,” returned Miss Temple, still more\nquietly.\n\n“Naturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these\ngirls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance? I have again\nand again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely,\nmodestly, plainly. Miss Temple, that girl’s hair must be cut off\nentirely; I will send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far\ntoo much of the excrescence—that tall girl, tell her to turn round.\nTell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall.”\n\nMiss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away\nthe involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however,\nand when the first class could take in what was required of them, they\nobeyed. Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and\ngrimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.\nBrocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,\nwhatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the\ninside was further beyond his interference than he imagined.\n\nHe scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes,\nthen pronounced sentence. These words fell like the knell of doom—\n\n“All those top-knots must be cut off.”\n\nMiss Temple seemed to remonstrate.\n\n“Madam,” he pursued, “I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of\nthis world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the\nflesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and\nsobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the\nyoung persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which\nvanity itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think\nof the time wasted, of—”\n\nMr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies,\nnow entered the room. They ought to have come a little sooner to have\nheard his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet,\nsilk, and furs. The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and\nseventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich\nplumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a\nprofusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was\nenveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a\nfalse front of French curls.\n\nThese ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and\nthe Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of\nthe room. It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend\nrelative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room\nupstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned\nthe laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now proceeded to\naddress divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with\nthe care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had\nno time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and\nenchanted my attention.\n\nHitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss\nTemple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my\npersonal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only\nelude observation. To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and\nwhile seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a\nmanner as to conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my\ntreacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling\nwith an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it\nwas all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of\nslate, I rallied my forces for the worst. It came.\n\n“A careless girl!” said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after—“It is\nthe new pupil, I perceive.” And before I could draw breath, “I must not\nforget I have a word to say respecting her.” Then aloud: how loud it\nseemed to me! “Let the child who broke her slate come forward!”\n\nOf my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two\ngreat girls who sat on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me\ntowards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his\nvery feet, and I caught her whispered counsel—\n\n“Don’t be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be\npunished.”\n\nThe kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.\n\n“Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite,” thought I;\nand an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in\nmy pulses at the conviction. I was no Helen Burns.\n\n“Fetch that stool,” said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one\nfrom which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.\n\n“Place the child upon it.”\n\nAnd I was placed there, by whom I don’t know: I was in no condition to\nnote particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the\nheight of Mr. Brocklehurst’s nose, that he was within a yard of me, and\nthat a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of\nsilvery plumage extended and waved below me.\n\nMr. Brocklehurst hemmed.\n\n“Ladies,” said he, turning to his family, “Miss Temple, teachers, and\nchildren, you all see this girl?”\n\nOf course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses\nagainst my scorched skin.\n\n“You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form\nof childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given\nto all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.\nWho would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent\nin her? Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case.”\n\nA pause—in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel\nthat the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be\nshirked, must be firmly sustained.\n\n“My dear children,” pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,\n“this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn\nyou, that this girl, who might be one of God’s own lambs, is a little\ncastaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper\nand an alien. You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her\nexample; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,\nand shut her out from your converse. Teachers, you must watch her: keep\nyour eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her\nactions, punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation\nbe possible, for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this\nchild, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen\nwho says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut—this girl\nis—a liar!”\n\nNow came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in\nperfect possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts\nproduce their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics,\nwhile the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger\nones whispered, “How shocking!”\n\nMr. Brocklehurst resumed.\n\n“This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable\nlady who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own\ndaughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid\nby an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent\npatroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful\nlest her vicious example should contaminate their purity: she has sent\nher here to be healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to\nthe troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of\nyou not to allow the waters to stagnate round her.”\n\nWith this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button\nof his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to\nMiss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the\nroom. Turning at the door, my judge said—\n\n“Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak\nto her during the remainder of the day.”\n\nThere was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the\nshame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now\nexposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy. What my sensations\nwere, no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my\nbreath and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in\npassing, she lifted her eyes. What a strange light inspired them! What\nan extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me! How the new\nfeeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave\nor victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I mastered the rising\nhysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool. Helen\nBurns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was\nchidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and\nsmiled at me as she again went by. What a smile! I remember it now, and\nI know that it was the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it\nlit up her marked lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like\na reflection from the aspect of an angel. Yet at that moment Helen\nBurns wore on her arm “the untidy badge;” scarcely an hour ago I had\nheard her condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on\nthe morrow because she had blotted an exercise in copying it out. Such\nis the imperfect nature of man! such spots are there on the disc of the\nclearest planet; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd’s can only see those\nminute defects, and are blind to the full brightness of the orb.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nEre the half-hour ended, five o’clock struck; school was dismissed, and\nall were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to descend: it\nwas deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor. The\nspell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction\ntook place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I\nsank prostrate with my face to the ground. Now I wept: Helen Burns was\nnot here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and\nmy tears watered the boards. I had meant to be so good, and to do so\nmuch at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win\naffection. Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had\nreached the head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss\nTemple had smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing,\nand to let me learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement\ntwo months longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils;\ntreated as an equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any;\nnow, here I lay again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise\nmore?\n\n“Never,” I thought; and ardently I wished to die. While sobbing out\nthis wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up—again\nHelen Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the\nlong, vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.\n\n“Come, eat something,” she said; but I put both away from me, feeling\nas if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.\nHelen regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my\nagitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud. She sat down\non the ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her\nhead upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian. I\nwas the first who spoke—\n\n“Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a\nliar?”\n\n“Everybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you\ncalled so, and the world contains hundreds of millions.”\n\n“But what have I to do with millions? The eighty, I know, despise me.”\n\n“Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises\nor dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much.”\n\n“How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?”\n\n“Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:\nhe is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked. Had\nhe treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,\ndeclared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would\noffer you sympathy if they dared. Teachers and pupils may look coldly\non you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their\nhearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere\nlong appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.\nBesides, Jane”—she paused.\n\n“Well, Helen?” said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers\ngently to warm them, and went on—\n\n“If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own\nconscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be\nwithout friends.”\n\n“No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if\nothers don’t love me I would rather die than live—I cannot bear to be\nsolitary and hated, Helen. Look here; to gain some real affection from\nyou, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly\nsubmit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or\nto stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest—”\n\n“Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are\ntoo impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your\nframe, and put life into it, has provided you with other resources than\nyour feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you. Besides this earth,\nand besides the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom\nof spirits: that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those\nspirits watch us, for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were\ndying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred\ncrushed us, angels see our tortures, recognise our innocence (if\ninnocent we be: as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst\nhas weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I\nread a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and\nGod waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a\nfull reward. Why, then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress,\nwhen life is so soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to\nhappiness—to glory?”\n\nI was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted\nthere was an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the impression of\nwoe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having\ndone speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I\nmomentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.\n\nResting my head on Helen’s shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she\ndrew me to her, and we reposed in silence. We had not sat long thus,\nwhen another person came in. Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a\nrising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in\nthrough a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching\nfigure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.\n\n“I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,” said she; “I want you in my\nroom; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.”\n\nWe went; following the superintendent’s guidance, we had to thread some\nintricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her\napartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful. Miss Temple\ntold Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the\nhearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.\n\n“Is it all over?” she asked, looking down at my face. “Have you cried\nyour grief away?”\n\n“I am afraid I never shall do that.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma’am, and everybody\nelse, will now think me wicked.”\n\n“We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child. Continue\nto act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us.”\n\n“Shall I, Miss Temple?”\n\n“You will,” said she, passing her arm round me. “And now tell me who is\nthe lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?”\n\n“Mrs. Reed, my uncle’s wife. My uncle is dead, and he left me to her\ncare.”\n\n“Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?”\n\n“No, ma’am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have\noften heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that\nshe would always keep me.”\n\n“Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a\ncriminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.\nYou have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as\nyou can. Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and\nexaggerate nothing.”\n\nI resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most\nmoderate—most correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to\narrange coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my\nsad childhood. Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than\nit generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of\nHelen’s warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into\nthe narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary. Thus\nrestrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went\non that Miss Temple fully believed me.\n\nIn the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to\nsee me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode\nof the red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some\ndegree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection\nthe spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my\nwild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark\nand haunted chamber.\n\nI had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she\nthen said—\n\n“I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply\nagrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every\nimputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now.”\n\nShe kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well\ncontented to stand, for I derived a child’s pleasure from the\ncontemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her\nwhite forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark\neyes), she proceeded to address Helen Burns.\n\n“How are you to-night, Helen? Have you coughed much to-day?”\n\n“Not quite so much, I think, ma’am.”\n\n“And the pain in your chest?”\n\n“It is a little better.”\n\nMiss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she\nreturned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low. She\nwas pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully—\n\n“But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such.” She\nrang her bell.\n\n“Barbara,” she said to the servant who answered it, “I have not yet had\ntea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.”\n\nAnd a tray was soon brought. How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups\nand bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!\nHow fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!\nof which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)\ndiscerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.\n\n“Barbara,” said she, “can you not bring a little more bread and butter?\nThere is not enough for three.”\n\nBarbara went out: she returned soon—\n\n“Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.”\n\nMrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.\nBrocklehurst’s own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.\n\n“Oh, very well!” returned Miss Temple; “we must make it do, Barbara, I\nsuppose.” And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, “Fortunately, I\nhave it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once.”\n\nHaving invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before\neach of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast,\nshe got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in\npaper, disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.\n\n“I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,” said she,\n“but as there is so little toast, you must have it now,” and she\nproceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.\n\nWe feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least\ndelight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which\nour hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the\ndelicate fare she liberally supplied.\n\nTea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we\nsat one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between\nher and Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.\n\nMiss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in\nher mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded\ndeviation into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which\nchastened the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her,\nby a controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to\nHelen Burns, I was struck with wonder.\n\nThe refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of\nher beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something\nin her own unique mind, had roused her powers within her. They woke,\nthey kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which\ntill this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone\nin the liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty\nmore singular than that of Miss Temple’s—a beauty neither of fine\ncolour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of\nmovement, of radiance. Then her soul sat on her lips, and language\nflowed, from what source I cannot tell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart\nlarge enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure,\nfull, fervid eloquence? Such was the characteristic of Helen’s\ndiscourse on that, to me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed\nhastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during\na protracted existence.\n\nThey conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times\npast; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed\nat: they spoke of books: how many they had read! What stores of\nknowledge they possessed! Then they seemed so familiar with French\nnames and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss\nTemple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the\nLatin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade\nher read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of\nveneration expanding at every sounding line. She had scarcely finished\nere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple\nembraced us both, saying, as she drew us to her heart—\n\n“God bless you, my children!”\n\nHelen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more\nreluctantly; it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her\nshe a second time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from\nher cheek.\n\nOn reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was\nexamining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns’s, and when we\nentered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that\nto-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles\npinned to her shoulder.\n\n“My things were indeed in shameful disorder,” murmured Helen to me, in\na low voice: “I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.”\n\nNext morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece\nof pasteboard the word “Slattern,” and bound it like a phylactery round\nHelen’s large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead. She wore\nit till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved\npunishment. The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school,\nI ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of\nwhich she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears,\nhot and large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the\nspectacle of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the\nheart.\n\nAbout a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,\nwho had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that\nwhat he said went to corroborate my account. Miss Temple, having\nassembled the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into\nthe charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to\nbe able to pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation. The\nteachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of\npleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.\n\nThus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,\nresolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and\nmy success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally\ntenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few\nweeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was\nallowed to commence French and drawing. I learned the first two tenses\nof the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls,\nby-the-bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa),\non the same day. That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in\nimagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread\nand new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I\nfeasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the\ndark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,\npicturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet\npaintings of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking\nat ripe cherries, of wren’s nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed\nabout with young ivy sprays. I examined, too, in thought, the\npossibility of my ever being able to translate currently a certain\nlittle French story which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was\nthat problem solved to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.\n\nWell has Solomon said—“Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than\na stalled ox and hatred therewith.”\n\nI would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for\nGateshead and its daily luxuries.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nBut the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened. Spring\ndrew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;\nits snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated. My wretched feet,\nflayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to\nheal and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and\nmornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood\nin our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:\nsometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a\ngreenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily,\nsuggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each\nmorning brighter traces of her steps. Flowers peeped out amongst the\nleaves; snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed\npansies. On Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and\nfound still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.\n\nI discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the\nhorizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls\nof our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits\ngirdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright\nbeck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies. How different had this\nscene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter,\nstiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!—when mists as chill as death\nwandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and\nrolled down “ing” and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the\nbeck! That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore\nasunder the wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often\nthickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its\nbanks, _that_ showed only ranks of skeletons.\n\nApril advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,\nplacid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its\nduration. And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose\nits tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and\noak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up\nprofusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its\nhollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its\nwild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed\nspots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this I enjoyed often\nand fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty\nand pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to\nadvert.\n\nHave I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it\nas bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?\nAssuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another\nquestion.\n\nThat forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred\npestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into\nthe Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and\ndormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an\nhospital.\n\nSemi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils\nto receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one\ntime. Classes were broken up, rules relaxed. The few who continued well\nwere allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant\ninsisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:\nand had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain\nthem. Miss Temple’s whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she\nlived in the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours’\nrest at night. The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and\nmaking other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls\nwho were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and\nwilling to remove them from the seat of contagion. Many, already\nsmitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were\nburied quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay.\n\nWhile disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its\nfrequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls;\nwhile its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and\nthe pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality,\nthat bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful\nwoodland out of doors. Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks\nhad sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were\nin bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and\ncrimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening,\ntheir scent of spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all\nuseless for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and\nthen a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.\n\nBut I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of\nthe scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies,\nfrom morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we\nlived better too. Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near\nLowood now: household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross\nhousekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her\nsuccessor, who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the\nways of her new abode, provided with comparative liberality. Besides,\nthere were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our\nbreakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare\na regular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large piece\nof cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we carried\naway with us to the wood, where we each chose the spot we liked best,\nand dined sumptuously.\n\nMy favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry\nfrom the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading\nthrough the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot. The stone was just\nbroad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that\ntime my chosen comrade—one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant\npersonage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly because she was\nwitty and original, and partly because she had a manner which set me at\nmy ease. Some years older than I, she knew more of the world, and could\ntell me many things I liked to hear: with her my curiosity found\ngratification: to my faults also she gave ample indulgence, never\nimposing curb or rein on anything I said. She had a turn for narrative,\nI for analysis; she liked to inform, I to question; so we got on\nswimmingly together, deriving much entertainment, if not much\nimprovement, from our mutual intercourse.\n\nAnd where, meantime, was Helen Burns? Why did I not spend these sweet\ndays of liberty with her? Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as\nto have grown tired of her pure society? Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I\nhave mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only\ntell me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I\nchose to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was\nqualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a\ntaste of far higher things.\n\nTrue, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective\nbeing, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of\nHelen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of\nattachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated\nmy heart. How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under\nall circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship,\nwhich ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled? But Helen\nwas ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight\nto I knew not what room upstairs. She was not, I was told, in the\nhospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for her\ncomplaint was consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my\nignorance, understood something mild, which time and care would be sure\nto alleviate.\n\nI was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming\ndownstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss\nTemple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to\ngo and speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and\nthen not distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance\nunder the verandah.\n\nOne evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with\nMary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the\nothers, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to\nask it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked\nafter a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood. When\nwe got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the\nsurgeon’s, was standing at the garden door. Mary Ann remarked that she\nsupposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at\nthat time of the evening. She went into the house; I stayed behind a\nfew minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in\nthe forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the\nmorning. This done, I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt\nso sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so\nwarm; the still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the\nmorrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east. I was noting\nthese things and enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my\nmind as it had never done before:—\n\n“How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!\nThis world is pleasant—it would be dreary to be called from it, and to\nhave to go who knows where?”\n\nAnd then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had\nbeen infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time\nit recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each\nside, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the\none point where it stood—the present; all the rest was formless cloud\nand vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and\nplunging amid that chaos. While pondering this new idea, I heard the\nfront door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse. After\nshe had seen him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the\ndoor, but I ran up to her.\n\n“How is Helen Burns?”\n\n“Very poorly,” was the answer.\n\n“Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And what does he say about her?”\n\n“He says she’ll not be here long.”\n\nThis phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed\nthe notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her\nown home. I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but\nI knew instantly now! It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen\nBurns was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going\nto be taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were. I\nexperienced a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a\ndesire—a necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.\n\n“She is in Miss Temple’s room,” said the nurse.\n\n“May I go up and speak to her?”\n\n“Oh no, child! It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;\nyou’ll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.”\n\nThe nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which\nled to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o’clock, and\nMiss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.\n\nIt might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I—not having\nbeen able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the\ndormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose—rose\nsoftly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept\nfrom the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple’s room. It was\nquite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light\nof the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage\nwindows, enabled me to find it without difficulty. An odour of camphor\nand burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I\npassed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night\nshould hear me. I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_\nsee Helen,—I must embrace her before she died,—I must give her one last\nkiss, exchange with her one last word.\n\nHaving descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below,\nand succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I\nreached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just\nopposite to me was Miss Temple’s room. A light shone through the\nkeyhole and from under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the\nvicinity. Coming near, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to\nadmit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness. Indisposed to\nhesitate, and full of impatient impulses—soul and senses quivering with\nkeen throes—I put it back and looked in. My eye sought Helen, and\nfeared to find death.\n\nClose by Miss Temple’s bed, and half covered with its white curtains,\nthere stood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under the\nclothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken\nto in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt\ndimly on the table. Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards\nthat she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room. I\nadvanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but\nI preferred speaking before I withdrew it. I still recoiled at the\ndread of seeing a corpse.\n\n“Helen!” I whispered softly, “are you awake?”\n\nShe stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,\nwasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear\nwas instantly dissipated.\n\n“Can it be you, Jane?” she asked, in her own gentle voice.\n\n“Oh!” I thought, “she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could\nnot speak and look so calmly if she were.”\n\nI got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her\ncheek both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she\nsmiled as of old.\n\n“Why are you come here, Jane? It is past eleven o’clock: I heard it\nstrike some minutes since.”\n\n“I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not\nsleep till I had spoken to you.”\n\n“You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably.”\n\n“Are you going somewhere, Helen? Are you going home?”\n\n“Yes; to my long home—my last home.”\n\n“No, no, Helen!” I stopped, distressed. While I tried to devour my\ntears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the\nnurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she\nwhispered—\n\n“Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my\nquilt.”\n\nI did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her. After a\nlong silence, she resumed, still whispering—\n\n“I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be\nsure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about. We all must die\none day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is\ngentle and gradual: my mind is at rest. I leave no one to regret me\nmuch: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss\nme. By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings. I had not\nqualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should\nhave been continually at fault.”\n\n“But where are you going to, Helen? Can you see? Do you know?”\n\n“I believe; I have faith: I am going to God.”\n\n“Where is God? What is God?”\n\n“My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created. I rely\nimplicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count\nthe hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,\nreveal Him to me.”\n\n“You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and\nthat our souls can get to it when we die?”\n\n“I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign\nmy immortal part to Him without any misgiving. God is my father; God is\nmy friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me.”\n\n“And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?”\n\n“You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same\nmighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.”\n\nAgain I questioned, but this time only in thought. “Where is that\nregion? Does it exist?” And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she\nseemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I\nlay with my face hidden on her neck. Presently she said, in the\nsweetest tone—\n\n“How comfortable I am! That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;\nI feel as if I could sleep: but don’t leave me, Jane; I like to have\nyou near me.”\n\n“I’ll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away.”\n\n“Are you warm, darling?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Good-night, Jane.”\n\n“Good-night, Helen.”\n\nShe kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.\n\nWhen I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I\nwas in somebody’s arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through\nthe passage back to the dormitory. I was not reprimanded for leaving my\nbed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was\nafforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I\nlearned that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had\nfound me laid in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns’s\nshoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep, and Helen was—dead.\n\nHer grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her\ndeath it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble\ntablet marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word\n“Resurgam.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nHitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant\nexistence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as\nmany chapters. But this is not to be a regular autobiography: I am only\nbound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some\ndegree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost\nin silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of\nconnection.\n\nWhen the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at\nLowood, it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its\nvirulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention on\nthe school. Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge, and by\ndegrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a\nhigh degree. The unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality\nof the children’s food; the brackish, fetid water used in its\npreparation; the pupils’ wretched clothing and accommodations—all these\nthings were discovered, and the discovery produced a result mortifying\nto Mr. Brocklehurst, but beneficial to the institution.\n\nSeveral wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed\nlargely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better\nsituation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing\nintroduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of\na committee. Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family\nconnections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of\ntreasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen\nof rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of\ninspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with\nstrictness, comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness. The\nschool, thus improved, became in time a truly useful and noble\ninstitution. I remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration,\nfor eight years: six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both\ncapacities I bear my testimony to its value and importance.\n\nDuring these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because\nit was not inactive. I had the means of an excellent education placed\nwithin my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to\nexcel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers,\nespecially such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the\nadvantages offered me. In time I rose to be the first girl of the first\nclass; then I was invested with the office of teacher; which I\ndischarged with zeal for two years: but at the end of that time I\naltered.\n\nMiss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent\nof the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my\nacquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;\nshe had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,\ncompanion. At this period she married, removed with her husband (a\nclergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant\ncounty, and consequently was lost to me.\n\nFrom the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every\nsettled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree\na home to me. I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much\nof her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated\nfeelings had become the inmates of my mind. I had given in allegiance\nto duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes\nof others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued\ncharacter.\n\nBut destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and\nMiss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,\nshortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the\nhill and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room,\nand there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday\ngranted in honour of the occasion.\n\nI walked about the chamber most of the time. I imagined myself only to\nbe regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my\nreflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the\nafternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned\non me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming\nprocess; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or\nrather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been\nbreathing in her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural\nelement, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions. It did not\nseem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone:\nit was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason\nfor tranquillity was no more. My world had for some years been in\nLowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I\nremembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of\nhopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had\ncourage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life\namidst its perils.\n\nI went to my window, opened it, and looked out. There were the two\nwings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of\nLowood; there was the hilly horizon. My eye passed all other objects to\nrest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to\nsurmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed\nprison-ground, exile limits. I traced the white road winding round the\nbase of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I\nlonged to follow it farther! I recalled the time when I had travelled\nthat very road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill at\ntwilight; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me\nfirst to Lowood, and I had never quitted it since. My vacations had all\nbeen spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead;\nneither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me. I had had\nno communication by letter or message with the outer world:\nschool-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and voices, and\nfaces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and antipathies—such\nwas what I knew of existence. And now I felt that it was not enough; I\ntired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon. I desired\nliberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it\nseemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing. I abandoned it and\nframed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus: that petition,\ntoo, seemed swept off into vague space: “Then,” I cried, half\ndesperate, “grant me at least a new servitude!”\n\nHere a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.\n\nI was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till\nbedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me\nfrom the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of\nsmall talk. How I wished sleep would silence her. It seemed as if,\ncould I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I\nstood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my\nrelief.\n\nMiss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her\nhabitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light\nthan as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with\nsatisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced\nthought instantly revived.\n\n“A new servitude! There is something in that,” I soliloquised\n(mentally, be it understood; I did not talk aloud), “I know there is,\nbecause it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as\nLiberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more\nthan sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of\ntime to listen to them. But Servitude! That must be matter of fact. Any\none may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to\nserve elsewhere. Can I not get so much of my own will? Is not the thing\nfeasible? Yes—yes—the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain\nactive enough to ferret out the means of attaining it.”\n\nI sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly\nnight; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to\nthink_ again with all my might.\n\n“What do I want? A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under\nnew circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything\nbetter. How do people do to get a new place? They apply to friends, I\nsuppose: I have no friends. There are many others who have no friends,\nwho must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what\nis their resource?”\n\nI could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find\na response, and quickly. It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses\nthrob in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in\nchaos; and no result came of its efforts. Feverish with vain labour, I\ngot up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or\ntwo, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.\n\nA kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion\non my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my\nmind:—“Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the\n_——shire Herald_.”\n\n“How? I know nothing about advertising.”\n\nReplies rose smooth and prompt now:—\n\n“You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a\ncover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the\nfirst opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be\naddressed to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in\nabout a week after you send your letter, if any are come, and act\naccordingly.”\n\nThis scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind;\nI had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.\n\nWith earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,\nand directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:—\n\n“A young lady accustomed to tuition” (had I not been a teacher two\nyears?) “is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family\nwhere the children are under fourteen” (I thought that as I was barely\neighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my\nown age). “She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good\nEnglish education, together with French, Drawing, and Music” (in those\ndays, reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have\nbeen held tolerably comprehensive). “Address, J.E., Post-office,\nLowton, ——shire.”\n\nThis document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked\nleave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform\nsome small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;\npermission was readily granted; I went. It was a walk of two miles, and\nthe evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or\ntwo, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through\nheavy rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.\n\nThe succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however,\nlike all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a\npleasant autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton. A\npicturesque track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck\nand through the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought\nmore of the letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the\nlittle burgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.\n\nMy ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of\nshoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I\nstepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker’s\nto the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn\nspectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands.\n\n“Are there any letters for J.E.?” I asked.\n\nShe peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and\nfumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began\nto falter. At last, having held a document before her glasses for\nnearly five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying\nthe act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance—it was for J.E.\n\n“Is there only one?” I demanded.\n\n“There are no more,” said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my\nface homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by\neight, and it was already half-past seven.\n\nVarious duties awaited me on my arrival: I had to sit with the girls\nduring their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see\nthem to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers. Even when we\nfinally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my\ncompanion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I\ndreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,\nhowever, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect:\nshe was already snoring before I had finished undressing. There still\nremained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an\ninitial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.\n\n“If J.E., who advertised in the _——shire Herald_ of last Thursday,\npossesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to\ngive satisfactory references as to character and competency, a\nsituation can be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little\ngirl, under ten years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per\nannum. J.E. is requested to send references, name, address, and all\nparticulars to the direction:—\n\n“Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ——shire.”\n\nI examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather\nuncertain, like that of an elderly lady. This circumstance was\nsatisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for\nmyself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some\nscrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to\nbe respectable, proper, _en règle_. I now felt that an elderly lady was\nno bad ingredient in the business I had on hand. Mrs. Fairfax! I saw\nher in a black gown and widow’s cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil:\na model of elderly English respectability. Thornfield! that, doubtless,\nwas the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I\nfailed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.\nMillcote, ——shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England;\nyes, I saw it; both the shire and the town. ——shire was seventy miles\nnearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a\nrecommendation to me. I longed to go where there was life and movement:\nMillcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A——: a busy\nplace enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete\nchange at least. Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of\nlong chimneys and clouds of smoke—“but,” I argued, “Thornfield will,\nprobably, be a good way from the town.”\n\nHere the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.\n\nNext day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be\nconfined to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their\nsuccess. Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent\nduring the noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting\na new situation where the salary would be double what I now received\n(for at Lowood I only got £15 per annum); and requested she would break\nthe matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and\nascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.\nShe obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter. The next\nday she laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs.\nReed must be written to, as she was my natural guardian. A note was\naccordingly addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that “I\nmight do as I pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my\naffairs.” This note went the round of the committee, and at last, after\nwhat appeared to me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to\nbetter my condition if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had\nalways conducted myself well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a\ntestimonial of character and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that\ninstitution, should forthwith be furnished me.\n\nThis testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a\ncopy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady’s reply, stating that she\nwas satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my\nassuming the post of governess in her house.\n\nI now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly. I\nhad not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and\nthe last day sufficed to pack my trunk,—the same I had brought with me\neight years ago from Gateshead.\n\nThe box was corded, the card nailed on. In half-an-hour the carrier was\nto call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at\nan early hour the next morning to meet the coach. I had brushed my\nblack stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff;\nsought in all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and\nnow having nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest. I could\nnot; though I had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an\ninstant; I was too much excited. A phase of my life was closing\nto-night, a new one opening to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the\ninterval; I must watch feverishly while the change was being\naccomplished.\n\n“Miss,” said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering\nlike a troubled spirit, “a person below wishes to see you.”\n\n“The carrier, no doubt,” I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.\nI was passing the back-parlour or teachers’ sitting-room, the door of\nwhich was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out—\n\n“It’s her, I am sure!—I could have told her anywhere!” cried the\nindividual who stopped my progress and took my hand.\n\nI looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,\nyet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and\nlively complexion.\n\n“Well, who is it?” she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half\nrecognised; “you’ve not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?”\n\nIn another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: “Bessie!\nBessie! Bessie!” that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half\ncried, and we both went into the parlour. By the fire stood a little\nfellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.\n\n“That is my little boy,” said Bessie directly.\n\n“Then you are married, Bessie?”\n\n“Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I’ve\na little girl besides Bobby there, that I’ve christened Jane.”\n\n“And you don’t live at Gateshead?”\n\n“I live at the lodge: the old porter has left.”\n\n“Well, and how do they all get on? Tell me everything about them,\nBessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will\nyou?” but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.\n\n“You’re not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout,”\ncontinued Mrs. Leaven. “I dare say they’ve not kept you too well at\nschool: Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and\nMiss Georgiana would make two of you in breadth.”\n\n“Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?”\n\n“Very. She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there\neverybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his\nrelations were against the match; and—what do you think?—he and Miss\nGeorgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.\nIt was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and\nnow she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are\nalways quarrelling—”\n\n“Well, and what of John Reed?”\n\n“Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish. He went to\ncollege, and he got—plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles\nwanted him to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a\ndissipated young man, they will never make much of him, I think.”\n\n“What does he look like?”\n\n“He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he\nhas such thick lips.”\n\n“And Mrs. Reed?”\n\n“Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she’s not\nquite easy in her mind: Mr. John’s conduct does not please her—he\nspends a deal of money.”\n\n“Did she send you here, Bessie?”\n\n“No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that\nthere had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another\npart of the country, I thought I’d just set off, and get a look at you\nbefore you were quite out of my reach.”\n\n“I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.” I said this laughing:\nI perceived that Bessie’s glance, though it expressed regard, did in no\nshape denote admiration.\n\n“No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a\nlady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty\nas a child.”\n\nI smiled at Bessie’s frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I\nconfess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most\npeople wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an\nexterior likely to second that desire brings anything but\ngratification.\n\n“I dare say you are clever, though,” continued Bessie, by way of\nsolace. “What can you do? Can you play on the piano?”\n\n“A little.”\n\nThere was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me\nto sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was\ncharmed.\n\n“The Miss Reeds could not play as well!” said she exultingly. “I always\nsaid you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?”\n\n“That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.” It was a\nlandscape in water colours, of which I had made a present to the\nsuperintendent, in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the\ncommittee on my behalf, and which she had framed and glazed.\n\n“Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane! It is as fine a picture as any\nMiss Reed’s drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies\nthemselves, who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?”\n\n“Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.”\n\n“And you can work on muslin and canvas?”\n\n“I can.”\n\n“Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would be: you will get\non whether your relations notice you or not. There was something I\nwanted to ask you. Have you ever heard anything from your father’s\nkinsfolk, the Eyres?”\n\n“Never in my life.”\n\n“Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:\nand they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the\nReeds are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to\nGateshead and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty\nmiles off; he seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he\nwas going on a voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail\nfrom London in a day or two. He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe\nhe was your father’s brother.”\n\n“What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?”\n\n“An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine—the butler did\ntell me—”\n\n“Madeira?” I suggested.\n\n“Yes, that is it—that is the very word.”\n\n“So he went?”\n\n“Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high\nwith him; she called him afterwards a ‘sneaking tradesman.’ My Robert\nbelieves he was a wine-merchant.”\n\n“Very likely,” I returned; “or perhaps clerk or agent to a\nwine-merchant.”\n\nBessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was\nobliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning\nat Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach. We parted finally at the\ndoor of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she\nset off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to\ntake her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me\nto new duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nA new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and\nwhen I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a\nroom in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on\nthe walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such\nornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of\nGeorge the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a\nrepresentation of the death of Wolfe. All this is visible to you by the\nlight of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an\nexcellent fire, near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and\numbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill\ncontracted by sixteen hours’ exposure to the rawness of an October day:\nI left Lowton at four o’clock A.M., and the Millcote town clock is now\njust striking eight.\n\nReader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil\nin my mind. I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some\none to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden\nsteps the “boots” placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name\npronounced, and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey\nme to Thornfield. Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a\nwaiter if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered\nin the negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a\nprivate room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and\nfears are troubling my thoughts.\n\nIt is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself\nquite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain\nwhether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by\nmany impediments from returning to that it has quitted. The charm of\nadventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then\nthe throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when\nhalf-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone. I bethought myself to ring\nthe bell.\n\n“Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?” I asked of\nthe waiter who answered the summons.\n\n“Thornfield? I don’t know, ma’am; I’ll inquire at the bar.” He\nvanished, but reappeared instantly—\n\n“Is your name Eyre, Miss?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Person here waiting for you.”\n\nI jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the\ninn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit\nstreet I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.\n\n“This will be your luggage, I suppose?” said the man rather abruptly\nwhen he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.\n\n“Yes.” He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and\nthen I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to\nThornfield.\n\n“A matter of six miles.”\n\n“How long shall we be before we get there?”\n\n“Happen an hour and a half.”\n\nHe fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set\noff. Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I\nwas content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I\nleaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I\nmeditated much at my ease.\n\n“I suppose,” thought I, “judging from the plainness of the servant and\ncarriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the\nbetter; I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very\nmiserable with them. I wonder if she lives alone except this little\ngirl; if so, and if she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be\nable to get on with her; I will do my best; it is a pity that doing\none’s best does not always answer. At Lowood, indeed, I took that\nresolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I\nremember my best was always spurned with scorn. I pray God Mrs. Fairfax\nmay not turn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to\nstay with her! let the worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.\nHow far are we on our road now, I wonder?”\n\nI let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging\nby the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable\nmagnitude, much larger than Lowton. We were now, as far as I could see,\non a sort of common; but there were houses scattered all over the\ndistrict; I felt we were in a different region to Lowood, more\npopulous, less picturesque; more stirring, less romantic.\n\nThe roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk\nall the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two\nhours; at last he turned in his seat and said—\n\n“You’re noan so far fro’ Thornfield now.”\n\nAgain I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower\nagainst the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow\ngalaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet. About\nten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we\npassed through, and they clashed to behind us. We now slowly ascended a\ndrive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed\nfrom one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark. The car stopped\nat the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went\nin.\n\n“Will you walk this way, ma’am?” said the girl; and I followed her\nacross a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a\nroom whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me,\ncontrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for\ntwo hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable\npicture presented itself to my view.\n\nA snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair\nhigh-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable\nlittle elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin\napron; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately\nand milder looking. She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat\ndemurely at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the\nbeau-ideal of domestic comfort. A more reassuring introduction for a\nnew governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to\noverwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old\nlady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.\n\n“How do you do, my dear? I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John\ndrives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.”\n\n“Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?” said I.\n\n“Yes, you are right: do sit down.”\n\nShe conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl\nand untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so\nmuch trouble.\n\n“Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with\ncold. Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are\nthe keys of the storeroom.”\n\nAnd she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and\ndelivered them to the servant.\n\n“Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,” she continued. “You’ve brought\nyour luggage with you, haven’t you, my dear?”\n\n“Yes, ma’am.”\n\n“I’ll see it carried into your room,” she said, and bustled out.\n\n“She treats me like a visitor,” thought I. “I little expected such a\nreception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like\nwhat I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult\ntoo soon.”\n\nShe returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a\nbook or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now\nbrought, and then herself handed me the refreshments. I felt rather\nconfused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before\nreceived, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she\ndid not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her\nplace, I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.\n\n“Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?” I asked,\nwhen I had partaken of what she offered me.\n\n“What did you say, my dear? I am a little deaf,” returned the good\nlady, approaching her ear to my mouth.\n\nI repeated the question more distinctly.\n\n“Miss Fairfax? Oh, you mean Miss Varens! Varens is the name of your\nfuture pupil.”\n\n“Indeed! Then she is not your daughter?”\n\n“No,—I have no family.”\n\nI should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss\nVarens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to\nask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.\n\n“I am so glad,” she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took\nthe cat on her knee; “I am so glad you are come; it will be quite\npleasant living here now with a companion. To be sure it is pleasant at\nany time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late\nyears perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in\nwinter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters. I say\nalone—Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very\ndecent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can’t\nconverse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due\ndistance, for fear of losing one’s authority. I’m sure last winter (it\nwas a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it\nrained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to\nthe house, from November till February; and I really got quite\nmelancholy with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read\nto me sometimes; but I don’t think the poor girl liked the task much:\nshe felt it confining. In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine\nand long days make such a difference; and then, just at the\ncommencement of this autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a\nchild makes a house alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be\nquite gay.”\n\nMy heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I\ndrew my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish\nthat she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.\n\n“But I’ll not keep you sitting up late to-night,” said she; “it is on\nthe stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you\nmust feel tired. If you have got your feet well warmed, I’ll show you\nyour bedroom. I’ve had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is\nonly a small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one\nof the large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but\nthey are so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself.”\n\nI thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued\nwith my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire. She took her\ncandle, and I followed her from the room. First she went to see if the\nhall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the\nway upstairs. The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window\nwas high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the\nbedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than\na house. A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and\ngallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was\nglad, when finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small\ndimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.\n\nWhen Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened\nmy door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie\nimpression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase,\nand that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room,\nI remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I\nwas now at last in safe haven. The impulse of gratitude swelled my\nheart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where\nthanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my\nfurther path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so\nfrankly offered me before it was earned. My couch had no thorns in it\nthat night; my solitary room no fears. At once weary and content, I\nslept soon and soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.\n\nThe chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in\nbetween the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and\na carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of\nLowood, that my spirits rose at the view. Externals have a great effect\non the young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me,\none that was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns\nand toils. My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field\noffered to hope, seemed all astir. I cannot precisely define what they\nexpected, but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that\nmonth, but at an indefinite future period.\n\nI rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain—for I had no\narticle of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity—I was still\nby nature solicitous to be neat. It was not my habit to be disregardful\nof appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I\never wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my\nwant of beauty would permit. I sometimes regretted that I was not\nhandsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and\nsmall cherry mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed\nin figure; I felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and\nhad features so irregular and so marked. And why had I these\naspirations and these regrets? It would be difficult to say: I could\nnot then distinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a\nlogical, natural reason too. However, when I had brushed my hair very\nsmooth, and put on my black frock—which, Quakerlike as it was, at least\nhad the merit of fitting to a nicety—and adjusted my clean white\ntucker, I thought I should do respectably enough to appear before Mrs.\nFairfax, and that my new pupil would not at least recoil from me with\nantipathy. Having opened my chamber window, and seen that I left all\nthings straight and neat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.\n\nTraversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps\nof oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at\nsome pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in\na cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at\na bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was\nof oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.\nEverything appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so\nlittle accustomed to grandeur. The hall-door, which was half of glass,\nstood open; I stepped over the threshold. It was a fine autumn morning;\nthe early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green\nfields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of\nthe mansion. It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though\nconsiderable: a gentleman’s manor-house, not a nobleman’s seat:\nbattlements round the top gave it a picturesque look. Its grey front\nstood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants\nwere now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in\na great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and\nwhere an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as\noaks, at once explained the etymology of the mansion’s designation.\nFarther off were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so\ncraggy, nor so like barriers of separation from the living world; but\nyet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield\nwith a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the\nstirring locality of Millcote. A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent\nwith trees, straggled up the side of one of these hills; the church of\nthe district stood nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a\nknoll between the house and gates.\n\nI was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet\nlistening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the\nwide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was\nfor one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady\nappeared at the door.\n\n“What! out already?” said she. “I see you are an early riser.” I went\nup to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.\n\n“How do you like Thornfield?” she asked. I told her I liked it very\nmuch.\n\n“Yes,” she said, “it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting\nout of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come\nand reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener:\ngreat houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor.”\n\n“Mr. Rochester!” I exclaimed. “Who is he?”\n\n“The owner of Thornfield,” she responded quietly. “Did you not know he\nwas called Rochester?”\n\nOf course I did not—I had never heard of him before; but the old lady\nseemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with\nwhich everybody must be acquainted by instinct.\n\n“I thought,” I continued, “Thornfield belonged to you.”\n\n“To me? Bless you, child; what an idea! To me! I am only the\nhousekeeper—the manager. To be sure I am distantly related to the\nRochesters by the mother’s side, or at least my husband was; he was a\nclergyman, incumbent of Hay—that little village yonder on the hill—and\nthat church near the gates was his. The present Mr. Rochester’s mother\nwas a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on\nthe connection—in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in\nthe light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and\nI expect nothing more.”\n\n“And the little girl—my pupil!”\n\n“She is Mr. Rochester’s ward; he commissioned me to find a governess\nfor her. He intended to have her brought up in ——shire, I believe. Here\nshe comes, with her ‘bonne,’ as she calls her nurse.” The enigma then\nwas explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame;\nbut a dependent like myself. I did not like her the worse for that; on\nthe contrary, I felt better pleased than ever. The equality between her\nand me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so\nmuch the better—my position was all the freer.\n\nAs I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her\nattendant, came running up the lawn. I looked at my pupil, who did not\nat first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or\neight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and\na redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.\n\n“Good morning, Miss Adela,” said Mrs. Fairfax. “Come and speak to the\nlady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day.” She\napproached.\n\n“C’est là ma gouvernante!” said she, pointing to me, and addressing her\nnurse; who answered—\n\n“Mais oui, certainement.”\n\n“Are they foreigners?” I inquired, amazed at hearing the French\nlanguage.\n\n“The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I\nbelieve, never left it till within six months ago. When she first came\nhere she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a\nlittle: I don’t understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you\nwill make out her meaning very well, I dare say.”\n\nFortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French\nlady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame\nPierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven\nyears, learnt a portion of French by heart daily—applying myself to\ntake pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as possible the\npronunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of\nreadiness and correctness in the language, and was not likely to be\nmuch at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela. She came and shook hands with\nme when she heard that I was her governess; and as I led her in to\nbreakfast, I addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue: she\nreplied briefly at first, but after we were seated at the table, and\nshe had examined me some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes, she\nsuddenly commenced chattering fluently.\n\n“Ah!” cried she, in French, “you speak my language as well as Mr.\nRochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.\nShe will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all\nEnglish. Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great\nship with a chimney that smoked—how it did smoke!—and I was sick, and\nso was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester lay down on a\nsofa in a pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little\nbeds in another place. I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.\nAnd Mademoiselle—what is your name?”\n\n“Eyre—Jane Eyre.”\n\n“Aire? Bah! I cannot say it. Well, our ship stopped in the morning,\nbefore it was quite daylight, at a great city—a huge city, with very\ndark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came\nfrom; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the\nland, and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us\nto a beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an\nhotel. We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every\nday in a great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there\nwere many children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in\nit, that I fed with crumbs.”\n\n“Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?” asked Mrs. Fairfax.\n\nI understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent\ntongue of Madame Pierrot.\n\n“I wish,” continued the good lady, “you would ask her a question or two\nabout her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?”\n\n“Adèle,” I inquired, “with whom did you live when you were in that\npretty clean town you spoke of?”\n\n“I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin. Mama\nused to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses. A great many\ngentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,\nor to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it. Shall I let you\nhear me sing now?”\n\nShe had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen\nof her accomplishments. Descending from her chair, she came and placed\nherself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,\nshaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she\ncommenced singing a song from some opera. It was the strain of a\nforsaken lady, who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls\npride to her aid; desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest\njewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night\nat a ball, and prove to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little\nhis desertion has affected her.\n\nThe subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose\nthe point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and\njealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that\npoint was: at least I thought so.\n\nAdèle sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naïveté_ of\nher age. This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, “Now,\nMademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry.”\n\nAssuming an attitude, she began, “La Ligue des Rats: fable de La\nFontaine.” She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to\npunctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness\nof gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had\nbeen carefully trained.\n\n“Was it your mama who taught you that piece?” I asked.\n\n“Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: ‘Qu’avez vous donc? lui\ndit un de ces rats; parlez!’ She made me lift my hand—so—to remind me\nto raise my voice at the question. Now shall I dance for you?”\n\n“No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you\nsay, with whom did you live then?”\n\n“With Madame Frédéric and her husband: she took care of me, but she is\nnothing related to me. I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a\nhouse as mama. I was not long there. Mr. Rochester asked me if I would\nlike to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.\nRochester before I knew Madame Frédéric, and he was always kind to me\nand gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his\nword, for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again\nhimself, and I never see him.”\n\nAfter breakfast, Adèle and I withdrew to the library, which room, it\nappears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.\nMost of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one\nbookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the\nway of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature,\npoetry, biography, travels, a few romances, &c. I suppose he had\nconsidered that these were all the governess would require for her\nprivate perusal; and, indeed, they contented me amply for the present;\ncompared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been able to glean\nat Lowood, they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment\nand information. In this room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite\nnew and of superior tone; also an easel for painting and a pair of\nglobes.\n\nI found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she\nhad not been used to regular occupation of any kind. I felt it would be\ninjudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to\nher a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning\nhad advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse. I then\nproposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little\nsketches for her use.\n\nAs I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax\ncalled to me: “Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose,” said\nshe. She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in\nwhen she addressed me. It was a large, stately apartment, with purple\nchairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast\nwindow rich in stained glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded. Mrs.\nFairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a\nsideboard.\n\n“What a beautiful room!” I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had\nnever before seen any half so imposing.\n\n“Yes; this is the dining-room. I have just opened the window, to let in\na little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments\nthat are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault.”\n\nShe pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like\nit with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up. Mounting to it by two\nbroad steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a\nfairy place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond. Yet\nit was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both\nspread with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of\nflowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and\nvine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and\nottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of\nsparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between the windows large\nmirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire.\n\n“In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!” said I. “No dust,\nno canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think\nthey were inhabited daily.”\n\n“Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester’s visits here are rare, they are\nalways sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to\nfind everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his\narrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness.”\n\n“Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?”\n\n“Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman’s tastes and habits, and\nhe expects to have things managed in conformity to them.”\n\n“Do you like him? Is he generally liked?”\n\n“Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here. Almost all the\nland in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the\nRochesters time out of mind.”\n\n“Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him? Is\nhe liked for himself?”\n\n“_I_ have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is\nconsidered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never\nlived much amongst them.”\n\n“But has he no peculiarities? What, in short, is his character?”\n\n“Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose. He is rather peculiar,\nperhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the\nworld, I should think. I dare say he is clever, but I never had much\nconversation with him.”\n\n“In what way is he peculiar?”\n\n“I don’t know—it is not easy to describe—nothing striking, but you feel\nit when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in\njest or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don’t\nthoroughly understand him, in short—at least, I don’t: but it is of no\nconsequence, he is a very good master.”\n\nThis was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and\nmine. There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a\ncharacter, or observing and describing salient points, either in\npersons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my\nqueries puzzled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr.\nRochester in her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor—nothing more:\nshe inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish\nto gain a more definite notion of his identity.\n\nWhen we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of\nthe house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I\nwent; for all was well arranged and handsome. The large front chambers\nI thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though\ndark and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity. The\nfurniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to\ntime been removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light\nentering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years\nold; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of\npalm branches and cherubs’ heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of\nvenerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated,\non whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced\nembroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been\ncoffin-dust. All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield\nHall the aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory. I liked the\nhush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I by\nno means coveted a night’s repose on one of those wide and heavy beds:\nshut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with wrought\nold English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies of\nstrange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,—all\nwhich would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of\nmoonlight.\n\n“Do the servants sleep in these rooms?” I asked.\n\n“No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever\nsleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at\nThornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.”\n\n“So I think: you have no ghost, then?”\n\n“None that I ever heard of,” returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.\n\n“Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?”\n\n“I believe not. And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a\nviolent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the\nreason they rest tranquilly in their graves now.”\n\n“Yes—‘after life’s fitful fever they sleep well,’” I muttered. “Where\nare you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?” for she was moving away.\n\n“On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?” I\nfollowed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by\na ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall. I was now on\na level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests. Leaning\nover the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid\nout like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey\nbase of the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient\ntimber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown,\ngreener with moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the\ngates, the road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day’s\nsun; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with\npearly white. No feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was\npleasing. When I turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could\nscarcely see my way down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault\ncompared with that arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and\nto that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the\nhall was the centre, and over which I had been gazing with delight.\n\nMrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by dint\nof groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend\nthe narrow garret staircase. I lingered in the long passage to which\nthis led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey:\nnarrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and\nlooking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a\ncorridor in some Bluebeard’s castle.\n\nWhile I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still\na region, a laugh, struck my ear. It was a curious laugh; distinct,\nformal, mirthless. I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it\nbegan again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low. It\npassed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every\nlonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have\npointed out the door whence the accents issued.\n\n“Mrs. Fairfax!” I called out: for I now heard her descending the great\nstairs. “Did you hear that loud laugh? Who is it?”\n\n“Some of the servants, very likely,” she answered: “perhaps Grace\nPoole.”\n\n“Did you hear it?” I again inquired.\n\n“Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.\nSometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together.”\n\nThe laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an\nodd murmur.\n\n“Grace!” exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.\n\nI really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as\ntragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it\nwas high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the\ncurious cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear,\nI should have been superstitiously afraid. However, the event showed me\nI was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.\n\nThe door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,—a woman of between\nthirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a\nhard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could\nscarcely be conceived.\n\n“Too much noise, Grace,” said Mrs. Fairfax. “Remember directions!”\nGrace curtseyed silently and went in.\n\n“She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid’s\nwork,” continued the widow; “not altogether unobjectionable in some\npoints, but she does well enough. By-the-bye, how have you got on with\nyour new pupil this morning?”\n\nThe conversation, thus turned on Adèle, continued till we reached the\nlight and cheerful region below. Adèle came running to meet us in the\nhall, exclaiming—\n\n“Mesdames, vous êtes servies!” adding, “J’ai bien faim, moi!”\n\nWe found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax’s room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nThe promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to\nThornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer\nacquaintance with the place and its inmates. Mrs. Fairfax turned out to\nbe what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of\ncompetent education and average intelligence. My pupil was a lively\nchild, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes\nwayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no\ninjudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for\nher improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient\nand teachable. She had no great talents, no marked traits of character,\nno peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch\nabove the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had she any\ndeficiency or vice which sunk her below it. She made reasonable\nprogress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps not very\nprofound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to\nplease, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attachment sufficient\nto make us both content in each other’s society.\n\nThis, _par parenthèse_, will be thought cool language by persons who\nentertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and\nthe duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an\nidolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism,\nto echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth. I felt\na conscientious solicitude for Adèle’s welfare and progress, and a\nquiet liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs.\nFairfax a thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society\nproportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation\nof her mind and character.\n\nAnybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,\nwhen I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the\ngates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adèle\nplayed with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom,\nI climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and\nhaving reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and\nhill, and along dim sky-line—that then I longed for a power of vision\nwhich might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world,\ntowns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen—that then I\ndesired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of\nintercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character,\nthan was here within my reach. I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax,\nand what was good in Adèle; but I believed in the existence of other\nand more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to\nbehold.\n\nWho blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented. I\ncould not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to\npain sometimes. Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of\nthe third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and\nsolitude of the spot, and allow my mind’s eye to dwell on whatever\nbright visions rose before it—and, certainly, they were many and\nglowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which,\nwhile it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of\nall, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended—a tale my\nimagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of\nincident, life, fire, feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual\nexistence.\n\nIt is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with\ntranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they\ncannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and\nmillions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many\nrebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life\nwhich people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but\nwomen feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties,\nand a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they\nsuffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely\nas men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged\nfellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making\npuddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and\nembroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them,\nif they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced\nnecessary for their sex.\n\nWhen thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole’s laugh: the same\npeal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled\nme: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh. There\nwere days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could\nnot account for the sounds she made. Sometimes I saw her: she would\ncome out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand,\ngo down to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic\nreader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of\nporter. Her appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised\nby her oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to\nwhich interest could attach. I made some attempts to draw her into\nconversation, but she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic\nreply usually cut short every effort of that sort.\n\nThe other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the\nhousemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no\nrespect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I\nasked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a\ndescriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and\nconfused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage\ninquiry.\n\nOctober, November, December passed away. One afternoon in January, Mrs.\nFairfax had begged a holiday for Adèle, because she had a cold; and, as\nAdèle seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious\noccasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,\ndeeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point. It was a\nfine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the\nlibrary through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a\nletter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak\nand volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a\npleasant winter afternoon walk. Having seen Adèle comfortably seated in\nher little chair by Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour fireside, and given her her\nbest wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a\ndrawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and\nhaving replied to her “Revenez bientôt, ma bonne amie, ma chère Mdlle.\nJeannette,” with a kiss I set out.\n\nThe ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked\nfast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the\nspecies of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation. It was\nthree o’clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the\ncharm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding\nand pale-beaming sun. I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for\nwild roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now\npossessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best\nwinter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose. If a\nbreath of air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a\nholly, not an evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel\nbushes were as still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the\nmiddle of the path. Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields,\nwhere no cattle now browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred\noccasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had\nforgotten to drop.\n\nThis lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the\nmiddle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field. Gathering\nmy mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel\nthe cold, though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice\ncovering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had\noverflowed after a rapid thaw some days since. From my seat I could\nlook down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the\nprincipal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose\nagainst the west. I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees,\nand sank crimson and clear behind them. I then turned eastward.\n\nOn the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but\nbrightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in\ntrees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile\ndistant, but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs\nof life. My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and\ndepths I could not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and\ndoubtless many becks threading their passes. That evening calm betrayed\nalike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.\n\nA rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so\nfar away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter,\nwhich effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid\nmass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and\nstrong on the foreground, efface the aërial distance of azure hill,\nsunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.\n\nThe din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the\nlane yet hid it, but it approached. I was just leaving the stile; yet,\nas the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by. In those days I\nwas young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind:\nthe memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and\nwhen they recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness\nbeyond what childhood could give. As this horse approached, and as I\nwatched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of\nBessie’s tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a\n“Gytrash,” which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted\nsolitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this\nhorse was now coming upon me.\n\nIt was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,\ntramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel\nstems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a\ndistinct object against the trees. It was exactly one form of Bessie’s\nGytrash—a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed\nme, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange\npretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would. The horse\nfollowed,—a tall steed, and on its back a rider. The man, the human\nbeing, broke the spell at once. Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was\nalways alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the\ndumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace\nhuman form. No Gytrash was this,—only a traveller taking the short cut\nto Millcote. He passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a\nsliding sound and an exclamation of “What the deuce is to do now?” and\na clattering tumble, arrested my attention. Man and horse were down;\nthey had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway. The dog\ncame bounding back, and seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing\nthe horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which\nwas deep in proportion to his magnitude. He snuffed round the prostrate\ngroup, and then he ran up to me; it was all he could do,—there was no\nother help at hand to summon. I obeyed him, and walked down to the\ntraveller, by this time struggling himself free of his steed. His\nefforts were so vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I\nasked him the question—\n\n“Are you injured, sir?”\n\nI think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was\npronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me\ndirectly.\n\n“Can I do anything?” I asked again.\n\n“You must just stand on one side,” he answered as he rose, first to his\nknees, and then to his feet. I did; whereupon began a heaving,\nstamping, clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which\nremoved me effectually some yards’ distance; but I would not be driven\nquite away till I saw the event. This was finally fortunate; the horse\nwas re-established, and the dog was silenced with a “Down, Pilot!” The\ntraveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether\nthey were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the\nstile whence I had just risen, and sat down.\n\nI was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for\nI now drew near him again.\n\n“If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from\nThornfield Hall or from Hay.”\n\n“Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,—only a sprain;” and\nagain he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an\ninvoluntary “Ugh!”\n\nSomething of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I\ncould see him plainly. His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur\ncollared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced\nthe general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.\nHe had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and\ngathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past\nyouth, but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.\nI felt no fear of him, and but little shyness. Had he been a handsome,\nheroic-looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus\nquestioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked. I\nhad hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.\nI had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance,\ngallantry, fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in\nmasculine shape, I should have known instinctively that they neither\nhad nor could have sympathy with anything in me, and should have\nshunned them as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is\nbright but antipathetic.\n\nIf even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I\naddressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with\nthanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew\ninquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my\nease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced—\n\n“I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this\nsolitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse.”\n\nHe looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my\ndirection before.\n\n“I should think you ought to be at home yourself,” said he, “if you\nhave a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?”\n\n“From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it\nis moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish\nit: indeed, I am going there to post a letter.”\n\n“You live just below—do you mean at that house with the battlements?”\npointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,\nbringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with\nthe western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Whose house is it?”\n\n“Mr. Rochester’s.”\n\n“Do you know Mr. Rochester?”\n\n“No, I have never seen him.”\n\n“He is not resident, then?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Can you tell me where he is?”\n\n“I cannot.”\n\n“You are not a servant at the hall, of course. You are—” He stopped,\nran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black\nmerino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough\nfor a lady’s-maid. He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped\nhim.\n\n“I am the governess.”\n\n“Ah, the governess!” he repeated; “deuce take me, if I had not\nforgotten! The governess!” and again my raiment underwent scrutiny. In\ntwo minutes he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he\ntried to move.\n\n“I cannot commission you to fetch help,” he said; “but you may help me\na little yourself, if you will be so kind.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Try to get hold of my horse’s bridle and lead him to me: you are not\nafraid?”\n\nI should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to\ndo it, I was disposed to obey. I put down my muff on the stile, and\nwent up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it\nwas a spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made\neffort on effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of\nits trampling fore-feet. The traveller waited and watched for some\ntime, and at last he laughed.\n\n\nI was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet\n\n“I see,” he said, “the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so\nall you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of\nyou to come here.”\n\nI came. “Excuse me,” he continued: “necessity compels me to make you\nuseful.” He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with\nsome stress, limped to his horse. Having once caught the bridle, he\nmastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he\nmade the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.\n\n“Now,” said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, “just hand me\nmy whip; it lies there under the hedge.”\n\nI sought it and found it.\n\n“Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast\nas you can.”\n\nA touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then\nbound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,\n\n“Like heath that, in the wilderness,\n    The wild wind whirls away.”\n\n\nI took up my muff and walked on. The incident had occurred and was gone\nfor me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a\nsense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.\nMy help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to\nhave done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was\nyet an active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive. The\nnew face, too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of\nmemory; and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly,\nbecause it was masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong,\nand stern. I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the\nletter into the post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all\nthe way home. When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked\nround and listened, with an idea that a horse’s hoofs might ring on the\ncauseway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like\nNewfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a\npollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the\nmoonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among\nthe trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in\nthe direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught\na light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I\nhurried on.\n\nI did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to\nreturn to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome\nstaircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil\nMrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,\nwas to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,—to slip\nagain over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too\nstill existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and\nease I was becoming incapable of appreciating. What good it would have\ndone me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain\nstruggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience\nto long for the calm amidst which I now repined! Yes, just as much good\nas it would do a man tired of sitting still in a “too easy chair” to\ntake a long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my\ncircumstances, as it would be under his.\n\nI lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and\nforwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I\ncould not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed\ndrawn from the gloomy house—from the grey hollow filled with rayless\ncells, as it appeared to me—to that sky expanded before me,—a blue sea\nabsolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march;\nher orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which\nshe had come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith,\nmidnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for\nthose trembling stars that followed her course; they made my heart\ntremble, my veins glow when I viewed them. Little things recall us to\nearth; the clock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon\nand stars, opened a side-door, and went in.\n\nThe hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze\nlamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak\nstaircase. This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose\ntwo-leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate,\nglancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple\ndraperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance. It\nrevealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it,\nand scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst\nwhich I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adèle, when the door closed.\n\nI hastened to Mrs. Fairfax’s room; there was a fire there too, but no\ncandle, and no Mrs. Fairfax. Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the\nrug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and\nwhite long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane. It was so\nlike it that I went forward and said—“Pilot,” and the thing got up and\ncame to me and snuffed me. I caressed him, and he wagged his great\ntail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not\ntell whence he had come. I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I\nwanted, too, to get an account of this visitant. Leah entered.\n\n“What dog is this?”\n\n“He came with master.”\n\n“With whom?”\n\n“With master—Mr. Rochester—he is just arrived.”\n\n“Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?”\n\n“Yes, and Miss Adèle; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for\na surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle\nis sprained.”\n\n“Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?”\n\n“Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.”\n\n“Ah! Bring me a candle will you Leah?”\n\nLeah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated\nthe news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with\nMr. Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I\nwent upstairs to take off my things.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nMr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon’s orders, went to bed early\nthat night; nor did he rise soon next morning. When he did come down,\nit was to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were\narrived, and waiting to speak with him.\n\nAdèle and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily\nrequisition as a reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an\napartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for\nthe future schoolroom. I discerned in the course of the morning that\nThornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it\nechoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the\nbell; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in\ndifferent keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through\nit; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.\n\nAdèle was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept\nrunning to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could\nget a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go\ndownstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,\nwhere I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and\nmade her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her “ami,\nMonsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester,” as she dubbed him (I had not\nbefore heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had\nbrought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that\nwhen his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a\nlittle box in whose contents she had an interest.\n\n“Et cela doit signifier,” said she, “qu’il y aura là dedans un cadeau\npour moi, et peut-être pour vous aussi, mademoiselle. Monsieur a parlé\nde vous: il m’a demandé le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n’était\npas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pâle. J’ai dit qu’oui:\ncar c’est vrai, n’est-ce pas, mademoiselle?”\n\nI and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour; the afternoon\nwas wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom. At dark I\nallowed Adèle to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,\nfrom the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals\nto the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.\nLeft alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:\ntwilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very\nshrubs on the lawn. I let down the curtain and went back to the\nfireside.\n\nIn the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I\nremembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when\nMrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I\nhad been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome\nthoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude.\n\n“Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with\nhim in the drawing-room this evening,” said she: “he has been so much\nengaged all day that he could not ask to see you before.”\n\n“When is his tea-time?” I inquired.\n\n“Oh, at six o’clock: he keeps early hours in the country. You had\nbetter change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it. Here is\na candle.”\n\n“Is it necessary to change my frock?”\n\n“Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester\nis here.”\n\nThis additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired\nto my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax’s aid, replaced my black stuff dress\nby one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had,\nexcept one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette,\nI thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.\n\n“You want a brooch,” said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single little pearl\nornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,\nand then we went downstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was\nrather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester’s\npresence. I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept\nin her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose\ncurtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.\n\nTwo wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;\nbasking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot—Adèle knelt\nnear him. Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot\nsupported by the cushion; he was looking at Adèle and the dog: the fire\nshone full on his face. I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty\neyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of\nhis black hair. I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for\ncharacter than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;\nhis grim mouth, chin, and jaw—yes, all three were very grim, and no\nmistake. His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in\nsquareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the\nathletic sense of the term—broad chested and thin flanked, though\nneither tall nor graceful.\n\nMr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and\nmyself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he\nnever lifted his head as we approached.\n\n“Here is Miss Eyre, sir,” said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way. He\nbowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.\n\n“Let Miss Eyre be seated,” said he: and there was something in the\nforced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed\nfurther to express, “What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be\nthere or not? At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.”\n\nI sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness\nwould probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it\nby answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me\nunder no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the\nfreak of manner, gave me the advantage. Besides, the eccentricity of\nthe proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go\non.\n\nHe went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved. Mrs.\nFairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable,\nand she began to talk. Kindly, as usual—and, as usual, rather trite—she\ncondoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on\nthe annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then\nshe commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.\n\n“Madam, I should like some tea,” was the sole rejoinder she got. She\nhastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to\narrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity. I and Adèle\nwent to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.\n\n“Will you hand Mr. Rochester’s cup?” said Mrs. Fairfax to me; “Adèle\nmight perhaps spill it.”\n\nI did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand, Adèle, thinking\nthe moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out—\n\n“N’est-ce pas, monsieur, qu’il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre\ndans votre petit coffre?”\n\n“Who talks of cadeaux?” said he gruffly. “Did you expect a present,\nMiss Eyre? Are you fond of presents?” and he searched my face with eyes\nthat I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.\n\n“I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are\ngenerally thought pleasant things.”\n\n“Generally thought? But what do _you_ think?”\n\n“I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an\nanswer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has\nit not? and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as\nto its nature.”\n\n“Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adèle: she demands a\n‘cadeau,’ clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the\nbush.”\n\n“Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adèle has: she can\nprefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for\nshe says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings;\nbut if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a\nstranger, and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment.”\n\n“Oh, don’t fall back on over-modesty! I have examined Adèle, and find\nyou have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no\ntalents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement.”\n\n“Sir, you have now given me my ‘cadeau;’ I am obliged to you: it is the\nmeed teachers most covet—praise of their pupils’ progress.”\n\n“Humph!” said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.\n\n“Come to the fire,” said the master, when the tray was taken away, and\nMrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adèle\nwas leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful\nbooks and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnières. We obeyed, as in\nduty bound; Adèle wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered\nto amuse herself with Pilot.\n\n“You have been resident in my house three months?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“And you came from—?”\n\n“From Lowood school, in ——shire.”\n\n“Ah! a charitable concern. How long were you there?”\n\n“Eight years.”\n\n“Eight years! you must be tenacious of life. I thought half the time in\nsuch a place would have done up any constitution! No wonder you have\nrather the look of another world. I marvelled where you had got that\nsort of face. When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought\nunaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you\nhad bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet. Who are your parents?”\n\n“I have none.”\n\n“Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I thought not. And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on\nthat stile?”\n\n“For whom, sir?”\n\n“For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them. Did\nI break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on\nthe causeway?”\n\nI shook my head. “The men in green all forsook England a hundred years\nago,” said I, speaking as seriously as he had done. “And not even in\nHay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them. I\ndon’t think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine\non their revels more.”\n\nMrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows,\nseemed wondering what sort of talk this was.\n\n“Well,” resumed Mr. Rochester, “if you disown parents, you must have\nsome sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?”\n\n“No; none that I ever saw.”\n\n“And your home?”\n\n“I have none.”\n\n“Where do your brothers and sisters live?”\n\n“I have no brothers or sisters.”\n\n“Who recommended you to come here?”\n\n“I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.”\n\n“Yes,” said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, “and\nI am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make. Miss Eyre\nhas been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher\nto Adèle.”\n\n“Don’t trouble yourself to give her a character,” returned Mr.\nRochester: “eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself. She\nbegan by felling my horse.”\n\n“Sir?” said Mrs. Fairfax.\n\n“I have to thank her for this sprain.”\n\nThe widow looked bewildered.\n\n“Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Have you seen much society?”\n\n“None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of\nThornfield.”\n\n“Have you read much?”\n\n“Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or\nvery learned.”\n\n“You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in\nreligious forms;—Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a\nparson, is he not?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of\nreligieuses would worship their director.”\n\n“Oh, no.”\n\n“You are very cool! No! What! a novice not worship her priest! That\nsounds blasphemous.”\n\n“I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling. He is\na harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for\neconomy’s sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could\nhardly sew.”\n\n“That was very false economy,” remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again\ncaught the drift of the dialogue.\n\n“And was that the head and front of his offending?” demanded Mr.\nRochester.\n\n“He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision\ndepartment, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with\nlong lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his\nown inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid\nto go to bed.”\n\n“What age were you when you went to Lowood?”\n\n“About ten.”\n\n“And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?”\n\nI assented.\n\n“Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have\nbeen able to guess your age. It is a point difficult to fix where the\nfeatures and countenance are so much at variance as in your case. And\nnow what did you learn at Lowood? Can you play?”\n\n“A little.”\n\n“Of course: that is the established answer. Go into the library—I mean,\nif you please.—(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, ‘Do this,’\nand it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new\ninmate.)—Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the\ndoor open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.”\n\nI departed, obeying his directions.\n\n“Enough!” he called out in a few minutes. “You play _a little_, I see;\nlike any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some,\nbut not well.”\n\nI closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester continued—\n\n“Adèle showed me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.\nI don’t know whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a\nmaster aided you?”\n\n“No, indeed!” I interjected.\n\n“Ah! that pricks pride. Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch\nfor its contents being original; but don’t pass your word unless you\nare certain: I can recognise patchwork.”\n\n“Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir.”\n\nI brought the portfolio from the library.\n\n“Approach the table,” said he; and I wheeled it to his couch. Adèle and\nMrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.\n\n“No crowding,” said Mr. Rochester: “take the drawings from my hand as I\nfinish with them; but don’t push your faces up to mine.”\n\nHe deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting. Three he laid\naside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.\n\n“Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,” said he, “and look at\nthem with Adèle;—you” (glancing at me) “resume your seat, and answer my\nquestions. I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that\nhand yours?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And when did you find time to do them? They have taken much time, and\nsome thought.”\n\n“I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no\nother occupation.”\n\n“Where did you get your copies?”\n\n“Out of my head.”\n\n“That head I see now on your shoulders?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Has it other furniture of the same kind within?”\n\n“I should think it may have: I should hope—better.”\n\nHe spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.\n\nWhile he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and\nfirst, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful. The subjects\nhad, indeed, risen vividly on my mind. As I saw them with the spiritual\neye, before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand\nwould not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a\npale portrait of the thing I had conceived.\n\nThese pictures were in water-colours. The first represented clouds low\nand livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;\nso, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there\nwas no land. One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged\nmast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with\nfoam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched\nwith as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering\ndistinctness as my pencil could impart. Sinking below the bird and\nmast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was\nthe only limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or\ntorn.\n\nThe second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a\nhill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze. Beyond and\nabove spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into\nthe sky was a woman’s shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and\nsoft as I could combine. The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the\nlineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes\nshone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud\ntorn by storm or by electric travail. On the neck lay a pale reflection\nlike moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds\nfrom which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.\n\nThe third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter\nsky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close\nserried, along the horizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the\nforeground, a head,—a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and\nresting against it. Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and\nsupporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil; a brow\nquite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of\nmeaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible. Above\nthe temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in\nits character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame,\ngemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was “the\nlikeness of a kingly crown;” what it diademed was “the shape which\nshape had none.”\n\n“Were you happy when you painted these pictures?” asked Mr. Rochester\npresently.\n\n“I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them, in short,\nwas to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.”\n\n“That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account, have\nbeen few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist’s dreamland\nwhile you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you sit at them\nlong each day?”\n\n“I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at\nthem from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of\nthe midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply.”\n\n“And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?”\n\n“Far from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my\nhandiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite\npowerless to realise.”\n\n“Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,\nprobably. You had not enough of the artist’s skill and science to give\nit full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar. As to\nthe thoughts, they are elfish. These eyes in the Evening Star you must\nhave seen in a dream. How could you make them look so clear, and yet\nnot at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays. And what\nmeaning is that in their solemn depth? And who taught you to paint\nwind? There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top. Where did\nyou see Latmos? For that is Latmos. There! put the drawings away!”\n\nI had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his\nwatch, he said abruptly—\n\n“It is nine o’clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adèle sit up\nso long? Take her to bed.”\n\nAdèle went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,\nbut scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor\nso much.\n\n“I wish you all good-night, now,” said he, making a movement of the\nhand towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and\nwished to dismiss us. Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my\nportfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so\nwithdrew.\n\n“You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,” I\nobserved, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adèle to bed.\n\n“Well, is he?”\n\n“I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.”\n\n“True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed\nto his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities\nof temper, allowance should be made.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Partly because it is his nature—and we can none of us help our nature;\nand partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him,\nand make his spirits unequal.”\n\n“What about?”\n\n“Family troubles, for one thing.”\n\n“But he has no family.”\n\n“Not now, but he has had—or, at least, relatives. He lost his elder\nbrother a few years since.”\n\n“His _elder_ brother?”\n\n“Yes. The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of\nthe property; only about nine years.”\n\n“Nine years is a tolerable time. Was he so very fond of his brother as\nto be still inconsolable for his loss?”\n\n“Why, no—perhaps not. I believe there were some misunderstandings\nbetween them. Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;\nand perhaps he prejudiced his father against him. The old gentleman was\nfond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together. He did\nnot like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious\nthat Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of\nthe name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that\nwere not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief. Old Mr.\nRochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he\nconsidered a painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what\nthe precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his\nspirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it. He is not very\nforgiving: he broke with his family, and now for many years he has led\nan unsettled kind of life. I don’t think he has ever been resident at\nThornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of his brother\nwithout a will left him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he\nshuns the old place.”\n\n“Why should he shun it?”\n\n“Perhaps he thinks it gloomy.”\n\nThe answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.\nFairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit\ninformation of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester’s trials. She\naverred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was\nchiefly from conjecture. It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to\ndrop the subject, which I did accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nFor several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the\nmornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,\ngentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes\nstayed to dine with him. When his sprain was well enough to admit of\nhorse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these\nvisits, as he generally did not come back till late at night.\n\nDuring this interval, even Adèle was seldom sent for to his presence,\nand all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional\nrencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would\nsometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence\nby a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with\ngentlemanlike affability. His changes of mood did not offend me,\nbecause I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb\nand flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.\n\nOne day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in\norder, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away\nearly, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed\nme; but the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not\naccompany them. Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message\ncame that I and Adèle were to go downstairs. I brushed Adèle’s hair and\nmade her neat, and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual\nQuaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch—all being too close and\nplain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement—we descended,\nAdèle wondering whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for,\nowing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed. She was\ngratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we\nentered the dining-room. She appeared to know it by instinct.\n\n“Ma boite! ma boite!” exclaimed she, running towards it.\n\n“Yes, there is your ‘boite’ at last: take it into a corner, you genuine\ndaughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,” said the\ndeep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the\ndepths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside. “And mind,” he\ncontinued, “don’t bother me with any details of the anatomical process,\nor any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be\nconducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?”\n\nAdèle seemed scarcely to need the warning; she had already retired to a\nsofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the\nlid. Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery\nenvelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed—\n\n“Oh ciel! Que c’est beau!” and then remained absorbed in ecstatic\ncontemplation.\n\n“Is Miss Eyre there?” now demanded the master, half rising from his\nseat to look round to the door, near which I still stood.\n\n“Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.” He drew a chair near his own.\n“I am not fond of the prattle of children,” he continued; “for, old\nbachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their\nlisp. It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening\n_tête-à-tête_ with a brat. Don’t draw that chair farther off, Miss\nEyre; sit down exactly where I placed it—if you please, that is.\nConfound these civilities! I continually forget them. Nor do I\nparticularly affect simple-minded old ladies. By-the-bye, I must have\nmine in mind; it won’t do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to\none; and blood is said to be thicker than water.”\n\nHe rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon\narrived, knitting-basket in hand.\n\n“Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose. I have\nforbidden Adèle to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting\nwith repletion; have the goodness to serve her as auditress and\ninterlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever\nperformed.”\n\nAdèle, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her\nsofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory,\nthe waxen contents of her “boite;” pouring out, meantime, explanations\nand raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.\n\n“Now I have performed the part of a good host,” pursued Mr. Rochester,\n“put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at\nliberty to attend to my own pleasure. Miss Eyre, draw your chair still\na little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you\nwithout disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have\nno mind to do.”\n\nI did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat\nin the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders,\nit seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.\n\nWe were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been\nlit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the\nlarge fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and\nample before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still,\nsave the subdued chat of Adèle (she dared not speak loud), and, filling\nup each pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.\n\nMr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different\nto what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern—much less\ngloomy. There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether\nwith wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable. He was,\nin short, in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also\nmore self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning;\nstill he looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against\nthe swelling back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on\nhis granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had\ngreat, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too—not without a certain change\nin their depths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you,\nat least, of that feeling.\n\nHe had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the\nsame length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze\nfastened on his physiognomy.\n\n“You examine me, Miss Eyre,” said he: “do you think me handsome?”\n\nI should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by\nsomething conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow\nslipped from my tongue before I was aware—“No, sir.”\n\n“Ah! By my word! there is something singular about you,” said he: “you\nhave the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple,\nas you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on\nthe carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my\nface; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or\nmakes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round\nrejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque. What do you mean\nby it?”\n\n“Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon. I ought to have replied that\nit was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about\nappearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little\nconsequence, or something of that sort.”\n\n“You ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of little consequence,\nindeed! And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of\nstroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under\nmy ear! Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray? I suppose I have\nall my limbs and all my features like any other man?”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no\npointed repartee: it was only a blunder.”\n\n“Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it. Criticise me:\ndoes my forehead not please you?”\n\nHe lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his\nbrow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an\nabrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have\nrisen.\n\n“Now, ma’am, am I a fool?”\n\n“Far from it, sir. You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in\nreturn whether you are a philanthropist?”\n\n“There again! Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat\nmy head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of\nchildren and old women (low be it spoken!). No, young lady, I am not a\ngeneral philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;” and he pointed to the\nprominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,\nfortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a\nmarked breadth to the upper part of his head: “and, besides, I once had\na kind of rude tenderness of heart. When I was as old as you, I was a\nfeeling fellow enough; partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and\nunlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded\nme with her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as\nan India-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still,\nand with one sentient point in the middle of the lump. Yes: does that\nleave hope for me?”\n\n“Hope of what, sir?”\n\n“Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?”\n\n“Decidedly he has had too much wine,” I thought; and I did not know\nwhat answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he\nwas capable of being re-transformed?\n\n“You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty\nany more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it\nis convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my\nphysiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so\npuzzle on. Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative\nto-night.”\n\nWith this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his\narm on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen\nplainly as well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest,\ndisproportionate almost to his length of limb. I am sure most people\nwould have thought him an ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious\npride in his port; so much ease in his demeanour; such a look of\ncomplete indifference to his own external appearance; so haughty a\nreliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to\natone for the lack of mere personal attractiveness, that, in looking at\nhim, one inevitably shared the indifference, and, even in a blind,\nimperfect sense, put faith in the confidence.\n\n“I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night,” he\nrepeated, “and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier\nwere not sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none\nof these can talk. Adèle is a degree better, but still far below the\nmark; Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will:\nyou puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here. I have almost\nforgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but\nto-night I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and\nrecall what pleases. It would please me now to draw you out—to learn\nmore of you—therefore speak.”\n\nInstead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive\nsmile either.\n\n“Speak,” he urged.\n\n“What about, sir?”\n\n“Whatever you like. I leave both the choice of subject and the manner\nof treating it entirely to yourself.”\n\nAccordingly I sat and said nothing: “If he expects me to talk for the\nmere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed\nhimself to the wrong person,” I thought.\n\n“You are dumb, Miss Eyre.”\n\nI was dumb still. He bent his head a little towards me, and with a\nsingle hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.\n\n“Stubborn?” he said, “and annoyed. Ah! it is consistent. I put my\nrequest in an absurd, almost insolent form. Miss Eyre, I beg your\npardon. The fact is, once for all, I don’t wish to treat you like an\ninferior: that is” (correcting himself), “I claim only such superiority\nas must result from twenty years’ difference in age and a century’s\nadvance in experience. This is legitimate, _et j’y tiens_, as Adèle\nwould say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone,\nthat I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and\ndivert my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one\npoint—cankering as a rusty nail.”\n\nHe had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel\ninsensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.\n\n“I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir—quite willing; but I cannot\nintroduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you? Ask me\nquestions, and I will do my best to answer them.”\n\n“Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to\nbe a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the\ngrounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and\nthat I have battled through a varied experience with many men of many\nnations, and roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly\nwith one set of people in one house?”\n\n“Do as you please, sir.”\n\n“That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very\nevasive one. Reply clearly.”\n\n“I don’t think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you\nare older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I\nhave; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of\nyour time and experience.”\n\n“Humph! Promptly spoken. But I won’t allow that, seeing that it would\nnever suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad,\nuse of both advantages. Leaving superiority out of the question, then,\nyou must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being\npiqued or hurt by the tone of command. Will you?”\n\nI smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar—he seems to\nforget that he pays me £30 per annum for receiving his orders.\n\n“The smile is very well,” said he, catching instantly the passing\nexpression; “but speak too.”\n\n“I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to\ninquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by\ntheir orders.”\n\n“Paid subordinates! What! you are my paid subordinate, are you? Oh yes,\nI had forgotten the salary! Well then, on that mercenary ground, will\nyou agree to let me hector a little?”\n\n“No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget\nit, and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his\ndependency, I agree heartily.”\n\n“And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms\nand phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?”\n\n“I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one\nI rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a\nsalary.”\n\n“Humbug! Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;\ntherefore, keep to yourself, and don’t venture on generalities of which\nyou are intensely ignorant. However, I mentally shake hands with you\nfor your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in\nwhich it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was\nfrank and sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the\ncontrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded\nmisapprehension of one’s meaning are the usual rewards of candour. Not\nthree in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered\nme as you have just done. But I don’t mean to flatter you: if you are\ncast in a different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours:\nNature did it. And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions:\nfor what I yet know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have\nintolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points.”\n\n“And so may you,” I thought. My eye met his as the idea crossed my\nmind: he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been\nspoken as well as imagined—\n\n“Yes, yes, you are right,” said he; “I have plenty of faults of my own:\nI know it, and I don’t wish to palliate them, I assure you. God wot I\nneed not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series\nof deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which\nmight well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself. I\nstarted, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the\nblame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a\nwrong tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the\nright course since: but I might have been very different; I might have\nbeen as good as you—wiser—almost as stainless. I envy you your peace of\nmind, your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory. Little girl, a\nmemory without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure—an\ninexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?”\n\n“How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?”\n\n“All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned\nit to fetid puddle. I was your equal at eighteen—quite your equal.\nNature meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the\nbetter kind, and you see I am not so. You would say you don’t see it;\nat least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware,\nby-the-bye, what you express with that organ; I am quick at\ninterpreting its language). Then take my word for it,—I am not a\nvillain: you are not to suppose that—not to attribute to me any such\nbad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances\nthan to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in\nall the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try\nto put on life. Do you wonder that I avow this to you? Know, that in\nthe course of your future life you will often find yourself elected the\ninvoluntary confidant of your acquaintances’ secrets: people will\ninstinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to\ntell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they\nwill feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their\nindiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less\ncomforting and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its\nmanifestations.”\n\n“How do you know?—how can you guess all this, sir?”\n\n“I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were\nwriting my thoughts in a diary. You would say, I should have been\nsuperior to circumstances; so I should—so I should; but you see I was\nnot. When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I\nturned desperate; then I degenerated. Now, when any vicious simpleton\nexcites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that\nI am better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a\nlevel. I wish I had stood firm—God knows I do! Dread remorse when you\nare tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.”\n\n“Repentance is said to be its cure, sir.”\n\n“It is not its cure. Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform—I\nhave strength yet for that—if—but where is the use of thinking of it,\nhampered, burdened, cursed as I am? Besides, since happiness is\nirrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and\nI _will_ get it, cost what it may.”\n\n“Then you will degenerate still more, sir.”\n\n“Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure? And I\nmay get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the\nmoor.”\n\n“It will sting—it will taste bitter, sir.”\n\n“How do you know?—you never tried it. How very serious—how very solemn\nyou look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head”\n(taking one from the mantelpiece). “You have no right to preach to me,\nyou neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are\nabsolutely unacquainted with its mysteries.”\n\n“I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought\nremorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence.”\n\n“And who talks of error now? I scarcely think the notion that flittered\nacross my brain was an error. I believe it was an inspiration rather\nthan a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing—I know that. Here\nit comes again! It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put\non the robes of an angel of light. I think I must admit so fair a guest\nwhen it asks entrance to my heart.”\n\n“Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.”\n\n“Once more, how do you know? By what instinct do you pretend to\ndistinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from\nthe eternal throne—between a guide and a seducer?”\n\n“I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said\nthe suggestion had returned upon you. I feel sure it will work you more\nmisery if you listen to it.”\n\n“Not at all—it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the\nrest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don’t make yourself uneasy.\nHere, come in, bonny wanderer!”\n\nHe said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his\nown; then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest,\nhe seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.\n\n“Now,” he continued, again addressing me, “I have received the\npilgrim—a disguised deity, as I verily believe. Already it has done me\ngood: my heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine.”\n\n“To speak truth, sir, I don’t understand you at all: I cannot keep up\nthe conversation, because it has got out of my depth. Only one thing, I\nknow: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that\nyou regretted your own imperfection;—one thing I can comprehend: you\nintimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane. It seems\nto me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to\nbecome what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you\nbegan with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would\nin a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections,\nto which you might revert with pleasure.”\n\n“Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am\npaving hell with energy.”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.\nCertainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have\nbeen.”\n\n“And better?”\n\n“And better—so much better as pure ore is than foul dross. You seem to\ndoubt me; I don’t doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives\nare; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes\nand Persians, that both are right.”\n\n“They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them.”\n\n“They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:\nunheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules.”\n\n“That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that\nit is liable to abuse.”\n\n“Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to\nabuse it.”\n\n“You are human and fallible.”\n\n“I am: so are you—what then?”\n\n“The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the\ndivine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted.”\n\n“What power?”\n\n“That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,—‘Let it be\nright.’”\n\n“‘Let it be right’—the very words: you have pronounced them.”\n\n“_May_ it be right then,” I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to\ncontinue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides,\nsensible that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my\npenetration; at least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the\nuncertainty, the vague sense of insecurity, which accompanies a\nconviction of ignorance.\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“To put Adèle to bed: it is past her bedtime.”\n\n“You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx.”\n\n“Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am\ncertainly not afraid.”\n\n“You _are_ afraid—your self-love dreads a blunder.”\n\n“In that sense I do feel apprehensive—I have no wish to talk nonsense.”\n\n“If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should\nmistake it for sense. Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre? Don’t trouble\nyourself to answer—I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very\nmerrily: believe me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am\nnaturally vicious. The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat;\ncontrolling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your\nlimbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother—or father,\nor master, or what you will—to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or\nmove too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural\nwith me, as I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then\nyour looks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they\ndare offer now. I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird\nthrough the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute\ncaptive is there; were it but free, it would soar cloud-high. You are\nstill bent on going?”\n\n“It has struck nine, sir.”\n\n“Never mind,—wait a minute: Adèle is not ready to go to bed yet. My\nposition, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,\nfavours observation. While talking to you, I have also occasionally\nwatched Adèle (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious\nstudy,—reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).\nShe pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk\nfrock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her\nblood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones. ‘Il\nfaut que je l’essaie!’ cried she, ‘et à l’instant même!’ and she rushed\nout of the room. She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process:\nin a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,—a\nminiature of Céline Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the\nrising of—But never mind that. However, my tenderest feelings are about\nto receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether\nit will be realised.”\n\nEre long, Adèle’s little foot was heard tripping across the hall. She\nentered, transformed as her guardian had predicted. A dress of\nrose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could\nbe gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath\nof rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk\nstockings and small white satin sandals.\n\n“Est-ce que ma robe va bien?” cried she, bounding forwards; “et mes\nsouliers? et mes bas? Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!”\n\nAnd spreading out her dress, she chasséed across the room till, having\nreached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,\nthen dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming—\n\n“Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonté;” then rising,\nshe added, “C’est comme cela que maman faisait, n’est-ce pas,\nmonsieur?”\n\n“Pre-cise-ly!” was the answer; “and, ‘comme cela,’ she charmed my\nEnglish gold out of my British breeches’ pocket. I have been green,\ntoo, Miss Eyre,—ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you\nnow than once freshened me. My Spring is gone, however, but it has left\nme that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain\nbe rid of. Not valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that\nit was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but\nhalf a liking to the blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as\njust now. I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle\nof expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work. I’ll\nexplain all this some day. Good-night.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nMr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it. It was one\nafternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adèle in the grounds: and\nwhile she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up\nand down a long beech avenue within sight of her.\n\nHe then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Céline\nVarens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a “_grande\npassion_.” This passion Céline had professed to return with even\nsuperior ardour. He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he\nbelieved, as he said, that she preferred his “_taille d’athlète_” to\nthe elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.\n\n“And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the\nGallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel;\ngave her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres,\ndiamonds, dentelles, &c. In short, I began the process of ruining\nmyself in the received style, like any other spoony. I had not, it\nseems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and\ndestruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to\ndeviate an inch from the beaten centre. I had—as I deserved to have—the\nfate of all other spoonies. Happening to call one evening when Céline\ndid not expect me, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was\ntired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy\nto breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence. No,—I\nexaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about\nher: it was rather a sort of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of\nmusk and amber, than an odour of sanctity. I was just beginning to\nstifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences,\nwhen I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the\nbalcony. It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and\nserene. The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and\ntook out a cigar,—I will take one now, if you will excuse me.”\n\nHere ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a\ncigar; having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah\nincense on the freezing and sunless air, he went on—\n\n“I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was\n_croquant_—(overlook the barbarism)—_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and\nsmoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along\nthe fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in\nan elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses,\nand distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the\n‘voiture’ I had given Céline. She was returning: of course my heart\nthumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant upon. The\ncarriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that\nis the very word for an opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a\ncloak—an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June\nevening—I knew her instantly by her little foot, seen peeping from the\nskirt of her dress, as she skipped from the carriage-step. Bending over\nthe balcony, I was about to murmur ‘Mon ange’—in a tone, of course,\nwhich should be audible to the ear of love alone—when a figure jumped\nfrom the carriage after her; cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel\nwhich had rung on the pavement, and that was a hatted head which now\npassed under the arched _porte cochère_ of the hotel.\n\n“You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre? Of course not: I need not\nask you; because you never felt love. You have both sentiments yet to\nexperience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall\nwaken it. You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in\nwhich your youth has hitherto slid away. Floating on with closed eyes\nand muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in\nthe bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base. But I\ntell you—and you may mark my words—you will come some day to a craggy\npass in the channel, where the whole of life’s stream will be broken up\ninto whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to\natoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave\ninto a calmer current—as I am now.\n\n“I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and\nstillness of the world under this frost. I like Thornfield, its\nantiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey\nfaçade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet\nhow long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a\ngreat plague-house? How I do still abhor—”\n\nHe ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his\nboot against the hard ground. Some hated thought seemed to have him in\nits grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.\n\nWe were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before\nus. Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such\nas I never saw before or since. Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,\ndetestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the\nlarge pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow. Wild was the wrestle which\nshould be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something\nhard and cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and\npetrified his countenance: he went on—\n\n“During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point\nwith my destiny. She stood there, by that beech-trunk—a hag like one of\nthose who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres. ‘You like\nThornfield?’ she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the\nair a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the\nhouse-front, between the upper and lower row of windows, ‘Like it if\nyou can! Like it if you dare!’\n\n“‘I will like it,’ said I; ‘I dare like it;’ and” (he subjoined\nmoodily) “I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to\ngoodness—yes, goodness. I wish to be a better man than I have been,\nthan I am; as Job’s leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the\nhabergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will\nesteem but straw and rotten wood.”\n\nAdèle here ran before him with her shuttlecock. “Away!” he cried\nharshly; “keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!” Continuing\nthen to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the\npoint whence he had abruptly diverged—\n\n“Did you leave the balcony, sir,” I asked, “when Mdlle. Varens\nentered?”\n\nI almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on\nthe contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his\neyes towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow. “Oh, I had\nforgotten Céline! Well, to resume. When I saw my charmer thus come in\naccompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake\nof jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony,\nglided within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my\nheart’s core. Strange!” he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the\npoint. “Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this,\nyoung lady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if\nit were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell\nstories of his opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like\nyou! But the last singularity explains the first, as I intimated once\nbefore: you, with your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made\nto be the recipient of secrets. Besides, I know what sort of a mind I\nhave placed in communication with my own: I know it is one not liable\nto take infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one. Happily I\ndo not mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.\nThe more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you,\nyou may refresh me.” After this digression he proceeded—\n\n“I remained in the balcony. ‘They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,’\nthought I: ‘let me prepare an ambush.’ So putting my hand in through\nthe open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening\nthrough which I could take observations; then I closed the casement,\nall but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers’\nwhispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the\npair came in. My eye was quickly at the aperture. Céline’s chamber-maid\nentered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew. The couple\nwere thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there\nwas ‘the Varens,’ shining in satin and jewels,—my gifts of course,—and\nthere was her companion in an officer’s uniform; and I knew him for a\nyoung roué of a vicomte—a brainless and vicious youth whom I had\nsometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I\ndespised him so absolutely. On recognising him, the fang of the snake\nJealousy was instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for\nCéline sank under an extinguisher. A woman who could betray me for such\na rival was not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less,\nhowever, than I, who had been her dupe.\n\n“They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,\nmercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary\nthan enrage a listener. A card of mine lay on the table; this being\nperceived, brought my name under discussion. Neither of them possessed\nenergy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely\nas they could in their little way: especially Céline, who even waxed\nrather brilliant on my personal defects—deformities she termed them.\nNow it had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of\nwhat she called my ‘_beauté mâle_:’ wherein she differed diametrically\nfrom you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you\ndid not think me handsome. The contrast struck me at the time and—”\n\nAdèle here came running up again.\n\n“Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and\nwishes to see you.”\n\n“Ah! in that case I must abridge. Opening the window, I walked in upon\nthem; liberated Céline from my protection; gave her notice to vacate\nher hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded\nscreams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an\nappointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.\nNext morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in\none of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the\npip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew. But unluckily the\nVarens, six months before, had given me this filette Adèle, who, she\naffirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no\nproofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more\nlike me than she. Some years after I had broken with the mother, she\nabandoned her child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer. I\nacknowledged no natural claim on Adèle’s part to be supported by me,\nnor do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that\nshe was quite destitute, I e’en took the poor thing out of the slime\nand mud of Paris, and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the\nwholesome soil of an English country garden. Mrs. Fairfax found you to\ntrain it; but now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a\nFrench opera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your post and\nprotégée: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have\nfound another place—that you beg me to look out for a new governess,\n&c.—Eh?”\n\n“No: Adèle is not answerable for either her mother’s faults or yours: I\nhave a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,\nparentless—forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir—I shall\ncling closer to her than before. How could I possibly prefer the spoilt\npet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to\na lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?”\n\n“Oh, that is the light in which you view it! Well, I must go in now;\nand you too: it darkens.”\n\nBut I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adèle and Pilot—ran a race\nwith her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock. When we went\nin, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept\nher there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking\neven some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to\nstray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of\ncharacter, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an\nEnglish mind. Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to\nappreciate all that was good in her to the utmost. I sought in her\ncountenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none:\nno trait, no turn of expression announced relationship. It was a pity:\nif she could but have been proved to resemble him, he would have\nthought more of her.\n\nIt was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,\nthat I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me. As he had\nsaid, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance\nof the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman’s passion for a French\ndancer, and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no\ndoubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the\nparoxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the\nact of expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly\nrevived pleasure in the old hall and its environs. I meditated\nwonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it\nfor the present inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my\nmaster’s manner to myself. The confidence he had thought fit to repose\nin me seemed a tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as\nsuch. His deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards\nme than at the first. I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits\nof chilling hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed\nwelcome; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when\nsummoned by formal invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a\ncordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power\nto amuse him, and that these evening conferences were sought as much\nfor his pleasure as for my benefit.\n\nI, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with\nrelish. It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a\nmind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do\nnot mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their\ninterest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange\nnovelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in\nreceiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he\nportrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he\ndisclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.\n\nThe ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly\nfrankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to\nhim. I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:\nyet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it\nwas his way. So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest\nadded to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin\ncrescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled\nup; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.\n\nAnd was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude, and\nmany associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object\nI best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the\nbrightest fire. Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could\nnot, for he brought them frequently before me. He was proud, sardonic,\nharsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew\nthat his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many\nothers. He was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when\nsent for to read to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with\nhis head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose,\nalmost a malignant, scowl blackened his features. But I believed that\nhis moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say\n_former_, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their source in some\ncruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a man of better\ntendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as\ncircumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny\nencouraged. I thought there were excellent materials in him; though for\nthe present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled. I cannot\ndeny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would have\ngiven much to assuage it.\n\nThough I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I\ncould not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue,\nand told how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be\nhappy at Thornfield.\n\n“Why not?” I asked myself. “What alienates him from the house? Will he\nleave it again soon? Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer\nthan a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.\nIf he does go, the change will be doleful. Suppose he should be absent\nspring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will\nseem!”\n\nI hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any\nrate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and\nlugubrious, which sounded, I thought, just above me. I wished I had\nkept my candle burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were\ndepressed. I rose and sat up in bed, listening. The sound was hushed.\n\nI tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward\ntranquillity was broken. The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.\nJust then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had\nswept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside. I\nsaid, “Who is there?” Nothing answered. I was chilled with fear.\n\nAll at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the\nkitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up\nto the threshold of Mr. Rochester’s chamber: I had seen him lying there\nmyself in the mornings. The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.\nSilence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again\nthrough the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber. But it\nwas not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream had scarcely\napproached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing\nincident enough.\n\nThis was a demoniac laugh—low, suppressed, and deep—uttered, as it\nseemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door. The head of my bed was\nnear the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my\nbedside—or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and\ncould see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was\nreiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels. My first impulse\nwas to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, “Who is\nthere?”\n\nSomething gurgled and moaned. Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery\ntowards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut\nin that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.\n\n“Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?” thought I.\nImpossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax. I\nhurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the\ndoor with a trembling hand. There was a candle burning just outside,\nand on the matting in the gallery. I was surprised at this\ncircumstance: but still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite\ndim, as if filled with smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and\nleft, to find whence these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware\nof a strong smell of burning.\n\nSomething creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr.\nRochester’s, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence. I thought no\nmore of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh:\nin an instant, I was within the chamber. Tongues of flame darted round\nthe bed: the curtains were on fire. In the midst of blaze and vapour,\nMr. Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.\n\n“Wake! wake!” I cried. I shook him, but he only murmured and turned:\nthe smoke had stupefied him. Not a moment could be lost: the very\nsheets were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one\nwas wide and the other deep, and both were filled with water. I heaved\nthem up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room,\nbrought my own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God’s aid,\nsucceeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.\n\nThe hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I\nflung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of\nthe shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.\nThough it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him\nfulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of\nwater.\n\n“Is there a flood?” he cried.\n\n“No, sir,” I answered; “but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are\nquenched now; I will fetch you a candle.”\n\n“In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?” he\ndemanded. “What have you done with me, witch, sorceress? Who is in the\nroom besides you? Have you plotted to drown me?”\n\n“I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven’s name, get up.\nSomebody has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and\nwhat it is.”\n\n“There! I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two\nminutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be—yes,\nhere is my dressing-gown. Now run!”\n\nI did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery. He\ntook it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened\nand scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.\n\n“What is it? and who did it?” he asked.\n\nI briefly related to him what had transpired: the strange laugh I had\nheard in the gallery: the step ascending to the third storey; the\nsmoke,—the smell of fire which had conducted me to his room; in what\nstate I had found matters there, and how I had deluged him with all the\nwater I could lay hands on.\n\n\n“What is it and who did it?” he asked\n\nHe listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more\nconcern than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had\nconcluded.\n\n“Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?” I asked.\n\n“Mrs. Fairfax? No; what the deuce would you call her for? What can she\ndo? Let her sleep unmolested.”\n\n“Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife.”\n\n“Not at all: just be still. You have a shawl on. If you are not warm\nenough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down\nin the arm-chair: there,—I will put it on. Now place your feet on the\nstool, to keep them out of the wet. I am going to leave you a few\nminutes. I shall take the candle. Remain where you are till I return;\nbe as still as a mouse. I must pay a visit to the second storey. Don’t\nmove, remember, or call any one.”\n\nHe went: I watched the light withdraw. He passed up the gallery very\nsoftly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,\nshut it after him, and the last ray vanished. I was left in total\ndarkness. I listened for some noise, but heard nothing. A very long\ntime elapsed. I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and\nthen I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.\nI was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester’s displeasure by disobeying\nhis orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall,\nand I heard his unshod feet tread the matting. “I hope it is he,”\nthought I, “and not something worse.”\n\nHe re-entered, pale and very gloomy. “I have found it all out,” said\nhe, setting his candle down on the washstand; “it is as I thought.”\n\n“How, sir?”\n\nHe made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the\nground. At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar\ntone—\n\n“I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your\nchamber door.”\n\n“No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.”\n\n“But you heard an odd laugh? You have heard that laugh before, I should\nthink, or something like it?”\n\n“Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,—she\nlaughs in that way. She is a singular person.”\n\n“Just so. Grace Poole—you have guessed it. She is, as you say,\nsingular—very. Well, I shall reflect on the subject. Meantime, I am\nglad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the\nprecise details of to-night’s incident. You are no talking fool: say\nnothing about it. I will account for this state of affairs” (pointing\nto the bed): “and now return to your own room. I shall do very well on\nthe sofa in the library for the rest of the night. It is near four:—in\ntwo hours the servants will be up.”\n\n“Good-night, then, sir,” said I, departing.\n\nHe seemed surprised—very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to\ngo.\n\n“What!” he exclaimed, “are you quitting me already, and in that way?”\n\n“You said I might go, sir.”\n\n“But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of\nacknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry\nfashion. Why, you have saved my life!—snatched me from a horrible and\nexcruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual\nstrangers! At least shake hands.”\n\nHe held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, then in\nboth his own.\n\n“You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a\ndebt. I cannot say more. Nothing else that has being would have been\ntolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation:\nbut you: it is different;—I feel your benefits no burden, Jane.”\n\nHe paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,—but\nhis voice was checked.\n\n“Good-night again, sir. There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,\nin the case.”\n\n“I knew,” he continued, “you would do me good in some way, at some\ntime;—I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression\nand smile did not”—(again he stopped)—“did not” (he proceeded hastily)\n“strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing. People talk of\nnatural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of\ntruth in the wildest fable. My cherished preserver, good-night!”\n\nStrange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.\n\n“I am glad I happened to be awake,” I said: and then I was going.\n\n“What! you _will_ go?”\n\n“I am cold, sir.”\n\n“Cold? Yes,—and standing in a pool! Go, then, Jane; go!” But he still\nretained my hand, and I could not free it. I bethought myself of an\nexpedient.\n\n“I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir,” said I.\n\n“Well, leave me:” he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.\n\nI regained my couch, but never thought of sleep. Till morning dawned I\nwas tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble\nrolled under surges of joy. I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild\nwaters a shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a\nfreshening gale, wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards\nthe bourne: but I could not reach it, even in fancy—a counteracting\nbreeze blew off land, and continually drove me back. Sense would resist\ndelirium: judgment would warn passion. Too feverish to rest, I rose as\nsoon as day dawned.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nI both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed\nthis sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to\nmeet his eye. During the early part of the morning, I momentarily\nexpected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the\nschoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had\nthe impression that he was sure to visit it that day.\n\nBut the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the\nquiet course of Adèle’s studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard\nsome bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester’s chamber, Mrs.\nFairfax’s voice, and Leah’s, and the cook’s—that is, John’s wife—and\neven John’s own gruff tones. There were exclamations of “What a mercy\nmaster was not burnt in his bed!” “It is always dangerous to keep a\ncandle lit at night.” “How providential that he had presence of mind to\nthink of the water-jug!” “I wonder he waked nobody!” “It is to be hoped\nhe will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,” &c.\n\nTo much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to\nrights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I\nsaw through the open door that all was again restored to complete\norder; only the bed was stripped of its hangings. Leah stood up in the\nwindow-seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke. I was about\nto address her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the\naffair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber—a woman\nsitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.\nThat woman was no other than Grace Poole.\n\nThere she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff\ngown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap. She was intent on\nher work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard\nforehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the\npaleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the\ncountenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended\nvictim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),\ncharged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate. I was\namazed—confounded. She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,\nno increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of\nguilt, or fear of detection. She said “Good morning, Miss,” in her\nusual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more\ntape, went on with her sewing.\n\n“I will put her to some test,” thought I: “such absolute\nimpenetrability is past comprehension.”\n\n“Good morning, Grace,” I said. “Has anything happened here? I thought I\nheard the servants all talking together a while ago.”\n\n“Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep\nwith his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he\nawoke before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to\nquench the flames with the water in the ewer.”\n\n“A strange affair!” I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her\nfixedly—“Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody? Did no one hear him move?”\n\nShe again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of\nconsciousness in their expression. She seemed to examine me warily;\nthen she answered—\n\n“The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be\nlikely to hear. Mrs. Fairfax’s room and yours are the nearest to\nmaster’s; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get\nelderly, they often sleep heavy.” She paused, and then added, with a\nsort of assumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant\ntone—“But you are young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper:\nperhaps you may have heard a noise?”\n\n“I did,” said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still\npolishing the panes, could not hear me, “and at first I thought it was\nPilot: but Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a\nstrange one.”\n\nShe took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her\nneedle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure—\n\n“It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he\nwas in such danger: You must have been dreaming.”\n\n“I was not dreaming,” I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness\nprovoked me. Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and\nconscious eye.\n\n“Have you told master that you heard a laugh?” she inquired.\n\n“I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.”\n\n“You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the\ngallery?” she further asked.\n\nShe appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me\ninformation unawares. The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew\nor suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant\npranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.\n\n“On the contrary,” said I, “I bolted my door.”\n\n“Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before\nyou get into bed?”\n\n“Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans\naccordingly!” Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied\nsharply, “Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not\nthink it necessary. I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be\ndreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future” (and I laid marked stress on\nthe words) “I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture\nto lie down.”\n\n“It will be wise so to do,” was her answer: “this neighbourhood is as\nquiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by\nrobbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds’\nworth of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known. And you see, for\nsuch a large house, there are very few servants, because master has\nnever lived here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he\nneeds little waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe\nside; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt\nbetween one and any mischief that may be about. A deal of people, Miss,\nare for trusting all to Providence; but I say Providence will not\ndispense with the means, though He often blesses them when they are\nused discreetly.” And here she closed her harangue: a long one for her,\nand uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress.\n\nI still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her\nmiraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the\ncook entered.\n\n“Mrs. Poole,” said she, addressing Grace, “the servants’ dinner will\nsoon be ready: will you come down?”\n\n“No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I’ll\ncarry it upstairs.”\n\n“You’ll have some meat?”\n\n“Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that’s all.”\n\n“And the sago?”\n\n“Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I’ll\nmake it myself.”\n\nThe cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for\nme: so I departed.\n\nI hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax’s account of the curtain conflagration\nduring dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the\nenigmatical character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the\nproblem of her position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not\nbeen given into custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed\nfrom her master’s service. He had almost as much as declared his\nconviction of her criminality last night: what mysterious cause\nwithheld him from accusing her? Why had he enjoined me, too, to\nsecrecy? It was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman\nseemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his dependents; so\nmuch in her power, that even when she lifted her hand against his life,\nhe dared not openly charge her with the attempt, much less punish her\nfor it.\n\nHad Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think\nthat tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester\nin her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea\ncould not be admitted. “Yet,” I reflected, “she has been young once;\nher youth would be contemporary with her master’s: Mrs. Fairfax told me\nonce, she had lived here many years. I don’t think she can ever have\nbeen pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and\nstrength of character to compensate for the want of personal\nadvantages. Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric:\nGrace is eccentric at least. What if a former caprice (a freak very\npossible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him\ninto her power, and she now exercises over his actions a secret\ninfluence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake\noff, and dare not disregard?” But, having reached this point of\nconjecture, Mrs. Poole’s square, flat figure, and uncomely, dry, even\ncoarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind’s eye, that I thought,\n“No; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct. Yet,” suggested the\nsecret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, “_you_ are not\nbeautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate,\nyou have often felt as if he did; and last night—remember his words;\nremember his look; remember his voice!”\n\nI well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment\nvividly renewed. I was now in the schoolroom; Adèle was drawing; I bent\nover her and directed her pencil. She looked up with a sort of start.\n\n“Qu’avez-vous, mademoiselle?” said she. “Vos doigts tremblent comme la\nfeuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!”\n\n“I am hot, Adèle, with stooping!” She went on sketching; I went on\nthinking.\n\nI hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been\nconceiving respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me. I compared myself\nwith her, and found we were different. Bessie Leaven had said I was\nquite a lady; and she spoke truth—I was a lady. And now I looked much\nbetter than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh,\nmore life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener\nenjoyments.\n\n“Evening approaches,” said I, as I looked towards the window. “I have\nnever heard Mr. Rochester’s voice or step in the house to-day; but\nsurely I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the\nmorning; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled\nthat it is grown impatient.”\n\nWhen dusk actually closed, and when Adèle left me to go and play in the\nnursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it. I listened for the\nbell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I\nfancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester’s own tread, and I turned to\nthe door, expecting it to open and admit him. The door remained shut;\ndarkness only came in through the window. Still it was not late; he\noften sent for me at seven and eight o’clock, and it was yet but six.\nSurely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many\nthings to say to him! I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace\nPoole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if\nhe really believed it was she who had made last night’s hideous\nattempt; and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret. It little\nmattered whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of\nvexing and soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in,\nand a sure instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the\nverge of provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked\nwell to try my skill. Retaining every minute form of respect, every\npropriety of my station, I could still meet him in argument without\nfear or uneasy restraint; this suited both him and me.\n\nA tread creaked on the stairs at last. Leah made her appearance; but it\nwas only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax’s room. Thither\nI repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I\nimagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester’s presence.\n\n“You must want your tea,” said the good lady, as I joined her; “you ate\nso little at dinner. I am afraid,” she continued, “you are not well\nto-day: you look flushed and feverish.”\n\n“Oh, quite well! I never felt better.”\n\n“Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the\nteapot while I knit off this needle?” Having completed her task, she\nrose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I\nsuppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast\ndeepening into total obscurity.\n\n“It is fair to-night,” said she, as she looked through the panes,\n“though not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a\nfavourable day for his journey.”\n\n“Journey!—Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere? I did not know he was out.”\n\n“Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted! He is gone to the Leas,\nMr. Eshton’s place, ten miles on the other side Millcote. I believe\nthere is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,\nColonel Dent, and others.”\n\n“Do you expect him back to-night?”\n\n“No—nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a\nweek or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they\nare so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all\nthat can please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.\nGentlemen especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr.\nRochester is so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is\na general favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would\nnot think his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in\ntheir eyes: but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his\nwealth and good blood, make amends for any little fault of look.”\n\n“Are there ladies at the Leas?”\n\n“There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters—very elegant young\nladies indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram,\nmost beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or\nseven years since, when she was a girl of eighteen. She came here to a\nChristmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave. You should have seen the\ndining-room that day—how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit\nup! I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present—all of\nthe first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of\nthe evening.”\n\n“You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?”\n\n“Yes, I saw her. The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was\nChristmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to\nhear some of the ladies sing and play. Mr. Rochester would have me to\ncome in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them. I never saw\na more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of\nthem—at least most of the younger ones—looked handsome; but Miss Ingram\nwas certainly the queen.”\n\n“And what was she like?”\n\n“Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive\ncomplexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.\nRochester’s: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels. And then\nshe had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly\narranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the\nglossiest curls I ever saw. She was dressed in pure white; an\namber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her\nbreast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below\nher knee. She wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it\ncontrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls.”\n\n“She was greatly admired, of course?”\n\n“Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.\nShe was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the\npiano. She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet.”\n\n“Mr. Rochester? I was not aware he could sing.”\n\n“Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music.”\n\n“And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?”\n\n“A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to\nlisten to her;—and she played afterwards. I am no judge of music, but\nMr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably\ngood.”\n\n“And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?”\n\n“It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large\nfortunes. Old Lord Ingram’s estates were chiefly entailed, and the\neldest son came in for everything almost.”\n\n“But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to\nher: Mr. Rochester, for instance. He is rich, is he not?”\n\n“Oh! yes. But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.\nRochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five.”\n\n“What of that? More unequal matches are made every day.”\n\n“True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an\nidea of the sort. But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since\nyou began tea.”\n\n“No: I am too thirsty to eat. Will you let me have another cup?”\n\nI was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.\nRochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adèle came in, and the\nconversation was turned into another channel.\n\nWhen once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into\nmy heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring\nback with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination’s\nboundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.\n\nArraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,\nwishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night—of the\ngeneral state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight\npast; Reason having come forward and told, in her own quiet way, a\nplain, unvarnished tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and\nrabidly devoured the ideal;—I pronounced judgment to this effect:—\n\nThat a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of\nlife; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet\nlies, and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.\n\n“_You_,” I said, “a favourite with Mr. Rochester? _You_ gifted with the\npower of pleasing him? _You_ of importance to him in any way? Go! your\nfolly sickens me. And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens\nof preference—equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man\nof the world to a dependent and a novice. How dared you? Poor stupid\ndupe!—Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to\nyourself this morning the brief scene of last night?—Cover your face\nand be ashamed! He said something in praise of your eyes, did he? Blind\npuppy! Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed\nsenselessness! It does good to no woman to be flattered by her\nsuperior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in\nall women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned\nand unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and\nresponded to, must lead, _ignis-fatuus_-like, into miry wilds whence\nthere is no extrication.\n\n“Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass\nbefore you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without\nsoftening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing\nirregularity; write under it, ‘Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,\npoor, and plain.’\n\n“Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory—you have one prepared in your\ndrawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest\ntints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate\ncarefully the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest\nshades and sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs.\nFairfax of Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental\neye;—What! you revert to Mr. Rochester as a model! Order! No snivel!—no\nsentiment!—no regret! I will endure only sense and resolution. Recall\nthe august yet harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let\nthe round and dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit\nneither diamond ring nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire,\naërial lace and glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call\nit ‘Blanche, an accomplished lady of rank.’\n\n“Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks\nwell of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, ‘Mr.\nRochester might probably win that noble lady’s love, if he chose to\nstrive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this\nindigent and insignificant plebeian?’”\n\n“I’ll do it,” I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew\ncalm, and fell asleep.\n\nI kept my word. An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in\ncrayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory\nminiature of an imaginary Blanche Ingram. It looked a lovely face\nenough, and when compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was\nas great as self-control could desire. I derived benefit from the task:\nit had kept my head and hands employed, and had given force and\nfixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my\nheart.\n\nEre long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of\nwholesome discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.\nThanks to it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent\ncalm, which, had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been\nunequal to maintain, even externally.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nA week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and\nstill he did not come. Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if\nhe were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the\nContinent, and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to\ncome; he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt\nand unexpected. When I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange\nchill and failing at the heart. I was actually permitting myself to\nexperience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits,\nand recollecting my principles, I at once called my sensations to\norder; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder—how I\ncleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester’s movements a matter\nin which I had any cause to take a vital interest. Not that I humbled\nmyself by a slavish notion of inferiority: on the contrary, I just\nsaid—\n\n“You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to\nreceive the salary he gives you for teaching his protégée, and to be\ngrateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your\nduty, you have a right to expect at his hands. Be sure that is the only\ntie he seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don’t make him\nthe object of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.\nHe is not of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting\nto lavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a\ngift is not wanted and would be despised.”\n\nI went on with my day’s business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague\nsuggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit\nThornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and\npondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not\nthink to check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.\n\nMr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post\nbrought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.\n\n“It is from the master,” said she, as she looked at the direction. “Now\nI suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not.”\n\nAnd while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking\nmy coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that\ncircumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face. Why my hand\nshook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into\nmy saucer, I did not choose to consider.\n\n“Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being\nbusy enough now: for a little while at least,” said Mrs. Fairfax, still\nholding the note before her spectacles.\n\nEre I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of\nAdèle’s pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to\nanother bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly—\n\n“Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?”\n\n“Indeed he is—in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and\nnot alone either. I don’t know how many of the fine people at the Leas\nare coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to\nbe prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I\nam to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from\nwherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the\ngentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it.” And Mrs.\nFairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence\noperations.\n\nThe three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough. I had thought\nall the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it\nappears I was mistaken. Three women were got to help; and such\nscrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,\nsuch taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors\nand lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets\nand feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.\nAdèle ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company\nand the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.\nShe would have Sophie to look over all her “toilettes,” as she called\nfrocks; to furbish up any that were “_passées_,” and to air and arrange\nthe new. For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front\nchambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and\npiled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the\nchimneys. From school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had\npressed me into her service, and I was all day in the storeroom,\nhelping (or hindering) her and the cook; learning to make custards and\ncheese-cakes and French pastry, to truss game and garnish\ndesert-dishes.\n\nThe party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for\ndinner at six. During the intervening period I had no time to nurse\nchimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody—Adèle\nexcepted. Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my\ncheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of\ndoubts and portents, and dark conjectures. This was when I chanced to\nsee the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept\nlocked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in\nprim cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along\nthe gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her\nlook into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,—just say a word, perhaps,\nto the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a\nmarble mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass\non. She would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner,\nsmoke a moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of\nporter with her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper\nhaunt. Only one hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her\nfellow-servants below; all the rest of her time was spent in some\nlow-ceiled, oaken chamber of the second storey: there she sat and\nsewed—and probably laughed drearily to herself,—as companionless as a\nprisoner in his dungeon.\n\nThe strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except\nme, noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed\nher position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation. I\nonce, indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the\ncharwomen, of which Grace formed the subject. Leah had been saying\nsomething I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked—\n\n“She gets good wages, I guess?”\n\n“Yes,” said Leah; “I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain\nof,—there’s no stinginess at Thornfield; but they’re not one fifth of\nthe sum Mrs. Poole receives. And she is laying by: she goes every\nquarter to the bank at Millcote. I should not wonder but she has saved\nenough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose\nshe’s got used to the place; and then she’s not forty yet, and strong\nand able for anything. It is too soon for her to give up business.”\n\n“She is a good hand, I daresay,” said the charwoman.\n\n“Ah!—she understands what she has to do,—nobody better,” rejoined Leah\nsignificantly; “and it is not every one could fill her shoes—not for\nall the money she gets.”\n\n“That it is not!” was the reply. “I wonder whether the master—”\n\nThe charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and\nshe instantly gave her companion a nudge.\n\n“Doesn’t she know?” I heard the woman whisper.\n\nLeah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped. All I\nhad gathered from it amounted to this,—that there was a mystery at\nThornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely\nexcluded.\n\nThursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening;\ncarpets were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white\ncounterpanes spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers\npiled in vases: both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as\nhands could make them. The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved\nclock, as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase, were\npolished to the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard\nflashed resplendent with plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases\nof exotics bloomed on all sides.\n\nAfternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her\ngloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the\ncompany,—to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c. Adèle, too, would be\ndressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to\nthe party that day at least. However, to please her, I allowed Sophie\nto apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks. For myself, I\nhad no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my\nsanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,—“a\nvery pleasant refuge in time of trouble.”\n\nIt had been a mild, serene spring day—one of those days which, towards\nthe end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth\nas heralds of summer. It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was\neven warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.\n\n“It gets late,” said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state. “I am\nglad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned;\nfor it is past six now. I have sent John down to the gates to see if\nthere is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in\nthe direction of Millcote.” She went to the window. “Here he is!” said\nshe. “Well, John” (leaning out), “any news?”\n\n“They’re coming, ma’am,” was the answer. “They’ll be here in ten\nminutes.”\n\nAdèle flew to the window. I followed, taking care to stand on one side,\nso that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.\n\nThe ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels\nwere heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came\ntwo open carriages. Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the\nvehicles; two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen;\nthe third was Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot\nbounding before him; at his side rode a lady, and he and she were the\nfirst of the party. Her purple riding-habit almost swept the ground,\nher veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with its transparent\nfolds, and gleaming through them, shone rich raven ringlets.\n\n“Miss Ingram!” exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post\nbelow.\n\nThe cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the\nangle of the house, and I lost sight of it. Adèle now petitioned to go\ndown; but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she\nmust not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies,\neither now or at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr.\nRochester would be very angry, &c. “Some natural tears she shed” on\nbeing told this; but as I began to look very grave, she consented at\nlast to wipe them.\n\nA joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen’s deep tones and\nladies’ silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and\ndistinguishable above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of\nthe master of Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests\nunder its roof. Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a\ntripping through the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and\nclosing doors, and, for a time, a hush.\n\n“Elles changent de toilettes,” said Adèle; who, listening attentively,\nhad followed every movement; and she sighed.\n\n“Chez maman,” said she, “quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais\npartout, au salon et à leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes\nde chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c’était si amusant: comme\ncela on apprend.”\n\n“Don’t you feel hungry, Adèle?”\n\n“Mais oui, mademoiselle: voilà cinq ou six heures que nous n’avons pas\nmangé.”\n\n“Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and\nget you something to eat.”\n\nAnd issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs\nwhich conducted directly to the kitchen. All in that region was fire\nand commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection,\nand the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body\nthreatening spontaneous combustion. In the servants’ hall two coachmen\nand three gentlemen’s gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the\nabigails, I suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new\nservants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling about\neverywhere. Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I\ntook possession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate\nor two and a knife and fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat. I\nhad regained the gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind\nme, when an accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to\nissue from their chambers. I could not proceed to the schoolroom\nwithout passing some of their doors, and running the risk of being\nsurprised with my cargo of victualage; so I stood still at this end,\nwhich, being windowless, was dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set\nand twilight gathering.\n\nPresently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another:\neach came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous\nthrough the dusk. For a moment they stood grouped together at the other\nextremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued\nvivacity: they then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a\nbright mist rolls down a hill. Their collective appearance had left on\nme an impression of high-born elegance, such as I had never before\nreceived.\n\nI found Adèle peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.\n“What beautiful ladies!” cried she in English. “Oh, I wish I might go\nto them! Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after\ndinner?”\n\n“No, indeed, I don’t; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.\nNever mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow:\nhere is your dinner.”\n\nShe was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her\nattention for a time. It was well I secured this forage, or both she,\nI, and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run\na chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much\nengaged to think of us. The dessert was not carried out till after\nnine; and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and\ncoffee-cups. I allowed Adèle to sit up much later than usual; for she\ndeclared she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept\nopening and shutting below, and people bustling about. Besides, she\nadded, a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was\nundressed; “et alors quel dommage!”\n\nI told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a\nchange I took her out into the gallery. The hall lamp was now lit, and\nit amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants\npassing backwards and forwards. When the evening was far advanced, a\nsound of music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been\nremoved; Adèle and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.\nPresently a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a\nlady who sang, and very sweet her notes were. The solo over, a duet\nfollowed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the\nintervals. I listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was\nwholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to\ndiscriminate amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester;\nand when it caught them, which it soon did, it found a further task in\nframing the tones, rendered by distance inarticulate, into words.\n\nThe clock struck eleven. I looked at Adèle, whose head leant against my\nshoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and\ncarried her off to bed. It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies\nsought their chambers.\n\nThe next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the\nparty to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood. They set out\nearly in the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I\nwitnessed both the departure and the return. Miss Ingram, as before,\nwas the only lady equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at\nher side; the two rode a little apart from the rest. I pointed out this\ncircumstance to Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me—\n\n“You said it was not likely they should think of being married,” said\nI, “but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other\nladies.”\n\n“Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her.”\n\n“And she him,” I added; “look how she leans her head towards him as if\nshe were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have\nnever had a glimpse of it yet.”\n\n“You will see her this evening,” answered Mrs. Fairfax. “I happened to\nremark to Mr. Rochester how much Adèle wished to be introduced to the\nladies, and he said: ‘Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after\ndinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.’”\n\n“Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure,” I\nanswered.\n\n“Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not\nthink you would like appearing before so gay a party—all strangers; and\nhe replied, in his quick way—‘Nonsense! If she objects, tell her it is\nmy particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her\nin case of contumacy.’”\n\n“I will not give him that trouble,” I answered. “I will go, if no\nbetter may be; but I don’t like it. Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?”\n\n“No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea. I’ll tell you how to\nmanage so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance,\nwhich is the most disagreeable part of the business. You must go into\nthe drawing-room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the\ndinner-table; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not\nstay long after the gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr.\nRochester see you are there and then slip away—nobody will notice you.”\n\n“Will these people remain long, do you think?”\n\n“Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more. After the Easter\nrecess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote,\nwill have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester\nwill accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so\nprotracted a stay at Thornfield.”\n\nIt was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I\nwas to repair with my charge to the drawing-room. Adèle had been in a\nstate of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the\nladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the\noperation of dressing her that she sobered down. Then the importance of\nthe process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls\narranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put\non, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as\ngrave as any judge. No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire:\nwhen she was dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking\ncare previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease\nit, and assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready. This I\nquickly was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss\nTemple’s wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was\nsoon smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed. We\ndescended.\n\nFortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that\nthrough the saloon where they were all seated at dinner. We found the\napartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth,\nand wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers\nwith which the tables were adorned. The crimson curtain hung before the\narch: slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party\nin the adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of\ntheir conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.\n\nAdèle, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most\nsolemnising impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I\npointed out to her. I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from\na table near, endeavoured to read. Adèle brought her stool to my feet;\nere long she touched my knee.\n\n“What is it, Adèle?”\n\n“Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendre une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,\nmademoiselle? Seulement pour completer ma toilette.”\n\n“You think too much of your ‘toilette,’ Adèle: but you may have a\nflower.” And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash. She\nsighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness\nwere now full. I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not\nsuppress: there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the\nlittle Parisienne’s earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.\n\nA soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back\nfrom the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre\npouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent\ndessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the\nopening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.\n\nThere were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the\nimpression of a much larger number. Some of them were very tall; many\nwere dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that\nseemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon. I rose\nand curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the\nothers only stared at me.\n\nThey dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and\nbuoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds. Some of\nthem threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and\nottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:\nthe rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but\nclear tone which seemed habitual to them. I knew their names\nafterwards, and may as well mention them now.\n\nFirst, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters. She had\nevidently been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still. Of her\ndaughters, the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naïve, and child-like in\nface and manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue\nsash became her well. The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant\nin figure; with a very pretty face, of that order the French term\n_minois chiffoné_: both sisters were fair as lilies.\n\nLady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,\nvery haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful\nsheen: her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume,\nand within the circlet of a band of gems.\n\nMrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like. She\nhad a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair. Her black\nsatin dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments,\npleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.\n\nBut the three most distinguished—partly, perhaps, because the tallest\nfigures of the band—were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,\nBlanche and Mary. They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.\nThe Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;\nher hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were\nstill apparently perfect. Most people would have termed her a splendid\nwoman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but\nthen there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her\nbearing and countenance. She had Roman features and a double chin,\ndisappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me\nnot only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the\nchin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost\npreternatural erectness. She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it\nreminded me of Mrs. Reed’s; she mouthed her words in speaking; her\nvoice was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,—very\nintolerable, in short. A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of\nsome gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought)\nwith a truly imperial dignity.\n\nBlanche and Mary were of equal stature,—straight and tall as poplars.\nMary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.\nI regarded her, of course, with special interest. First, I wished to\nsee whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax’s description;\nsecondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted\nof her; and thirdly—it will out!—whether it were such as I should fancy\nlikely to suit Mr. Rochester’s taste.\n\nAs far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture\nand Mrs. Fairfax’s description. The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,\nthe graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;—but\nher face? Her face was like her mother’s; a youthful unfurrowed\nlikeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride. It\nwas not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her\nlaugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched\nand haughty lip.\n\nGenius is said to be self-conscious. I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram\nwas a genius, but she was self-conscious—remarkably self-conscious\nindeed. She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.\nDent. It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she\nsaid, she liked flowers, “especially wild ones;” Miss Ingram had, and\nshe ran over its vocabulary with an air. I presently perceived she was\n(what is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on\nher ignorance; her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not\ngood-natured. She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her\nvoice was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it\nwell, with fluency and with a good accent.\n\nMary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer\nfeatures too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a\nSpaniard)—but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,\nher eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,\nremained fixed like a statue in its niche. The sisters were both\nattired in spotless white.\n\nAnd did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be\nlikely to make? I could not tell—I did not know his taste in female\nbeauty. If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty:\nthen she was accomplished, sprightly. Most gentlemen would admire her,\nI thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have\nobtained proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to\nsee them together.\n\nYou are not to suppose, reader, that Adèle has all this time been\nsitting motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies\nentered, she rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and\nsaid with gravity—\n\n“Bon jour, mesdames.”\n\nAnd Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and\nexclaimed, “Oh, what a little puppet!”\n\nLady Lynn had remarked, “It is Mr. Rochester’s ward, I suppose—the\nlittle French girl he was speaking of.”\n\nMrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss. Amy and\nLouisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously—\n\n“What a love of a child!”\n\nAnd then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced\nbetween them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;\nabsorbing not only the young ladies’ attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton\nand Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart’s content.\n\nAt last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned. I sit in\nthe shade—if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the\nwindow-curtain half hides me. Again the arch yawns; they come. The\ncollective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is\nvery imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall,\nsome young. Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed;\nand Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man. Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of\nthe district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows\nand whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of\na “père noble de théâtre.” Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;\nlike them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary’s apathetic and\nlistless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of\nblood or vigour of brain.\n\nAnd where is Mr. Rochester?\n\nHe comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter. I\ntry to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes\nof the purse I am forming—I wish to think only of the work I have in my\nhands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my\nlap; whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall\nthe moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he\ndeemed, an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down\non my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager\nto overflow; in whose emotions I had a part. How near had I approached\nhim at that moment! What had occurred since, calculated to change his\nand my relative positions? Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we\nwere! So far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to\nme. I did not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at\nthe other side of the room, and began conversing with some of the\nladies.\n\nNo sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I\nmight gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn\ninvoluntarily to his face; I could not keep their lids under control:\nthey would rise, and the irids would fix on him. I looked, and had an\nacute pleasure in looking,—a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold,\nwith a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing\nman might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned,\nyet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless.\n\nMost true is it that “beauty is in the eye of the gazer.” My master’s\ncolourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,\ndeep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,—all energy, decision,\nwill,—were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than\nbeautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite\nmastered me,—that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them\nin his. I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought\nhard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and\nnow, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived,\ngreen and strong! He made me love him without looking at me.\n\nI compared him with his guests. What was the gallant grace of the\nLynns, the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,—even the military\ndistinction of Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith\nand genuine power? I had no sympathy in their appearance, their\nexpression: yet I could imagine that most observers would call them\nattractive, handsome, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr.\nRochester at once harsh-featured and melancholy-looking. I saw them\nsmile, laugh—it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much soul\nin it as their smile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance as\ntheir laugh. I saw Mr. Rochester smile:—his stern features softened;\nhis eye grew both brilliant and gentle, its ray both searching and\nsweet. He was talking, at the moment, to Louisa and Amy Eshton. I\nwondered to see them receive with calm that look which seemed to me so\npenetrating: I expected their eyes to fall, their colour to rise under\nit; yet I was glad when I found they were in no sense moved. “He is not\nto them what he is to me,” I thought: “he is not of their kind. I\nbelieve he is of mine;—I am sure he is—I feel akin to him—I understand\nthe language of his countenance and movements: though rank and wealth\nsever us widely, I have something in my brain and heart, in my blood\nand nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him. Did I say, a few days\nsince, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at\nhis hands? Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other light than\nas a paymaster? Blasphemy against nature! Every good, true, vigorous\nfeeling I have gathers impulsively round him. I know I must conceal my\nsentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he cannot care\nmuch for me. For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I\nhave his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean only that\nI have certain tastes and feelings in common with him. I must, then,\nrepeat continually that we are for ever sundered:—and yet, while I\nbreathe and think, I must love him.”\n\nCoffee is handed. The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become\nlively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry. Colonel Dent and\nMr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen. The two proud\ndowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together. Sir\nGeorge—whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,—a very big, and\nvery fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa,\ncoffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word. Mr. Frederick Lynn\nhas taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings\nof a splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently\nsays little. The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms\non the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up\nat him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does\nMr. Rochester. Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the\nfeet of Louisa: Adèle shares it with him: he is trying to talk French\nwith her, and Louisa laughs at his blunders. With whom will Blanche\nIngram pair? She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully\nover an album. She seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait\ntoo long: she herself selects a mate.\n\nMr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as\nsolitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her\nstation on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?”\n\n“Nor am I.”\n\n“Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?”\n(pointing to Adèle). “Where did you pick her up?”\n\n“I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands.”\n\n“You should have sent her to school.”\n\n“I could not afford it: schools are so dear.”\n\n“Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her\njust now—is she gone? Oh, no! there she is still, behind the\nwindow-curtain. You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as\nexpensive,—more so; for you have them both to keep in addition.”\n\nI feared—or should I say, hoped?—the allusion to me would make Mr.\nRochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the\nshade: but he never turned his eyes.\n\n“I have not considered the subject,” said he indifferently, looking\nstraight before him.\n\n“No, you men never do consider economy and common sense. You should\nhear mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should\nthink, a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the\nrest ridiculous, and all incubi—were they not, mama?”\n\n“Did you speak, my own?”\n\nThe young lady thus claimed as the dowager’s special property,\nreiterated her question with an explanation.\n\n“My dearest, don’t mention governesses; the word makes me nervous. I\nhave suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice. I thank\nHeaven I have now done with them!”\n\nMrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in\nher ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that\none of the anathematised race was present.\n\n“Tant pis!” said her Ladyship, “I hope it may do her good!” Then, in a\nlower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, “I noticed her; I am\na judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class.”\n\n“What are they, madam?” inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.\n\n“I will tell you in your private ear,” replied she, wagging her turban\nthree times with portentous significancy.\n\n“But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now.”\n\n“Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I.”\n\n“Oh, don’t refer him to me, mama! I have just one word to say of the\nwhole tribe; they are a nuisance. Not that I ever suffered much from\nthem; I took care to turn the tables. What tricks Theodore and I used\nto play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts! Mary\nwas always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit. The best fun was\nwith Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose\nand low-spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and\nMrs. Grey was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her. But\npoor Madame Joubert! I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had\ndriven her to extremities—spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter,\ntossed our books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the\nruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons. Theodore, do you remember\nthose merry days?”\n\n“Yaas, to be sure I do,” drawled Lord Ingram; “and the poor old stick\nused to cry out ‘Oh you villains childs!’—and then we sermonised her on\nthe presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,\nwhen she was herself so ignorant.”\n\n“We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or\npersecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining—the parson in the pip,\nas we used to call him. He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling\nin love with each other—at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised\nsundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of ‘la\nbelle passion,’ and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of\nour discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our\ndead-weights from the house. Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an\ninkling of the business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.\nDid you not, my lady-mother?”\n\n“Certainly, my best. And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a\nthousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should\nnever be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly—”\n\n“Oh, gracious, mama! Spare us the enumeration! _Au reste_, we all know\nthem: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and\nconsequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached—mutual alliance\nand reliance; confidence thence resulting—insolence accompanying—mutiny\nand general blow-up. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?”\n\n“My lily-flower, you are right now, as always.”\n\n“Then no more need be said: change the subject.”\n\nAmy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her\nsoft, infantine tone: “Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but\nshe was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her\nout. She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?”\n\n“No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her\nworkbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,\nshe would give us anything we asked for.”\n\n“I suppose, now,” said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, “we\nshall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in\norder to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a\nnew topic. Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?”\n\n“Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other.”\n\n“Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward. Signior Eduardo, are\nyou in voice to-night?”\n\n“Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be.”\n\n“Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your\nlungs and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal\nservice.”\n\n“Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?”\n\n“A fig for Rizzio!” cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as\nshe moved to the piano. “It is my opinion the fiddler David must have\nbeen an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my\nmind a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history\nmay say what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just\nthe sort of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to\ngift with my hand.”\n\n“Gentlemen, you hear! Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?” cried\nMr. Rochester.\n\n“I should say the preference lies with you,” responded Colonel Dent.\n\n“On my honour, I am much obliged to you,” was the reply.\n\nMiss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,\nspreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a\nbrilliant prelude; talking meantime. She appeared to be on her high\nhorse to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite\nnot only the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was\nevidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring\nindeed.\n\n“Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!” exclaimed she,\nrattling away at the instrument. “Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a\nstep beyond papa’s park gates: nor to go even so far without mama’s\npermission and guardianship! Creatures so absorbed in care about their\npretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man\nhad anything to do with beauty! As if loveliness were not the special\nprerogative of woman—her legitimate appanage and heritage! I grant an\nugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the\n_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and\nvalour: let their motto be:—Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not\nworth a fillip. Such should be my device, were I a man.”\n\n“Whenever I marry,” she continued after a pause which none interrupted,\n“I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me. I\nwill suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided\nhomage: his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he\nsees in his mirror. Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you.”\n\n“I am all obedience,” was the response.\n\n“Here then is a Corsair-song. Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for\nthat reason, sing it _con spirito_.”\n\n“Commands from Miss Ingram’s lips would put spirit into a mug of milk\nand water.”\n\n“Take care, then: if you don’t please me, I will shame you by showing\nhow such things _should_ be done.”\n\n“That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to\nfail.”\n\n“Gardez-vous en bien! If you err wilfully, I shall devise a\nproportionate punishment.”\n\n“Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to\ninflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance.”\n\n“Ha! explain!” commanded the lady.\n\n“Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must\ninform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for\ncapital punishment.”\n\n“Sing!” said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an\naccompaniment in spirited style.\n\n“Now is my time to slip away,” thought I: but the tones that then\nsevered the air arrested me. Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester\npossessed a fine voice: he did—a mellow, powerful bass, into which he\nthrew his own feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to\nthe heart, and there waking sensation strangely. I waited till the last\ndeep and full vibration had expired—till the tide of talk, checked an\ninstant, had resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and\nmade my exit by the side-door, which was fortunately near. Thence a\nnarrow passage led into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal\nwas loose; I stopped to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the\nmat at the foot of the staircase. I heard the dining-room door unclose;\na gentleman came out; rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it\nwas Mr. Rochester.\n\n“How do you do?” he asked.\n\n“I am very well, sir.”\n\n“Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?”\n\nI thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I\nwould not take that freedom. I answered—\n\n“I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir.”\n\n“What have you been doing during my absence?”\n\n“Nothing particular; teaching Adèle as usual.”\n\n“And getting a good deal paler than you were—as I saw at first sight.\nWhat is the matter?”\n\n“Nothing at all, sir.”\n\n“Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?”\n\n“Not the least.”\n\n“Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early.”\n\n“I am tired, sir.”\n\nHe looked at me for a minute.\n\n“And a little depressed,” he said. “What about? Tell me.”\n\n“Nothing—nothing, sir. I am not depressed.”\n\n“But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words\nwould bring tears to your eyes—indeed, they are there now, shining and\nswimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the\nflag. If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig\nof a servant passing, I would know what all this means. Well, to-night\nI excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect\nyou to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don’t\nneglect it. Now go, and send Sophie for Adèle. Good-night, my—” He\nstopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nMerry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how\ndifferent from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and\nsolitude I had passed beneath its roof! All sad feelings seemed now\ndriven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was\nlife everywhere, movement all day long. You could not now traverse the\ngallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so\ntenantless, without encountering a smart lady’s-maid or a dandy valet.\n\nThe kitchen, the butler’s pantry, the servants’ hall, the entrance\nhall, were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still\nwhen the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather\ncalled their occupants out into the grounds. Even when that weather was\nbroken, and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast\nover enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied,\nin consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.\n\nI wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of\nentertainment was proposed: they spoke of “playing charades,” but in my\nignorance I did not understand the term. The servants were called in,\nthe dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the\nchairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch. While Mr. Rochester\nand the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were\nrunning up and down stairs ringing for their maids. Mrs. Fairfax was\nsummoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in\nshawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the\nthird storey were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of\nbrocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace\nlappets, &c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails; then a\nselection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the\nboudoir within the drawing-room.\n\nMeantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and\nwas selecting certain of their number to be of his party. “Miss Ingram\nis mine, of course,” said he: afterwards he named the two Misses\nEshton, and Mrs. Dent. He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I\nhad been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent’s bracelet, which had got\nloose.\n\n“Will you play?” he asked. I shook my head. He did not insist, which I\nrather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my\nusual seat.\n\nHe and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which\nwas headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs. One of\nthe gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I\nshould be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the\nnotion.\n\n“No,” I heard her say: “she looks too stupid for any game of the sort.”\n\nEre long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up. Within the arch, the\nbulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise\nchosen, was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table,\nlay open a large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr.\nRochester’s cloak, and holding a book in her hand. Somebody, unseen,\nrang the bell merrily; then Adèle (who had insisted on being one of her\nguardian’s party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents\nof a basket of flowers she carried on her arm. Then appeared the\nmagnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her\nhead, and a wreath of roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr.\nRochester, and together they drew near the table. They knelt; while\nMrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up their\nstations behind them. A ceremony followed, in dumb show, in which it\nwas easy to recognise the pantomime of a marriage. At its termination,\nColonel Dent and his party consulted in whispers for two minutes, then\nthe Colonel called out—\n\n“Bride!” Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.\n\nA considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its second rising\ndisplayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last. The\ndrawing-room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the\ndining-room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two\nback within the room, appeared a large marble basin, which I recognised\nas an ornament of the conservatory—where it usually stood, surrounded\nby exotics, and tenanted by gold fish—and whence it must have been\ntransported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.\n\nSeated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr.\nRochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head. His dark eyes\nand swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he\nlooked the very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the\nbowstring. Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram. She, too, was\nattired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the\nwaist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her\nbeautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of\nsupporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head. Both her cast of\nform and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the\nidea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was\ndoubtless the character she intended to represent.\n\nShe approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher;\nshe again lifted it to her head. The personage on the well-brink now\nseemed to accost her; to make some request:—“She hasted, let down her\npitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.” From the bosom of his robe\nhe then produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets\nand earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid\nthe treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her\nlooks and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and\nthe rings in her ears. It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were\nwanting.\n\nThe divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they\ncould not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.\nColonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded “the tableau of the whole;”\nwhereupon the curtain again descended.\n\nOn its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed;\nthe rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and\ncoarse drapery. The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a\ndeal table and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very\ndim light proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all\nextinguished.\n\nAmidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on\nhis knees, and his eyes bent on the ground. I knew Mr. Rochester;\nthough the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose\nfrom one arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a\nscuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling\nhair might well have disguised him. As he moved, a chain clanked; to\nhis wrists were attached fetters.\n\n“Bridewell!” exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.\n\nA sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their\nordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room. Mr. Rochester led in\nMiss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.\n\n“Do you know,” said she, “that, of the three characters, I liked you in\nthe last best? Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a\ngallant gentleman-highwayman you would have made!”\n\n“Is all the soot washed from my face?” he asked, turning it towards\nher.\n\n“Alas! yes: the more’s the pity! Nothing could be more becoming to your\ncomplexion than that ruffian’s rouge.”\n\n“You would like a hero of the road then?”\n\n“An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian\nbandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate.”\n\n“Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour\nsince, in the presence of all these witnesses.” She giggled, and her\ncolour rose.\n\n“Now, Dent,” continued Mr. Rochester, “it is your turn.” And as the\nother party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats. Miss\nIngram placed herself at her leader’s right hand; the other diviners\nfilled the chairs on each side of him and her. I did not now watch the\nactors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my\nattention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on\nthe arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.\nWhat charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose,\nhow they acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see\nthe consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to\nMiss Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards\nhim, till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against\nhis cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged\nglances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle\nreturns in memory at this moment.\n\nI have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I\ncould not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to\nnotice me—because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would\nnever once turn his eyes in my direction—because I saw all his\nattentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with\nthe hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious\neye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object\ntoo mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him, because I felt\nsure he would soon marry this very lady—because I read daily in her a\nproud security in his intentions respecting her—because I witnessed\nhourly in him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing\nrather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness,\ncaptivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.\n\nThere was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though\nmuch to create despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to engender\njealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a\nwoman in Miss Ingram’s. But I was not jealous: or very rarely;—the\nnature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss\nIngram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the\nfeeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say. She was very\nshowy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant\nattainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing\nbloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted\nby its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: she used to\nrepeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an\nopinion of her own. She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did\nnot know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were\nnot in her. Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to\na spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adèle: pushing\nher away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach\nher; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with\ncoldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these\nmanifestations of character—watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.\nYes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his\nintended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity—this\nguardedness of his—this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one’s\ndefects—this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her,\nthat my ever-torturing pain arose.\n\nI saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,\nbecause her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given\nher his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from\nhim that treasure. This was the point—this was where the nerve was\ntouched and teased—this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she\ncould not charm him_.\n\nIf she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and\nsincerely laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face,\nturned to the wall, and (figuratively) have died to them. If Miss\nIngram had been a good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour,\nkindness, sense, I should have had one vital struggle with two\ntigers—jealousy and despair: then, my heart torn out and devoured, I\nshould have admired her—acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for\nthe rest of my days: and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper\nwould have been my admiration—the more truly tranquil my quiescence.\nBut as matters really stood, to watch Miss Ingram’s efforts at\nfascinating Mr. Rochester, to witness their repeated failure—herself\nunconscious that they did fail; vainly fancying that each shaft\nlaunched hit the mark, and infatuatedly pluming herself on success,\nwhen her pride and self-complacency repelled further and further what\nshe wished to allure—to witness _this_, was to be at once under\nceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.\n\nBecause, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded. Arrows\nthat continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester’s breast and fell\nharmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have\nquivered keen in his proud heart—have called love into his stern eye,\nand softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons\na silent conquest might have been won.\n\n“Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so\nnear to him?” I asked myself. “Surely she cannot truly like him, or not\nlike him with true affection! If she did, she need not coin her smiles\nso lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so\nelaborate, graces so multitudinous. It seems to me that she might, by\nmerely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get\nnigher his heart. I have seen in his face a far different expression\nfrom that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting\nhim; but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious\narts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it—to answer\nwhat he asked without pretension, to address him when needful without\ngrimace—and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed\none like a fostering sunbeam. How will she manage to please him when\nthey are married? I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might\nbe managed; and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest\nwoman the sun shines on.”\n\nI have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester’s project of\nmarrying for interest and connections. It surprised me when I first\ndiscovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man\nunlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a\nwife; but the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the\nparties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or\nMiss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled\ninto them, doubtless, from their childhood. All their class held these\nprinciples: I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as\nI could not fathom. It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him,\nI would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very\nobviousness of the advantages to the husband’s own happiness offered by\nthis plan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general\nadoption of which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the\nworld would act as I wished to act.\n\nBut in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my\nmaster: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a\nsharp look-out. It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of\nhis character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just\nweighing of both, to form an equitable judgment. Now I saw no bad. The\nsarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once,\nwere only like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was\npungent, but their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid. And\nas for the vague something—was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a\ndesigning or a desponding expression?—that opened upon a careful\nobserver, now and then, in his eye, and closed again before one could\nfathom the strange depth partially disclosed; that something which used\nto make me fear and shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst\nvolcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly felt the ground quiver and\nseen it gape: that something, I, at intervals, beheld still; and with\nthrobbing heart, but not with palsied nerves. Instead of wishing to\nshun, I longed only to dare—to divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram\nhappy, because one day she might look into the abyss at her leisure,\nexplore its secrets and analyse their nature.\n\nMeantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride—saw\nonly them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their\nmovements of importance—the rest of the party were occupied with their\nown separate interests and pleasures. The Ladies Lynn and Ingram\ncontinued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two\nturbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting\ngestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on\nwhich their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets. Mild Mrs.\nDent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes\nbestowed a courteous word or smile on me. Sir George Lynn, Colonel\nDent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice\nbusiness. Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang\nto and with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly\nto the gallant speeches of the other. Sometimes all, as with one\nconsent, suspended their by-play to observe and listen to the principal\nactors: for, after all, Mr. Rochester and—because closely connected\nwith him—Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party. If he was\nabsent from the room an hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal\nover the spirits of his guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a\nfresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation.\n\nThe want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one\nday that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not\nlikely to return till late. The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had\nproposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond\nHay, was consequently deferred. Some of the gentlemen were gone to the\nstables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were\nplaying billiards in the billiard-room. The dowagers Ingram and Lynn\nsought solace in a quiet game at cards. Blanche Ingram, after having\nrepelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and\nMrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some\nsentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a\nnovel from the library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a\nsofa, and prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious\nhours of absence. The room and the house were silent: only now and then\nthe merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.\n\nIt was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the\nhour to dress for dinner, when little Adèle, who knelt by me in the\ndrawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed—\n\n“Voilà Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!”\n\nI turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others,\ntoo, looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a\ncrunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible\non the wet gravel. A post-chaise was approaching.\n\n“What can possess him to come home in that style?” said Miss Ingram.\n“He rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and\nPilot was with him:—what has he done with the animals?”\n\nAs she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so\nnear the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking\nof my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when\nshe did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement. The\npost-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman\nalighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it\nwas a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.\n\n“How provoking!” exclaimed Miss Ingram: “you tiresome monkey!”\n(apostrophising Adèle), “who perched you up in the window to give false\nintelligence?” and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in\nfault.\n\nSome parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.\nHe bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.\n\n“It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,” said he, “when my\nfriend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long\njourney, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate\nacquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns.”\n\nHis manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being\nsomewhat unusual,—not precisely foreign, but still not altogether\nEnglish: his age might be about Mr. Rochester’s,—between thirty and\nforty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a\nfine-looking man, at first sight especially. On closer examination, you\ndetected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed\nto please. His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was\nlarge and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant\nlife—at least so I thought.\n\nThe sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. It was not till\nafter dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.\nBut I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as\nbeing at the same time unsettled and inanimate. His eye wandered, and\nhad no meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I\nnever remembered to have seen. For a handsome and not an\nunamiable-looking man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power\nin that smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that\naquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low,\neven forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.\n\nAs I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the\ngirandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him—for he occupied an\narm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as\nif he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester. I think (with\ndeference be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between\na sleek gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the\nrough-coated keen-eyed dog, its guardian.\n\nHe had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend. A curious friendship\ntheirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage\nthat “extremes meet.”\n\nTwo or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times\nscraps of their conversation across the room. At first I could not make\nmuch sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary\nIngram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that\nreached me at intervals. These last were discussing the stranger; they\nboth called him “a beautiful man.” Louisa said he was “a love of a\ncreature,” and she “adored him;” and Mary instanced his “pretty little\nmouth, and nice nose,” as her ideal of the charming.\n\n“And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!” cried Louisa,—“so\nsmooth—none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and\nsuch a placid eye and smile!”\n\nAnd then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other\nside of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to\nHay Common.\n\nI was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire,\nand I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then\nI learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came\nfrom some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so\nsallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the\nhouse. Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated\nthe West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I\ngathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted\nwith Mr. Rochester. He spoke of his friend’s dislike of the burning\nheats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region. I knew Mr.\nRochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought\nthe continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had\nnever heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.\n\nI was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat\nunexpected one, broke the thread of my musings. Mr. Mason, shivering as\nsome one chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the\nfire, which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still\nshone hot and red. The footman who brought the coal, in going out,\nstopped near Mr. Eshton’s chair, and said something to him in a low\nvoice, of which I heard only the words, “old woman,”—“quite\ntroublesome.”\n\n“Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself\noff,” replied the magistrate.\n\n“No—stop!” interrupted Colonel Dent. “Don’t send her away, Eshton; we\nmight turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies.” And\nspeaking aloud, he continued—“Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common\nto visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother\nBunches is in the servants’ hall at this moment, and insists upon being\nbrought in before ‘the quality,’ to tell them their fortunes. Would you\nlike to see her?”\n\n“Surely, colonel,” cried Lady Ingram, “you would not encourage such a\nlow impostor? Dismiss her, by all means, at once!”\n\n“But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady,” said the footman; “nor\ncan any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating\nher to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and\nsays nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in\nhere.”\n\n“What does she want?” asked Mrs. Eshton.\n\n“‘To tell the gentry their fortunes,’ she says, ma’am; and she swears\nshe must and will do it.”\n\n“What is she like?” inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.\n\n“A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock.”\n\n“Why, she’s a real sorceress!” cried Frederick Lynn. “Let us have her\nin, of course.”\n\n“To be sure,” rejoined his brother; “it would be a thousand pities to\nthrow away such a chance of fun.”\n\n“My dear boys, what are you thinking about?” exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.\n\n“I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding,”\nchimed in the Dowager Ingram.\n\n“Indeed, mama, but you can—and will,” pronounced the haughty voice of\nBlanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had\nsat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music. “I have a\ncuriosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame\nforward.”\n\n“My darling Blanche! recollect—”\n\n“I do—I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will—quick,\nSam!”\n\n“Yes—yes—yes!” cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen. “Let\nher come—it will be excellent sport!”\n\nThe footman still lingered. “She looks such a rough one,” said he.\n\n“Go!” ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.\n\nExcitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery\nand jests was proceeding when Sam returned.\n\n“She won’t come now,” said he. “She says it’s not her mission to appear\nbefore the ‘vulgar herd’ (them’s her words). I must show her into a\nroom by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her\none by one.”\n\n“You see now, my queenly Blanche,” began Lady Ingram, “she encroaches.\nBe advised, my angel girl—and—”\n\n“Show her into the library, of course,” cut in the “angel girl.” “It is\nnot my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean\nto have her all to myself. Is there a fire in the library?”\n\n“Yes, ma’am—but she looks such a tinkler.”\n\n“Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding.”\n\nAgain Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full\nflow once more.\n\n“She’s ready now,” said the footman, as he reappeared. “She wishes to\nknow who will be her first visitor.”\n\n“I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies\ngo,” said Colonel Dent.\n\n“Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming.”\n\nSam went and returned.\n\n“She says, sir, that she’ll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble\nthemselves to come near her; nor,” he added, with difficulty\nsuppressing a titter, “any ladies either, except the young, and\nsingle.”\n\n“By Jove, she has taste!” exclaimed Henry Lynn.\n\nMiss Ingram rose solemnly: “I go first,” she said, in a tone which\nmight have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in\nthe van of his men.\n\n“Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause—reflect!” was her mama’s cry; but\nshe swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which\nColonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.\n\nA comparative silence ensued. Lady Ingram thought it “le cas” to wring\nher hands: which she did accordingly. Miss Mary declared she felt, for\nher part, she never dared venture. Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under\ntheir breath, and looked a little frightened.\n\nThe minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the\nlibrary-door again opened. Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.\n\nWould she laugh? Would she take it as a joke? All eyes met her with a\nglance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and\ncoldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to\nher seat, and took it in silence.\n\n“Well, Blanche?” said Lord Ingram.\n\n“What did she say, sister?” asked Mary.\n\n“What did you think? How do you feel? Is she a real fortune-teller?”\ndemanded the Misses Eshton.\n\n“Now, now, good people,” returned Miss Ingram, “don’t press upon me.\nReally your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you\nseem, by the importance of you all—my good mama included—ascribe to\nthis matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the\nhouse, who is in close alliance with the old gentleman. I have seen a\ngipsy vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of\npalmistry and told me what such people usually tell. My whim is\ngratified; and now I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in\nthe stocks to-morrow morning, as he threatened.”\n\nMiss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined\nfurther conversation. I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all\nthat time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker,\nmore dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment. She\nhad obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me,\nfrom her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,\nnotwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance\nto whatever revelations had been made her.\n\n\nDuring all that time she never turned a page\n\nMeantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not\ngo alone; and yet they all wished to go. A negotiation was opened\nthrough the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and\nfro, till, I think, the said Sam’s calves must have ached with the\nexercise, permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from\nthe rigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.\n\nTheir visit was not so still as Miss Ingram’s had been: we heard\nhysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and\nat the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came\nrunning across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.\n\n“I am sure she is something not right!” they cried, one and all. “She\ntold us such things! She knows all about us!” and they sank breathless\ninto the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.\n\nPressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of\nthings they had said and done when they were mere children; described\nbooks and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that\ndifferent relations had presented to them. They affirmed that she had\neven divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the\nname of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of\nwhat they most wished for.\n\nHere the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further\nenlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,\nejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.\nThe matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again\nand again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning\nhad not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the\nyounger urged their services on the agitated fair ones.\n\nIn the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully\nengaged in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I\nturned, and saw Sam.\n\n“If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young\nsingle lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she\nwill not go till she has seen all. I thought it must be you: there is\nno one else for it. What shall I tell her?”\n\n“Oh, I will go by all means,” I answered: and I was glad of the\nunexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity. I slipped\nout of the room, unobserved by any eye—for the company were gathered in\none mass about the trembling trio just returned—and I closed the door\nquietly behind me.\n\n“If you like, miss,” said Sam, “I’ll wait in the hall for you; and if\nshe frightens you, just call and I’ll come in.”\n\n“No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid.” Nor was\nI; but I was a good deal interested and excited.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nThe library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl—if\nSibyl she were—was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the\nchimney-corner. She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a\nbroad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under\nher chin. An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending\nover the fire, and seemed reading in a little black book, like a\nprayer-book, by the light of the blaze: she muttered the words to\nherself, as most old women do, while she read; she did not desist\nimmediately on my entrance: it appeared she wished to finish a\nparagraph.\n\nI stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with\nsitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire. I felt now as\ncomposed as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the\ngipsy’s appearance to trouble one’s calm. She shut her book and slowly\nlooked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as\nshe raised it, that it was a strange one. It looked all brown and\nblack: elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed\nunder her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye\nconfronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze.\n\n“Well, and you want your fortune told?” she said, in a voice as decided\nas her glance, as harsh as her features.\n\n“I don’t care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to\nwarn you, I have no faith.”\n\n“It’s like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it\nin your step as you crossed the threshold.”\n\n“Did you? You’ve a quick ear.”\n\n“I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain.”\n\n“You need them all in your trade.”\n\n“I do; especially when I’ve customers like you to deal with. Why don’t\nyou tremble?”\n\n“I’m not cold.”\n\n“Why don’t you turn pale?”\n\n“I am not sick.”\n\n“Why don’t you consult my art?”\n\n“I’m not silly.”\n\nThe old crone “nichered” a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then\ndrew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke. Having\nindulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the\npipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very\ndeliberately—\n\n“You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly.”\n\n“Prove it,” I rejoined.\n\n“I will, in few words. You are cold, because you are alone: no contact\nstrikes the fire from you that is in you. You are sick; because the\nbest of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far\naway from you. You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not\nbeckon it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it\nwaits you.”\n\nShe again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking\nwith vigour.\n\n“You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a\nsolitary dependent in a great house.”\n\n“I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any\none?”\n\n“In my circumstances.”\n\n“Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely\nplaced as you are.”\n\n“It would be easy to find you thousands.”\n\n“You could scarcely find me one. If you knew it, you are peculiarly\nsituated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it. The materials\nare all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them. Chance\nlaid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss\nresults.”\n\n“I don’t understand enigmas. I never could guess a riddle in my life.”\n\n“If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm.”\n\n“And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?”\n\n“To be sure.”\n\nI gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she\ntook out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she\ntold me to hold out my hand. I did. She approached her face to the\npalm, and pored over it without touching it.\n\n“It is too fine,” said she. “I can make nothing of such a hand as that;\nalmost without lines: besides, what is in a palm? Destiny is not\nwritten there.”\n\n“I believe you,” said I.\n\n“No,” she continued, “it is in the face: on the forehead, about the\neyes, in the lines of the mouth. Kneel, and lift up your head.”\n\n“Ah! now you are coming to reality,” I said, as I obeyed her. “I shall\nbegin to put some faith in you presently.”\n\nI knelt within half a yard of her. She stirred the fire, so that a\nripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as\nshe sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.\n\n“I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night,” she said, when\nshe had examined me a while. “I wonder what thoughts are busy in your\nheart during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people\nflitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little\nsympathetic communion passing between you and them as if they were\nreally mere shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance.”\n\n“I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad.”\n\n“Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with\nwhispers of the future?”\n\n“Not I. The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings\nto set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself.”\n\n“A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that\nwindow-seat (you see I know your habits)—”\n\n“You have learned them from the servants.”\n\n“Ah! you think yourself sharp. Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I\nhave an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole—”\n\nI started to my feet when I heard the name.\n\n“You have—have you?” thought I; “there is diablerie in the business\nafter all, then!”\n\n“Don’t be alarmed,” continued the strange being; “she’s a safe hand is\nMrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her. But,\nas I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing\nbut your future school? Have you no present interest in any of the\ncompany who occupy the sofas and chairs before you? Is there not one\nface you study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least\ncuriosity?”\n\n“I like to observe all the faces and all the figures.”\n\n“But do you never single one from the rest—or it may be, two?”\n\n“I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a\ntale: it amuses me to watch them.”\n\n“What tale do you like best to hear?”\n\n“Oh, I have not much choice! They generally run on the same\ntheme—courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe—marriage.”\n\n“And do you like that monotonous theme?”\n\n“Positively, I don’t care about it: it is nothing to me.”\n\n“Nothing to you? When a lady, young and full of life and health,\ncharming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune,\nsits and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you—”\n\n“I what?”\n\n“You know—and perhaps think well of.”\n\n“I don’t know the gentlemen here. I have scarcely interchanged a\nsyllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider\nsome respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,\ndashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to\nbe the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling\ndisposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me.”\n\n“You don’t know the gentlemen here? You have not exchanged a syllable\nwith one of them? Will you say that of the master of the house!”\n\n“He is not at home.”\n\n“A profound remark! A most ingenious quibble! He went to Millcote this\nmorning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that\ncircumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance—blot him,\nas it were, out of existence?”\n\n“No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme\nyou had introduced.”\n\n“I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late\nso many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester’s eyes that they\noverflow like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked\nthat?”\n\n“Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests.”\n\n“No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all\nthe tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured\nwith the most lively and the most continuous?”\n\n“The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.” I said\nthis rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,\nmanner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream. One unexpected\nsentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web\nof mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for\nweeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every\npulse.\n\n“Eagerness of a listener!” repeated she: “yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by\nthe hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such\ndelight in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so\nwilling to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him;\nyou have noticed this?”\n\n“Grateful! I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face.”\n\n“Detecting! You have analysed, then. And what did you detect, if not\ngratitude?”\n\nI said nothing.\n\n“You have seen love: have you not?—and, looking forward, you have seen\nhim married, and beheld his bride happy?”\n\n“Humph! Not exactly. Your witch’s skill is rather at fault sometimes.”\n\n“What the devil have you seen, then?”\n\n“Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess. Is it known that\nMr. Rochester is to be married?”\n\n“Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram.”\n\n“Shortly?”\n\n“Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with\nan audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),\nthey will be a superlatively happy pair. He must love such a handsome,\nnoble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not\nhis person, at least his purse. I know she considers the Rochester\nestate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her\nsomething on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous\ngrave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch. I would advise her\nblackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or\nclearer rent-roll,—he’s dished—”\n\n“But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester’s fortune: I came to\nhear my own; and you have told me nothing of it.”\n\n“Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait\ncontradicted another. Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that\nI know. I knew it before I came here this evening. She has laid it\ncarefully on one side for you. I saw her do it. It depends on yourself\nto stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so,\nis the problem I study. Kneel again on the rug.”\n\n“Don’t keep me long; the fire scorches me.”\n\n\nShe did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair\n\nI knelt. She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in\nher chair. She began muttering,—\n\n“The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft\nand full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;\nimpression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases\nto smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that\nsignifies melancholy resulting from loneliness. It turns from me; it\nwill not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking\nglance, the truth of the discoveries I have already made,—to disown the\ncharge both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only\nconfirm me in my opinion. The eye is favourable.\n\n“As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to\nimpart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be\nsilent on much the heart experiences. Mobile and flexible, it was never\nintended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a\nmouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection\nfor its interlocutor. That feature too is propitious.\n\n“I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow\nprofesses to say,—‘I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances\nrequire me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. I have an\ninward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous\ndelights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford\nto give.’ The forehead declares, ‘Reason sits firm and holds the reins,\nand she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild\nchasms. The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they\nare; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment\nshall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote\nin every decision. Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by:\nbut I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which\ninterprets the dictates of conscience.’\n\n“Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected. I have\nformed my plans—right plans I deem them—and in them I have attended to\nthe claims of conscience, the counsels of reason. I know how soon youth\nwould fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one\ndreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not\nwant sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution—such is not my taste. I wish to\nfoster, not to blight—to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of\nblood—no, nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments,\nin sweet—That will do. I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.\nI should wish now to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare\nnot. So far I have governed myself thoroughly. I have acted as I\ninwardly swore I would act; but further might try me beyond my\nstrength. Rise, Miss Eyre: leave me; the play is played out’.”\n\nWhere was I? Did I wake or sleep? Had I been dreaming? Did I dream\nstill? The old woman’s voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and\nall were familiar to me as my own face in a glass—as the speech of my\nown tongue. I got up, but did not go. I looked; I stirred the fire, and\nI looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about\nher face, and again beckoned me to depart. The flame illuminated her\nhand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at\nonce noticed that hand. It was no more the withered limb of eld than my\nown; it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically\nturned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping\nforward, I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times\nbefore. Again I looked at the face; which was no longer turned from\nme—on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the\nhead advanced.\n\n“Well, Jane, do you know me?” asked the familiar voice.\n\n“Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then—”\n\n“But the string is in a knot—help me.”\n\n“Break it, sir.”\n\n“There, then—‘Off, ye lendings!’” And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his\ndisguise.\n\n“Now, sir, what a strange idea!”\n\n“But well carried out, eh? Don’t you think so?”\n\n“With the ladies you must have managed well.”\n\n“But not with you?”\n\n“You did not act the character of a gipsy with me.”\n\n“What character did I act? My own?”\n\n“No; some unaccountable one. In short, I believe you have been trying\nto draw me out—or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk\nnonsense. It is scarcely fair, sir.”\n\n“Do you forgive me, Jane?”\n\n“I cannot tell till I have thought it all over. If, on reflection, I\nfind I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;\nbut it was not right.”\n\n“Oh, you have been very correct—very careful, very sensible.”\n\nI reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had. It was a comfort; but,\nindeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the\ninterview. Something of masquerade I suspected. I knew gipsies and\nfortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman\nhad expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her\nanxiety to conceal her features. But my mind had been running on Grace\nPoole—that living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered\nher. I had never thought of Mr. Rochester.\n\n“Well,” said he, “what are you musing about? What does that grave smile\nsignify?”\n\n“Wonder and self-congratulation, sir. I have your permission to retire\nnow, I suppose?”\n\n“No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room\nyonder are doing.”\n\n“Discussing the gipsy, I daresay.”\n\n“Sit down!—Let me hear what they said about me.”\n\n“I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o’clock. Oh,\nare you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since\nyou left this morning?”\n\n“A stranger!—no; who can it be? I expected no one; is he gone?”\n\n“No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty\nof installing himself here till you returned.”\n\n“The devil he did! Did he give his name?”\n\n“His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from\nSpanish Town, in Jamaica, I think.”\n\nMr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead\nme to a chair. As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile\non his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.\n\n“Mason!—the West Indies!” he said, in the tone one might fancy a\nspeaking automaton to enounce its single words; “Mason!—the West\nIndies!” he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,\ngrowing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly\nseemed to know what he was doing.\n\n“Do you feel ill, sir?” I inquired.\n\n“Jane, I’ve got a blow; I’ve got a blow, Jane!” He staggered.\n\n“Oh, lean on me, sir.”\n\n“Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now.”\n\n“Yes, sir, yes; and my arm.”\n\nHe sat down, and made me sit beside him. Holding my hand in both his\nown, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most\ntroubled and dreary look.\n\n“My little friend!” said he, “I wish I were in a quiet island with only\nyou; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from\nme.”\n\n“Can I help you, sir?—I’d give my life to serve you.”\n\n“Jane, if aid is wanted, I’ll seek it at your hands; I promise you\nthat.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. Tell me what to do,—I’ll try, at least, to do it.”\n\n“Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be\nat supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is\ndoing.”\n\nI went. I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.\nRochester had said; they were not seated at table,—the supper was\narranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood\nabout here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their\nhands. Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were\ngeneral and animated. Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel\nand Mrs. Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them. I filled a\nwine-glass (I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she\nthought I was taking a liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the\nlibrary.\n\nMr. Rochester’s extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more\nfirm and stern. He took the glass from my hand.\n\n“Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!” he said. He swallowed the\ncontents and returned it to me. “What are they doing, Jane?”\n\n“Laughing and talking, sir.”\n\n“They don’t look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something\nstrange?”\n\n“Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety.”\n\n“And Mason?”\n\n“He was laughing too.”\n\n“If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,\nJane?”\n\n“Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could.”\n\nHe half smiled. “But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at\nme coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then\ndropped off and left me one by one, what then? Would you go with them?”\n\n“I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with\nyou.”\n\n“To comfort me?”\n\n“Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could.”\n\n“And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?”\n\n“I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I\nshould care nothing about it.”\n\n“Then, you could dare censure for my sake?”\n\n“I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence;\nas you, I am sure, do.”\n\n“Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in\nhis ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in\nhere and then leave me.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\nI did his behest. The company all stared at me as I passed straight\namong them. I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him\nfrom the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went\nupstairs.\n\nAt a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors\nrepair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester’s voice, and\nheard him say, “This way, Mason; this is your room.”\n\nHe spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease. I was soon\nasleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nI had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to\nlet down my window-blind. The consequence was, that when the moon,\nwhich was full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course\nto that space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me\nthrough the unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me. Awaking in the\ndead of night, I opened my eyes on her disk—silver-white and crystal\nclear. It was beautiful, but too solemn: I half rose, and stretched my\narm to draw the curtain.\n\nGood God! What a cry!\n\nThe night—its silence—its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,\na shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.\n\nMy pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.\nThe cry died, and was not renewed. Indeed, whatever being uttered that\nfearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor\non the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the\ncloud shrouding his eyrie. The thing delivering such utterance must\nrest ere it could repeat the effort.\n\nIt came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead. And\noverhead—yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling—I now heard a\nstruggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered\nvoice shouted—\n\n“Help! help! help!” three times rapidly.\n\n“Will no one come?” it cried; and then, while the staggering and\nstamping went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:—\n\n“Rochester! Rochester! for God’s sake, come!”\n\nA chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.\nAnother step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and\nthere was silence.\n\nI had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued\nfrom my apartment. The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,\nterrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one\nlooked out and another looked out; the gallery filled. Gentlemen and\nladies alike had quitted their beds; and “Oh! what is it?”—“Who is\nhurt?”—“What has happened?”—“Fetch a light!”—“Is it fire?”—“Are there\nrobbers?”—“Where shall we run?” was demanded confusedly on all hands.\nBut for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness. They\nran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the\nconfusion was inextricable.\n\n“Where the devil is Rochester?” cried Colonel Dent. “I cannot find him\nin his bed.”\n\n“Here! here!” was shouted in return. “Be composed, all of you: I’m\ncoming.”\n\nAnd the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester\nadvanced with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.\nOne of the ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss\nIngram.\n\n“What awful event has taken place?” said she. “Speak! let us know the\nworst at once!”\n\n“But don’t pull me down or strangle me,” he replied: for the Misses\nEshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white\nwrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.\n\n“All’s right!—all’s right!” he cried. “It’s a mere rehearsal of Much\nAdo about Nothing. Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous.”\n\nAnd dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks. Calming himself\nby an effort, he added—\n\n“A servant has had the nightmare; that is all. She’s an excitable,\nnervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or\nsomething of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright. Now,\nthen, I must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is\nsettled, she cannot be looked after. Gentlemen, have the goodness to\nset the ladies the example. Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in\nevincing superiority to idle terrors. Amy and Louisa, return to your\nnests like a pair of doves, as you are. Mesdames” (to the dowagers),\n“you will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill\ngallery any longer.”\n\nAnd so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to\nget them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories. I did\nnot wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as\nunnoticed I had left it.\n\nNot, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself\ncarefully. The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that\nhad been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had\nproceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not\na servant’s dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and\nthat the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention\nframed to pacify his guests. I dressed, then, to be ready for\nemergencies. When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out\nover the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not\nwhat. It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry,\nstruggle, and call.\n\nNo: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and\nin about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert. It\nseemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire. Meantime the moon\ndeclined: she was about to set. Not liking to sit in the cold and\ndarkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was. I\nleft the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I\nstooped to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.\n\n“Am I wanted?” I asked.\n\n“Are you up?” asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master’s.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“And dressed?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Come out, then, quietly.”\n\nI obeyed. Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.\n\n“I want you,” he said: “come this way: take your time, and make no\nnoise.”\n\nMy slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a\ncat. He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the\ndark, low corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and\nstood at his side.\n\n“Have you a sponge in your room?” he asked in a whisper.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Have you any salts—volatile salts?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Go back and fetch both.”\n\nI returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,\nand once more retraced my steps. He still waited; he held a key in his\nhand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;\nhe paused, and addressed me again.\n\n“You don’t turn sick at the sight of blood?”\n\n“I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet.”\n\nI felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no\nfaintness.\n\n“Just give me your hand,” he said: “it will not do to risk a fainting\nfit.”\n\nI put my fingers into his. “Warm and steady,” was his remark: he turned\nthe key and opened the door.\n\nI saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax\nshowed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry\nwas now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had\nthen been concealed. This door was open; a light shone out of the room\nwithin: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog\nquarrelling. Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, “Wait\na minute,” and he went forward to the inner apartment. A shout of\nlaughter greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace\nPoole’s own goblin ha! ha! _She_ then was there. He made some sort of\narrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him:\nhe came out and closed the door behind him.\n\n“Here, Jane!” he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large\nbed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of\nthe chamber. An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,\ndressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant\nback; his eyes were closed. Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I\nrecognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face—the stranger, Mason:\nI saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in\nblood.\n\n“Hold the candle,” said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a\nbasin of water from the washstand: “Hold that,” said he. I obeyed. He\ntook the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he\nasked for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils. Mr. Mason\nshortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned. Mr. Rochester opened the shirt\nof the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged\naway blood, trickling fast down.\n\n“Is there immediate danger?” murmured Mr. Mason.\n\n“Pooh! No—a mere scratch. Don’t be so overcome, man: bear up! I’ll\nfetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you’ll be able to be removed by\nmorning, I hope. Jane,” he continued.\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an\nhour, or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it\nreturns: if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that\nstand to his lips, and your salts to his nose. You will not speak to\nhim on any pretext—and—Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if\nyou speak to her: open your lips—agitate yourself—and I’ll not answer\nfor the consequences.”\n\nAgain the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,\neither of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.\nMr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded\nto use it as he had done. He watched me a second, then saying,\n“Remember!—No conversation,” he left the room. I experienced a strange\nfeeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating\nstep ceased to be heard.\n\nHere then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic\ncells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and\nhands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes—that\nwas appalling—the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of\nGrace Poole bursting out upon me.\n\nI must keep to my post, however. I must watch this ghastly\ncountenance—these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose—these eyes now\nshut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me,\nand ever glazed with the dulness of horror. I must dip my hand again\nand again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling\ngore. I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my\nemployment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round\nme, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver\nstrangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite—whose front,\ndivided into twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the\ntwelve apostles, each enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame;\nwhile above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.\n\nAccording as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here\nor glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his\nbrow; now St. John’s long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face\nof Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and\nthreatening a revelation of the arch-traitor—of Satan himself—in his\nsubordinate’s form.\n\nAmidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the\nmovements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den. But since\nMr. Rochester’s visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but\nthree sounds at three long intervals,—a step creak, a momentary renewal\nof the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.\n\nThen my own thoughts worried me. What crime was this, that lived\nincarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled\nnor subdued by the owner?—what mystery, that broke out now in fire and\nnow in blood, at the deadest hours of night? What creature was it,\nthat, masked in an ordinary woman’s face and shape, uttered the voice,\nnow of a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?\n\nAnd this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger—how had he\nbecome involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at\nhim? What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely\nseason, when he should have been asleep in bed? I had heard Mr.\nRochester assign him an apartment below—what brought him here! And why,\nnow, was he so tame under the violence or treachery done him? Why did\nhe so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced? Why\n_did_ Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment? His guest had been\noutraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted\nagainst; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in\noblivion! Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that\nthe impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the inertness\nof the former: the few words which had passed between them assured me\nof this. It was evident that in their former intercourse, the passive\ndisposition of the one had been habitually influenced by the active\nenergy of the other: whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester’s dismay when\nhe heard of Mr. Mason’s arrival? Why had the mere name of this\nunresisting individual—whom his word now sufficed to control like a\nchild—fallen on him, a few hours since, as a thunderbolt might fall on\nan oak?\n\nOh! I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:\n“Jane, I have got a blow—I have got a blow, Jane.” I could not forget\nhow the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no\nlight matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the\nvigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.\n\n“When will he come? When will he come?” I cried inwardly, as the night\nlingered and lingered—as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:\nand neither day nor aid arrived. I had, again and again, held the water\nto Mason’s white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating\nsalts: my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental\nsuffering, or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast\nprostrating his strength. He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and\nlost, I feared he was dying; and I might not even speak to him.\n\nThe candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived\nstreaks of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then\napproaching. Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant\nkennel in the courtyard: hope revived. Nor was it unwarranted: in five\nminutes more the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was\nrelieved. It could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has\nseemed shorter.\n\nMr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.\n\n“Now, Carter, be on the alert,” he said to this last: “I give you but\nhalf-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting\nthe patient downstairs and all.”\n\n“But is he fit to move, sir?”\n\n“No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must\nbe kept up. Come, set to work.”\n\nMr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind,\nlet in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to\nsee how far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to\nbrighten the east. Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was\nalready handling.\n\n“Now, my good fellow, how are you?” he asked.\n\n“She’s done for me, I fear,” was the faint reply.\n\n“Not a whit!—courage! This day fortnight you’ll hardly be a pin the\nworse of it: you’ve lost a little blood; that’s all. Carter, assure him\nthere’s no danger.”\n\n“I can do that conscientiously,” said Carter, who had now undone the\nbandages; “only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have\nbled so much—but how is this? The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well\nas cut. This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth\nhere!”\n\n“She bit me,” he murmured. “She worried me like a tigress, when\nRochester got the knife from her.”\n\n“You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at\nonce,” said Mr. Rochester.\n\n“But under such circumstances, what could one do?” returned Mason. “Oh,\nit was frightful!” he added, shuddering. “And I did not expect it: she\nlooked so quiet at first.”\n\n“I warned you,” was his friend’s answer; “I said—be on your guard when\nyou go near her. Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had\nme with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and\nalone.”\n\n“I thought I could have done some good.”\n\n“You thought! you thought! Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,\nhowever, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not\ntaking my advice; so I’ll say no more. Carter—hurry!—hurry! The sun\nwill soon rise, and I must have him off.”\n\n“Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged. I must look to this\nother wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think.”\n\n“She sucked the blood: she said she’d drain my heart,” said Mason.\n\nI saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,\nhorror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he\nonly said—\n\n“Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don’t repeat\nit.”\n\n“I wish I could forget it,” was the answer.\n\n“You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish\nTown, you may think of her as dead and buried—or rather, you need not\nthink of her at all.”\n\n“Impossible to forget this night!”\n\n“It is not impossible: have some energy, man. You thought you were as\ndead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking\nnow. There!—Carter has done with you or nearly so; I’ll make you decent\nin a trice. Jane” (he turned to me for the first time since his\nre-entrance), “take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk\nstraight forward into my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the\nwardrobe and take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them\nhere; and be nimble.”\n\nI went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles\nnamed, and returned with them.\n\n“Now,” said he, “go to the other side of the bed while I order his\ntoilet; but don’t leave the room: you may be wanted again.”\n\nI retired as directed.\n\n“Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?” inquired Mr.\nRochester presently.\n\n“No, sir; all was very still.”\n\n“We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for\nyour sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder. I have striven\nlong to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last. Here,\nCarter, help him on with his waist-coat. Where did you leave your\nfurred cloak? You can’t travel a mile without that, I know, in this\ndamned cold climate. In your room?—Jane, run down to Mr. Mason’s\nroom,—the one next mine,—and fetch a cloak you will see there.”\n\nAgain I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and\nedged with fur.\n\n“Now, I’ve another errand for you,” said my untiring master; “you must\naway to my room again. What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!—a\nclod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture. You must open\nthe middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a\nlittle glass you will find there,—quick!”\n\nI flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.\n\n“That’s well! Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a\ndose myself, on my own responsibility. I got this cordial at Rome, of\nan Italian charlatan—a fellow you would have kicked, Carter. It is not\na thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as\nnow, for instance. Jane, a little water.”\n\nHe held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle\non the washstand.\n\n“That will do;—now wet the lip of the phial.”\n\nI did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented\nit to Mason.\n\n“Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or\nso.”\n\n“But will it hurt me?—is it inflammatory?”\n\n“Drink! drink! drink!”\n\nMr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist. He was\ndressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and\nsullied. Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed\nthe liquid; he then took his arm—\n\n“Now I am sure you can get on your feet,” he said—“try.”\n\nThe patient rose.\n\n“Carter, take him under the other shoulder. Be of good cheer, Richard;\nstep out—that’s it!”\n\n“I do feel better,” remarked Mr. Mason.\n\n“I am sure you do. Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;\nunbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise\nyou will see in the yard—or just outside, for I told him not to drive\nhis rattling wheels over the pavement—to be ready; we are coming: and,\nJane, if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem.”\n\nIt was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of\nrising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent. The side-passage\ndoor was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all\nthe yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a\npost-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,\nstationed outside. I approached him, and said the gentlemen were\ncoming; he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened. The\nstillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet\ndrawn over the servants’ chamber windows; little birds were just\ntwittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped\nlike white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the\ncarriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables: all\nelse was still.\n\nThe gentlemen now appeared. Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the\nsurgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the\nchaise; Carter followed.\n\n“Take care of him,” said Mr. Rochester to the latter, “and keep him at\nyour house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to\nsee how he gets on. Richard, how is it with you?”\n\n“The fresh air revives me, Fairfax.”\n\n“Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind—good-bye,\nDick.”\n\n“Fairfax—”\n\n“Well what is it?”\n\n“Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be:\nlet her—” he stopped and burst into tears.\n\n“I do my best; and have done it, and will do it,” was the answer: he\nshut up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.\n\n“Yet would to God there was an end of all this!” added Mr. Rochester,\nas he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.\n\nThis done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in\nthe wall bordering the orchard. I, supposing he had done with me,\nprepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call\n“Jane!” He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.\n\n“Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments,” he said; “that\nhouse is a mere dungeon: don’t you feel it so?”\n\n“It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.”\n\n“The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,” he answered; “and you\nsee it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is\nslime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,\nand the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark. Now _here_”\n(he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) “all is real, sweet,\nand pure.”\n\nHe strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees,\nand cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all\nsorts of old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses,\npansies, mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant\nherbs. They were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams,\nfollowed by a lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just\nentering the dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and\ndewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them.\n\n“Jane, will you have a flower?”\n\nHe gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to\nme.\n\n“Thank you, sir.”\n\n“Do you like this sunrise, Jane? That sky with its high and light\nclouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm—this placid\nand balmly atmosphere?”\n\n“I do, very much.”\n\n“You have passed a strange night, Jane.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“And it has made you look pale—were you afraid when I left you alone\nwith Mason?”\n\n“I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room.”\n\n“But I had fastened the door—I had the key in my pocket: I should have\nbeen a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb—my pet lamb—so near a\nwolf’s den, unguarded: you were safe.”\n\n“Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?”\n\n“Oh yes! don’t trouble your head about her—put the thing out of your\nthoughts.”\n\n“Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays.”\n\n“Never fear—I will take care of myself.”\n\n“Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?”\n\n“I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.\nTo live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack\nand spue fire any day.”\n\n“But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led. Your influence, sir, is\nevidently potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or\nwilfully injure you.”\n\n“Oh, no! Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me—but,\nunintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive\nme, if not of life, yet for ever of happiness.”\n\n“Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him\nhow to avert the danger.”\n\nHe laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it\nfrom him.\n\n“If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be? Annihilated\nin a moment. Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to\nhim ‘Do that,’ and the thing has been done. But I cannot give him\norders in this case: I cannot say ‘Beware of harming me, Richard;’ for\nit is imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is\npossible. Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further. You are\nmy little friend, are you not?”\n\n“I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right.”\n\n“Precisely: I see you do. I see genuine contentment in your gait and\nmien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing\nme—working for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say,\n‘_all that is right_:’ for if I bid you do what you thought wrong,\nthere would be no light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no\nlively glance and animated complexion. My friend would then turn to me,\nquiet and pale, and would say, ‘No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot\ndo it, because it is wrong;’ and would become immutable as a fixed\nstar. Well, you too have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare\nnot show you where I am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you\nare, you should transfix me at once.”\n\n“If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,\nyou are very safe.”\n\n“God grant it may be so! Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down.”\n\nThe arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a\nrustic seat. Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but\nI stood before him.\n\n“Sit,” he said; “the bench is long enough for two. You don’t hesitate\nto take a place at my side, do you? Is that wrong, Jane?”\n\nI answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been\nunwise.\n\n“Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew—while all the\nflowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their\nyoung ones’ breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do\ntheir first spell of work—I’ll put a case to you, which you must\nendeavour to suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you\nare at ease, and not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you\nerr in staying.”\n\n“No, sir; I am content.”\n\n“Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:—suppose you were no longer a\ngirl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from\nchildhood upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive\nthat you there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from\nwhat motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life\nand taint all your existence. Mind, I don’t say a _crime_; I am not\nspeaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make\nthe perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_. The results of\nwhat you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you\ntake measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful\nnor culpable. Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the\nvery confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which\nyou feel will not leave it till the time of setting. Bitter and base\nassociations have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here\nand there, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure—I mean in\nheartless, sensual pleasure—such as dulls intellect and blights\nfeeling. Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of\nvoluntary banishment: you make a new acquaintance—how or where no\nmatter: you find in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities\nwhich you have sought for twenty years, and never before encountered;\nand they are all fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint. Such\nsociety revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back—higher\nwishes, purer feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to\nspend what remains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal\nbeing. To attain this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle\nof custom—a mere conventional impediment which neither your conscience\nsanctifies nor your judgment approves?”\n\nHe paused for an answer: and what was I to say? Oh, for some good\nspirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response! Vain\naspiration! The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle\nAriel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the\ntree-tops; but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate.\n\nAgain Mr. Rochester propounded his query:\n\n“Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man\njustified in daring the world’s opinion, in order to attach to him for\never this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own\npeace of mind and regeneration of life?”\n\n“Sir,” I answered, “a wanderer’s repose or a sinner’s reformation\nshould never depend on a fellow-creature. Men and women die;\nphilosophers falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one\nyou know has suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals\nfor strength to amend and solace to heal.”\n\n“But the instrument—the instrument! God, who does the work, ordains the\ninstrument. I have myself—I tell it you without parable—been a worldly,\ndissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the instrument for\nmy cure in—”\n\nHe paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling. I\nalmost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch\nthe suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many\nminutes—so long was the silence protracted. At last I looked up at the\ntardy speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.\n\n“Little friend,” said he, in quite a changed tone—while his face\nchanged too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh\nand sarcastic—“you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram:\ndon’t you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a\nvengeance?”\n\nHe got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when\nhe came back he was humming a tune.\n\n“Jane, Jane,” said he, stopping before me, “you are quite pale with\nyour vigils: don’t you curse me for disturbing your rest?”\n\n“Curse you? No, sir.”\n\n“Shake hands in confirmation of the word. What cold fingers! They were\nwarmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious\nchamber. Jane, when will you watch with me again?”\n\n“Whenever I can be useful, sir.”\n\n“For instance, the night before I am married! I am sure I shall not be\nable to sleep. Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?\nTo you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know\nher.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“She’s a rare one, is she not, Jane?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“A strapper—a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair\njust such as the ladies of Carthage must have had. Bless me! there’s\nDent and Lynn in the stables! Go in by the shrubbery, through that\nwicket.”\n\nAs I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying\ncheerfully—\n\n“Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before\nsunrise: I rose at four to see him off.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nPresentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are\nsigns; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has\nnot yet found the key. I never laughed at presentiments in my life,\nbecause I have had strange ones of my own. Sympathies, I believe, exist\n(for instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged\nrelatives asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the\nsource to which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal\ncomprehension. And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies\nof Nature with man.\n\nWhen I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie\nLeaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little\nchild; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either\nto one’s self or one’s kin. The saying might have worn out of my\nmemory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which served\nindelibly to fix it there. The next day Bessie was sent for home to the\ndeathbed of her little sister.\n\nOf late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during\nthe past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not\nbrought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my\narms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with\ndaisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water. It\nwas a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it\nnestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the\napparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven\nsuccessive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.\n\nI did not like this iteration of one idea—this strange recurrence of\none image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the\nvision drew near. It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I\nhad been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it\nwas on the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by\na message that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax’s room. On repairing\nthither, I found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a\ngentleman’s servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he\nheld in his hand was surrounded with a crape band.\n\n“I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,” he said, rising as I entered;\n“but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were\nat Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still.”\n\n“Oh, Robert! how do you do? I remember you very well: you used to give\nme a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana’s bay pony. And how is Bessie?\nYou are married to Bessie?”\n\n“Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another\nlittle one about two months since—we have three now—and both mother and\nchild are thriving.”\n\n“And are the family well at the house, Robert?”\n\n“I am sorry I can’t give you better news of them, Miss: they are very\nbadly at present—in great trouble.”\n\n“I hope no one is dead,” I said, glancing at his black dress. He too\nlooked down at the crape round his hat and replied—\n\n“Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London.”\n\n“Mr. John?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And how does his mother bear it?”\n\n“Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been\nvery wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways,\nand his death was shocking.”\n\n“I heard from Bessie he was not doing well.”\n\n“Doing well! He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate\namongst the worst men and the worst women. He got into debt and into\njail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he\nreturned to his old companions and habits. His head was not strong: the\nknaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard. He\ncame down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give\nup all to him. Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by\nhis extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he\nwas dead. How he died, God knows!—they say he killed himself.”\n\nI was silent: the tidings were frightful. Robert Leaven resumed—\n\n“Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very\nstout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of\npoverty were quite breaking her down. The information about Mr. John’s\ndeath and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.\nShe was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather\nbetter: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making\nsigns to my wife and mumbling. It was only yesterday morning, however,\nthat Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she\nmade out the words, ‘Bring Jane—fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to\nher.’ Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means\nanything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and\nadvised them to send for you. The young ladies put it off at first; but\ntheir mother grew so restless, and said, ‘Jane, Jane,’ so many times,\nthat at last they consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can\nget ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow\nmorning.”\n\n“Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.”\n\n“I think so too, Miss. Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:\nbut I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?”\n\n“Yes; and I will do it now;” and having directed him to the servants’\nhall, and recommended him to the care of John’s wife, and the\nattentions of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.\n\nHe was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the\nstables, or the grounds. I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;—yes:\nshe believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram. To the\nbilliard-room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices\nresounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton,\nand their admirers, were all busied in the game. It required some\ncourage to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one\nI could not defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss\nIngram’s side. She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily:\nher eyes seemed to demand, “What can the creeping creature want now?”\nand when I said, in a low voice, “Mr. Rochester,” she made a movement\nas if tempted to order me away. I remember her appearance at the\nmoment—it was very graceful and very striking: she wore a morning robe\nof sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure scarf was twisted in her hair. She had\nbeen all animation with the game, and irritated pride did not lower the\nexpression of her haughty lineaments.\n\n“Does that person want you?” she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.\nRochester turned to see who the “person” was. He made a curious\ngrimace—one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations—threw down his\ncue and followed me from the room.\n\n“Well, Jane?” he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom\ndoor, which he had shut.\n\n“If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.”\n\n“What to do?—where to go?”\n\n“To see a sick lady who has sent for me.”\n\n“What sick lady?—where does she live?”\n\n“At Gateshead; in ——shire.”\n\n“-shire? That is a hundred miles off! Who may she be that sends for\npeople to see her that distance?”\n\n“Her name is Reed, sir—Mrs. Reed.”\n\n“Reed of Gateshead? There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.”\n\n“It is his widow, sir.”\n\n“And what have you to do with her? How do you know her?”\n\n“Mr. Reed was my uncle—my mother’s brother.”\n\n“The deuce he was! You never told me that before: you always said you\nhad no relations.”\n\n“None that would own me, sir. Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me\noff.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.”\n\n“But Reed left children?—you must have cousins? Sir George Lynn was\ntalking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the\nveriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of\nthe same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago\nin London.”\n\n“John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his\nfamily, and is supposed to have committed suicide. The news so shocked\nhis mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.”\n\n“And what good can you do her? Nonsense, Jane! I would never think of\nrunning a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead\nbefore you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off.”\n\n“Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very\ndifferent: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.”\n\n“How long will you stay?”\n\n“As short a time as possible, sir.”\n\n“Promise me only to stay a week—”\n\n“I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it.”\n\n“At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any\npretext to take up a permanent residence with her?”\n\n“Oh, no! I shall certainly return if all be well.”\n\n“And who goes with you? You don’t travel a hundred miles alone.”\n\n“No, sir, she has sent her coachman.”\n\n“A person to be trusted?”\n\n“Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.”\n\nMr. Rochester meditated. “When do you wish to go?”\n\n“Early to-morrow morning, sir.”\n\n“Well, you must have some money; you can’t travel without money, and I\ndaresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet. How much\nhave you in the world, Jane?” he asked, smiling.\n\nI drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was. “Five shillings, sir.” He\ntook the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as\nif its scantiness amused him. Soon he produced his pocket-book: “Here,”\nsaid he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but\nfifteen. I told him I had no change.\n\n“I don’t want change; you know that. Take your wages.”\n\nI declined accepting more than was my due. He scowled at first; then,\nas if recollecting something, he said—\n\n“Right, right! Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay\naway three months if you had fifty pounds. There are ten; is it not\nplenty?”\n\n“Yes, sir, but now you owe me five.”\n\n“Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you\nwhile I have the opportunity.”\n\n“Matter of business? I am curious to hear it.”\n\n“You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be\nmarried?”\n\n“Yes; what then?”\n\n“In that case, sir, Adèle ought to go to school: I am sure you will\nperceive the necessity of it.”\n\n“To get her out of my bride’s way, who might otherwise walk over her\nrather too emphatically? There’s sense in the suggestion; not a doubt\nof it. Adèle, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must\nmarch straight to—the devil?”\n\n“I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere.”\n\n“In course!” he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of\nfeatures equally fantastic and ludicrous. He looked at me some minutes.\n\n“And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by\nyou to seek a place, I suppose?”\n\n“No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me\nin asking favours of them—but I shall advertise.”\n\n“You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!” he growled. “At your peril\nyou advertise! I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten\npounds. Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I’ve a use for it.”\n\n“And so have I, sir,” I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind\nme. “I could not spare the money on any account.”\n\n“Little niggard!” said he, “refusing me a pecuniary request! Give me\nfive pounds, Jane.”\n\n“Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence.”\n\n“Just let me look at the cash.”\n\n“No, sir; you are not to be trusted.”\n\n“Jane!”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“Promise me one thing.”\n\n“I’ll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform.”\n\n“Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me. I’ll\nfind you one in time.”\n\n“I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that\nI and Adèle shall be both safe out of the house before your bride\nenters it.”\n\n“Very well! very well! I’ll pledge my word on it. You go to-morrow,\nthen?”\n\n“Yes, sir; early.”\n\n“Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?”\n\n“No, sir, I must prepare for the journey.”\n\n“Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?”\n\n“I suppose so, sir.”\n\n“And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane? Teach me;\nI’m not quite up to it.”\n\n“They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.”\n\n“Then say it.”\n\n“Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.”\n\n“What must I say?”\n\n“The same, if you like, sir.”\n\n“Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly. I should like\nsomething else: a little addition to the rite. If one shook hands, for\ninstance; but no—that would not content me either. So you’ll do no more\nthan say Farewell, Jane?”\n\n“It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty\nword as in many.”\n\n“Very likely; but it is blank and cool—‘Farewell.’”\n\n“How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?” I\nasked myself; “I want to commence my packing.” The dinner-bell rang,\nand suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no\nmore during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.\n\nI reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o’clock in the afternoon of\nthe first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall. It\nwas very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little\nwhite curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were\nburnished bright, and the fire burnt clear. Bessie sat on the hearth,\nnursing her last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a\ncorner.\n\n“Bless you!—I knew you would come!” exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I\nentered.\n\n“Yes, Bessie,” said I, after I had kissed her; “and I trust I am not\ntoo late. How is Mrs. Reed?—Alive still, I hope.”\n\n“Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was. The\ndoctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she\nwill finally recover.”\n\n“Has she mentioned me lately?”\n\n“She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,\nbut she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the\nhouse. She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and\nwakes up about six or seven. Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,\nand then I will go up with you?”\n\nRobert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle\nand went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my\nbonnet and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired. I was\nglad to accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my\ntravelling garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when\na child.\n\nOld times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling\nabout—setting out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and\nbutter, toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert\nor Jane an occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in\nformer days. Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light\nfoot and good looks.\n\nTea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit\nstill, quite in her old peremptory tones. I must be served at the\nfireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with\nmy cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me\nwith some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled\nand obeyed her as in bygone days.\n\nShe wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of\na person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,\nwhether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him. I told her he was\nrather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me\nkindly, and I was content. Then I went on to describe to her the gay\ncompany that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details\nBessie listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she\nrelished.\n\nIn such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my\nbonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.\nIt was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago,\nwalked down the path I was now ascending. On a dark, misty, raw morning\nin January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered\nheart—a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation—to seek the chilly\nharbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored. The same\nhostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;\nand I had yet an aching heart. I still felt as a wanderer on the face\nof the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own\npowers, and less withering dread of oppression. The gaping wound of my\nwrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment\nextinguished.\n\n“You shall go into the breakfast-room first,” said Bessie, as she\npreceded me through the hall; “the young ladies will be there.”\n\nIn another moment I was within that apartment. There was every article\nof furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first\nintroduced to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still\ncovered the hearth. Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could\ndistinguish the two volumes of Bewick’s British Birds occupying their\nold place on the third shelf, and Gulliver’s Travels and the Arabian\nNights ranged just above. The inanimate objects were not changed; but\nthe living things had altered past recognition.\n\nTwo young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as\nMiss Ingram—very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien. There\nwas something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme\nplainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen\ncollar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of\na string of ebony beads and a crucifix. This I felt sure was Eliza,\nthough I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that\nelongated and colourless visage.\n\nThe other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I\nremembered—the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven. This was a\nfull-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and\nregular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair. The\nhue of her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from\nher sister’s—so much more flowing and becoming—it looked as stylish as\nthe other’s looked puritanical.\n\nIn each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother—and only one;\nthe thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent’s Cairngorm eye: the\nblooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and\nchin—perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable\nhardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.\n\nBoth ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me\nby the name of “Miss Eyre.” Eliza’s greeting was delivered in a short,\nabrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her\neyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me. Georgiana added to her “How\nd’ye do?” several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so\non, uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry\nside-glances that measured me from head to foot—now traversing the\nfolds of my drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain\ntrimming of my cottage bonnet. Young ladies have a remarkable way of\nletting you know that they think you a “quiz” without actually saying\nthe words. A certain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner,\nnonchalance of tone, express fully their sentiments on the point,\nwithout committing them by any positive rudeness in word or deed.\n\nA sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power\nover me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised\nto find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the\nsemi-sarcastic attentions of the other—Eliza did not mortify, nor\nGeorgiana ruffle me. The fact was, I had other things to think about;\nwithin the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more\npotent than any they could raise—pains and pleasures so much more acute\nand exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to\ninflict or bestow—that their airs gave me no concern either for good or\nbad.\n\n“How is Mrs. Reed?” I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who\nthought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an\nunexpected liberty.\n\n“Mrs. Reed? Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you\ncan see her to-night.”\n\n“If,” said I, “you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I\nshould be much obliged to you.”\n\nGeorgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.\n“I know she had a particular wish to see me,” I added, “and I would not\ndefer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.”\n\n“Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,” remarked Eliza. I soon\nrose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I\nwould just step out to Bessie—who was, I dared say, in the kitchen—and\nask her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or\nnot to-night. I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my\nerrand, I proceeded to take further measures. It had heretofore been my\nhabit always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I\nshould, a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next\nmorning; now, it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a\nfoolish plan. I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt,\nand I must stay with her till she was better—or dead: as to her\ndaughters’ pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make myself\nindependent of it. So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me\na room, told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two,\nhad my trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself: I\nmet Bessie on the landing.\n\n“Missis is awake,” said she; “I have told her you are here: come and\nlet us see if she will know you.”\n\nI did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so\noften been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days. I\nhastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood\non the table, for it was now getting dark. There was the great\nfour-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table,\nthe armchair, and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been\nsentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted. I\nlooked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim\noutline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to\nleap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck. I\napproached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled\npillows.\n\nWell did I remember Mrs. Reed’s face, and I eagerly sought the familiar\nimage. It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance\nand hushes the promptings of rage and aversion. I had left this woman\nin bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other\nemotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong\nyearning to forget and forgive all injuries—to be reconciled and clasp\nhands in amity.\n\nThe well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever—there was that\npeculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,\nimperious, despotic eyebrow. How often had it lowered on me menace and\nhate! and how the recollection of childhood’s terrors and sorrows\nrevived as I traced its harsh line now! And yet I stooped down and\nkissed her: she looked at me.\n\n“Is this Jane Eyre?” she said.\n\n“Yes, Aunt Reed. How are you, dear aunt?”\n\nI had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it\nno sin to forget and break that vow now. My fingers had fastened on her\nhand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should\nat that moment have experienced true pleasure. But unimpressionable\nnatures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so\nreadily eradicated. Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face\nrather from me, she remarked that the night was warm. Again she\nregarded me so icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me—her feeling\ntowards me—was unchanged and unchangeable. I knew by her stony\neye—opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears—that she was resolved\nto consider me bad to the last; because to believe me good would give\nher no generous pleasure: only a sense of mortification.\n\nI felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to\nsubdue her—to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.\nMy tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their\nsource. I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over\nthe pillow.\n\n“You sent for me,” I said, “and I am here; and it is my intention to\nstay till I see how you get on.”\n\n“Oh, of course! You have seen my daughters?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things\nover with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a\ndifficulty in recalling them. But there was something I wished to\nsay—let me see—”\n\nThe wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken\nplace in her once vigorous frame. Turning restlessly, she drew the\nbedclothes round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed\nit down: she was at once irritated.\n\n“Sit up!” said she; “don’t annoy me with holding the clothes fast. Are\nyou Jane Eyre?”\n\n“I am Jane Eyre.”\n\n“I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.\nSuch a burden to be left on my hands—and so much annoyance as she\ncaused me, daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and\nher sudden starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of\none’s movements! I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or\nlike a fiend—no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to\nget her away from the house. What did they do with her at Lowood? The\nfever broke out there, and many of the pupils died. She, however, did\nnot die: but I said she did—I wish she had died!”\n\n“A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?”\n\n“I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband’s only\nsister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family’s\ndisowning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her\ndeath, he wept like a simpleton. He would send for the baby; though I\nentreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its\nmaintenance. I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it—a sickly,\nwhining, pining thing! It would wail in its cradle all night long—not\nscreaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning.\nReed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been\nhis own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age. He\nwould try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the\ndarlings could not bear it, and he was angry with them when they showed\ntheir dislike. In his last illness, he had it brought continually to\nhis bedside; and but an hour before he died, he bound me by vow to keep\nthe creature. I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out\nof a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak. John does not at all\nresemble his father, and I am glad of it: John is like me and like my\nbrothers—he is quite a Gibson. Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me\nwith letters for money! I have no more money to give him: we are\ngetting poor. I must send away half the servants and shut up part of\nthe house; or let it off. I can never submit to do that—yet how are we\nto get on? Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of\nmortgages. John gambles dreadfully, and always loses—poor boy! He is\nbeset by sharpers: John is sunk and degraded—his look is frightful—I\nfeel ashamed for him when I see him.”\n\nShe was getting much excited. “I think I had better leave her now,”\nsaid I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.\n\n“Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards\nnight—in the morning she is calmer.”\n\nI rose. “Stop!” exclaimed Mrs. Reed, “there is another thing I wished\nto say. He threatens me—he continually threatens me with his own death,\nor mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great\nwound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face. I am come to\na strange pass: I have heavy troubles. What is to be done? How is the\nmoney to be had?”\n\nBessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she\nsucceeded with difficulty. Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed,\nand sank into a dozing state. I then left her.\n\nMore than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with\nher. She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor\nforbade everything which could painfully excite her. Meantime, I got on\nas well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza. They were very cold,\nindeed, at first. Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or\nwriting, and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.\nGeorgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and\ntake no notice of me. But I was determined not to seem at a loss for\noccupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me,\nand they served me for both.\n\nProvided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to\ntake a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in\nsketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened\nmomentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of\nimagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a\nship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad’s\nhead, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in\na hedge-sparrow’s nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.\n\nOne morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to\nbe, I did not care or know. I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad\npoint, and worked away. Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and\nprominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour\ngave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with\nfeatures. Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that\nbrow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight\nridge and full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means\nnarrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it:\nof course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted\non the temples, and waved above the forehead. Now for the eyes: I had\nleft them to the last, because they required the most careful working.\nI drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and\nsombre; the irids lustrous and large. “Good! but not quite the thing,”\nI thought, as I surveyed the effect: “they want more force and spirit;”\nand I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more\nbrilliantly—a happy touch or two secured success. There, I had a\nfriend’s face under my gaze; and what did it signify that those young\nladies turned their backs on me? I looked at it; I smiled at the\nspeaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.\n\n“Is that a portrait of some one you know?” asked Eliza, who had\napproached me unnoticed. I responded that it was merely a fancy head,\nand hurried it beneath the other sheets. Of course, I lied: it was, in\nfact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester. But what was\nthat to her, or to any one but myself? Georgiana also advanced to look.\nThe other drawings pleased her much, but she called that “an ugly man.”\nThey both seemed surprised at my skill. I offered to sketch their\nportraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline. Then Georgiana\nproduced her album. I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing:\nthis put her at once into good humour. She proposed a walk in the\ngrounds. Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a\nconfidential conversation: she had favoured me with a description of\nthe brilliant winter she had spent in London two seasons ago—of the\nadmiration she had there excited—the attention she had received; and I\neven got hints of the titled conquest she had made. In the course of\nthe afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on: various soft\nconversations were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and,\nin short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day\nimprovised by her for my benefit. The communications were renewed from\nday to day: they always ran on the same theme—herself, her loves, and\nwoes. It was strange she never once adverted either to her mother’s\nillness, or her brother’s death, or the present gloomy state of the\nfamily prospects. Her mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of\npast gaiety, and aspirations after dissipations to come. She passed\nabout five minutes each day in her mother’s sick-room, and no more.\n\nEliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk. I never\nsaw a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say\nwhat she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence. She\nhad an alarm to call her up early. I know not how she occupied herself\nbefore breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular\nportions, and each hour had its allotted task. Three times a day she\nstudied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common\nPrayer Book. I asked her once what was the great attraction of that\nvolume, and she said, “the Rubric.” Three hours she gave to stitching,\nwith gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large\nenough for a carpet. In answer to my inquiries after the use of this\narticle, she informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new\nchurch lately erected near Gateshead. Two hours she devoted to her\ndiary; two to working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the\nregulation of her accounts. She seemed to want no company; no\nconversation. I believe she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed\nfor her; and nothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any\nincident which forced her to vary its clockwork regularity.\n\nShe told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than\nusual, that John’s conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had\nbeen a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,\nsettled her mind, and formed her resolution. Her own fortune she had\ntaken care to secure; and when her mother died—and it was wholly\nimprobable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or\nlinger long—she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a\nretirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from\ndisturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous\nworld. I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.\n\n“Of course not. Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had\nhad. She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.\nGeorgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.”\n\nGeorgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time\nin lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and\nwishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an\ninvitation up to town. “It would be so much better,” she said, “if she\ncould only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.” I\ndid not ask what she meant by “all being over,” but I suppose she\nreferred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of\nfuneral rites. Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister’s\nindolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had\nbeen before her. One day, however, as she put away her account-book and\nunfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus—\n\n“Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never\nallowed to cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for you make\nno use of life. Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a\nreasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some\nother person’s strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her\nor himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out\nthat you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable. Then, too, existence\nfor you must be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the\nworld is a dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must\nbe flattered—you must have music, dancing, and society—or you languish,\nyou die away. Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you\nindependent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own? Take one day;\nshare it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no\nstray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes—include\nall; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid\nregularity. The day will close almost before you are aware it has\nbegun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one\nvacant moment: you have had to seek no one’s company, conversation,\nsympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent\nbeing ought to do. Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer\nyou; then you will not want me or any one else, happen what may.\nNeglect it—go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling—and suffer\nthe results of your idiocy, however bad and insufferable they may be. I\ntell you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat\nwhat I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it. After my\nmother’s death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is\ncarried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate\nas if we had never known each other. You need not think that because we\nchanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me\ndown by even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this—if the whole human\nrace, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on\nthe earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the\nnew.”\n\nShe closed her lips.\n\n“You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,”\nanswered Georgiana. “Everybody knows you are the most selfish,\nheartless creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred\ntowards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played\nme about Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you,\nto have a title, to be received into circles where you dare not show\nyour face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my\nprospects for ever.” Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her\nnose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and\nassiduously industrious.\n\nTrue, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were\ntwo natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably\nsavourless for the want of it. Feeling without judgment is a washy\ndraught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and\nhusky a morsel for human deglutition.\n\nIt was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the\nsofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a\nsaint’s-day service at the new church—for in matters of religion she\nwas a rigid formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge\nof what she considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to\nchurch thrice every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were\nprayers.\n\nI bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who\nlay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent\nattention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out\nof the room whenever she could. Bessie was faithful; but she had her\nown family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall. I\nfound the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there;\nthe patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in\nthe pillows: the fire was dying in the grate. I renewed the fuel,\nre-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze\non me, and then I moved away to the window.\n\nThe rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:\n“One lies there,” I thought, “who will soon be beyond the war of\nearthly elements. Whither will that spirit—now struggling to quit its\nmaterial tenement—flit when at length released?”\n\nIn pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her\ndying words—her faith—her doctrine of the equality of disembodied\nsouls. I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered\ntones—still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face\nand sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her\nlonging to be restored to her divine Father’s bosom—when a feeble voice\nmurmured from the couch behind: “Who is that?”\n\nI knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving? I went up\nto her.\n\n“It is I, Aunt Reed.”\n\n“Who—I?” was her answer. “Who are you?” looking at me with surprise and\na sort of alarm, but still not wildly. “You are quite a stranger to\nme—where is Bessie?”\n\n“She is at the lodge, aunt.”\n\n“Aunt,” she repeated. “Who calls me aunt? You are not one of the\nGibsons; and yet I know you—that face, and the eyes and forehead, are\nquiet familiar to me: you are like—why, you are like Jane Eyre!”\n\nI said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my\nidentity.\n\n“Yet,” said she, “I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.\nI wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:\nbesides, in eight years she must be so changed.” I now gently assured\nher that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing\nthat I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I\nexplained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.\n\n“I am very ill, I know,” she said ere long. “I was trying to turn\nmyself a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb. It is as\nwell I should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in\nhealth, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me. Is the\nnurse here? or is there no one in the room but you?”\n\nI assured her we were alone.\n\n“Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now. One was in\nbreaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own\nchild; the other—” she stopped. “After all, it is of no great\nimportance, perhaps,” she murmured to herself: “and then I may get\nbetter; and to humble myself so to her is painful.”\n\nShe made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;\nshe seemed to experience some inward sensation—the precursor, perhaps,\nof the last pang.\n\n“Well, I must get it over. Eternity is before me: I had better tell\nher.—Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will\nsee there.”\n\nI obeyed her directions. “Read the letter,” she said.\n\nIt was short, and thus conceived:—\n\n“MADAM,—\n“Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane\nEyre, and to tell me how she is? It is my intention to write shortly\nand desire her to come to me at Madeira. Providence has blessed my\nendeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried and childless,\nI wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at my death\nwhatever I may have to leave.\n\n\nI am, Madam, &c., &c.,\n“JOHN EYRE, Madeira.”\n\n\nIt was dated three years back.\n\n“Why did I never hear of this?” I asked.\n\n“Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand\nin lifting you to prosperity. I could not forget your conduct to me,\nJane—the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you\ndeclared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the\nunchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very\nthought of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with\nmiserable cruelty. I could not forget my own sensations when you thus\nstarted up and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an\nanimal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes\nand cursed me in a man’s voice.—Bring me some water! Oh, make haste!”\n\n“Dear Mrs. Reed,” said I, as I offered her the draught she required,\n“think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind. Forgive me\nfor my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have\npassed since that day.”\n\nShe heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water\nand drawn breath, she went on thus—\n\n“I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be\nadopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was\nwhat I could not endure. I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his\ndisappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at\nLowood. Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion—expose\nmy falsehood as soon as you like. You were born, I think, to be my\ntorment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which,\nbut for you, I should never have been tempted to commit.”\n\n“If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to\nregard me with kindness and forgiveness——”\n\n“You have a very bad disposition,” said she, “and one to this day I\nfeel it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be\npatient and quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out\nall fire and violence, I can never comprehend.”\n\n“My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not\nvindictive. Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to\nlove you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be\nreconciled to you now: kiss me, aunt.”\n\nI approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it. She said I\noppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water. As I\nlaid her down—for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she\ndrank—I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble\nfingers shrank from my touch—the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.\n\n“Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,” I said at last, “you have my\nfull and free forgiveness: ask now for God’s, and be at peace.”\n\nPoor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort\nto change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated\nme—dying, she must hate me still.\n\nThe nurse now entered, and Bessie followed. I yet lingered half-an-hour\nlonger, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none. She was\nfast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve\no’clock that night she died. I was not present to close her eyes, nor\nwere either of her daughters. They came to tell us the next morning\nthat all was over. She was by that time laid out. Eliza and I went to\nlook at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she\ndared not go. There was stretched Sarah Reed’s once robust and active\nframe, rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid;\nher brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.\nA strange and solemn object was that corpse to me. I gazed on it with\ngloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or\nhopeful, or subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_\nwoes—not _my_ loss—and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of\ndeath in such a form.\n\nEliza surveyed her parent calmly. After a silence of some minutes she\nobserved—\n\n“With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her\nlife was shortened by trouble.” And then a spasm constricted her mouth\nfor an instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so\ndid I. Neither of us had dropt a tear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nMr. Rochester had given me but one week’s leave of absence: yet a month\nelapsed before I quitted Gateshead. I wished to leave immediately after\nthe funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off\nto London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr.\nGibson, who had come down to direct his sister’s interment and settle\nthe family affairs. Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with\nEliza; from her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in\nher fears, nor aid in her preparations; so I bore with her\nfeeble-minded wailings and selfish lamentations as well as I could, and\ndid my best in sewing for her and packing her dresses. It is true, that\nwhile I worked, she would idle; and I thought to myself, “If you and I\nwere destined to live always together, cousin, we would commence\nmatters on a different footing. I should not settle tamely down into\nbeing the forbearing party; I should assign you your share of labour,\nand compel you to accomplish it, or else it should be left undone: I\nshould insist, also, on your keeping some of those drawling,\nhalf-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast. It is only because\nour connection happens to be very transitory, and comes at a peculiarly\nmournful season, that I consent thus to render it so patient and\ncompliant on my part.”\n\nAt last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza’s turn to request me\nto stay another week. Her plans required all her time and attention,\nshe said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day\nlong she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling\ntrunks, emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication\nwith any one. She wished me to look after the house, to see callers,\nand answer notes of condolence.\n\nOne morning she told me I was at liberty. “And,” she added, “I am\nobliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct! There\nis some difference between living with such an one as you and with\nGeorgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.\nTo-morrow,” she continued, “I set out for the Continent. I shall take\nup my abode in a religious house near Lisle—a nunnery you would call\nit; there I shall be quiet and unmolested. I shall devote myself for a\ntime to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful\nstudy of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half\nsuspect it is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all\nthings decently and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and\nprobably take the veil.”\n\nI neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to\ndissuade her from it. “The vocation will fit you to a hair,” I thought:\n“much good may it do you!”\n\nWhen we parted, she said: “Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:\nyou have some sense.”\n\nI then returned: “You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you\nhave, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French\nconvent. However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don’t\nmuch care.”\n\n“You are in the right,” said she; and with these words we each went our\nseparate way. As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or\nher sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an\nadvantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that\nEliza actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the\nconvent where she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she\nendowed with her fortune.\n\nHow people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or\nshort, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation. I had\nknown what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long\nwalk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was\nto come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a\ngood fire, and to be unable to get either. Neither of these returnings\nwas very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,\nincreasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came. The return\nto Thornfield was yet to be tried.\n\nMy journey seemed tedious—very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night\nspent at an inn; fifty miles the next day. During the first twelve\nhours I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured\nand discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice. I mused on\nthe funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and\nservants—few was the number of relatives—the gaping vault, the silent\nchurch, the solemn service. Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I\nbeheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a\nconvent cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities\nof person and character. The evening arrival at the great town of ——\nscattered these thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down\non my traveller’s bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.\n\nI was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there? Not\nlong; of that I was sure. I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim\nof my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had\nleft for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in\na fortnight. Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make\narrangements for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new\ncarriage: she said the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed\nstrange to her; but from what everybody said, and from what she had\nherself seen, she could no longer doubt that the event would shortly\ntake place. “You would be strangely incredulous if you did doubt it,”\nwas my mental comment. “I don’t doubt it.”\n\nThe question followed, “Where was I to go?” I dreamt of Miss Ingram all\nthe night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of\nThornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr.\nRochester looked on with his arms folded—smiling sardonically, as it\nseemed, at both her and me.\n\nI had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I\ndid not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote. I proposed\nto walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving\nmy box in the ostler’s care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about\nsix o’clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a\nroad which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.\n\nIt was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft:\nthe haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far\nfrom cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its\nblue—where blue was visible—was mild and settled, and its cloud strata\nhigh and thin. The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it—it\nseemed as if there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen\nof marbled vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.\n\nI felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped\nonce to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it\nwas not to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to\na place where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.\n“Mrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure,” said I; “and\nlittle Adèle will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very\nwell you are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking\nof you.”\n\nBut what is so headstrong as youth? What so blind as inexperience?\nThese affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of\nagain looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and\nthey added—“Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more\ndays or weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!” And then\nI strangled a new-born agony—a deformed thing which I could not\npersuade myself to own and rear—and ran on.\n\nThey are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the\nlabourers are just quitting their work, and returning home with their\nrakes on their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive. I have but a field\nor two to traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the\ngates. How full the hedges are of roses! But I have no time to gather\nany; I want to be at the house. I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy\nand flowery branches across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone\nsteps; and I see—Mr. Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in\nhis hand; he is writing.\n\nWell, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a\nmoment I am beyond my own mastery. What does it mean? I did not think I\nshould tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the\npower of motion in his presence. I will go back as soon as I can stir:\nI need not make an absolute fool of myself. I know another way to the\nhouse. It does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.\n\n“Hillo!” he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil. “There you\nare! Come on, if you please.”\n\nI suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being\nscarcely cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm;\nand, above all, to control the working muscles of my face—which I feel\nrebel insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had\nresolved to conceal. But I have a veil—it is down: I may make shift yet\nto behave with decent composure.\n\n“And this is Jane Eyre? Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?\nYes—just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come\nclattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into\nthe vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a\ndream or a shade. What the deuce have you done with yourself this last\nmonth?”\n\n“I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead.”\n\n“A true Janian reply! Good angels be my guard! She comes from the other\nworld—from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she\nmeets me alone here in the gloaming! If I dared, I’d touch you, to see\nif you are substance or shadow, you elf!—but I’d as soon offer to take\nhold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh. Truant! truant!” he\nadded, when he had paused an instant. “Absent from me a whole month,\nand forgetting me quite, I’ll be sworn!”\n\nI knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though\nbroken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by\nthe knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.\nRochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of\ncommunicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered\nto stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially. His last\nwords were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him\nwhether I forgot him or not. And he had spoken of Thornfield as my\nhome—would that it were my home!\n\nHe did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by. I\ninquired soon if he had not been to London.\n\n“Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight.”\n\n“Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter.”\n\n“And did she inform you what I went to do?”\n\n“Oh, yes, sir! Everybody knew your errand.”\n\n“You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don’t think it\nwill suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won’t look like Queen\nBoadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions. I wish, Jane, I\nwere a trifle better adapted to match with her externally. Tell me now,\nfairy as you are—can’t you give me a charm, or a philter, or something\nof that sort, to make me a handsome man?”\n\n“It would be past the power of magic, sir;” and, in thought, I added,\n“A loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough;\nor rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty.”\n\nMr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to\nme incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my\nabrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had\nof his own, and which he used but on rare occasions. He seemed to think\nit too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling—he\nshed it over me now.\n\n“Pass, Janet,” said he, making room for me to cross the stile: “go up\nhome, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend’s\nthreshold.”\n\nAll I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to\ncolloquise further. I got over the stile without a word, and meant to\nleave him calmly. An impulse held me fast—a force turned me round. I\nsaid—or something in me said for me, and in spite of me—\n\n“Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am strangely glad\nto get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home—my only\nhome.”\n\nI walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he\ntried. Little Adèle was half wild with delight when she saw me. Mrs.\nFairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness. Leah smiled, and\neven Sophie bid me “bon soir” with glee. This was very pleasant; there\nis no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and\nfeeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.\n\nI that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my\nears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and\ncoming grief. When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her\nknitting, and I had assumed a low seat near her, and Adèle, kneeling on\nthe carpet, had nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection\nseemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent\nprayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus\nsat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to\ntake pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable—when he said he\nsupposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted\ndaughter back again, and added that he saw Adèle was “prête à croquer\nsa petite maman Anglaise”—I half ventured to hope that he would, even\nafter his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his\nprotection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.\n\nA fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.\nNothing was said of the master’s marriage, and I saw no preparation\ngoing on for such an event. Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if\nshe had yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the\nnegative. Once she said she had actually put the question to Mr.\nRochester as to when he was going to bring his bride home; but he had\nanswered her only by a joke and one of his queer looks, and she could\nnot tell what to make of him.\n\nOne thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no\njourneyings backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure\nit was twenty miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was\nthat distance to an ardent lover? To so practised and indefatigable a\nhorseman as Mr. Rochester, it would be but a morning’s ride. I began to\ncherish hopes I had no right to conceive: that the match was broken\noff; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or both parties had\nchanged their minds. I used to look at my master’s face to see if it\nwere sad or fierce; but I could not remember the time when it had been\nso uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings. If, in the moments I and\nmy pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable\ndejection, he became even gay. Never had he called me more frequently\nto his presence; never been kinder to me when there—and, alas! never\nhad I loved him so well.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nA splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant\nas were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our\nwave-girt land. It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the\nSouth, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest\nthem on the cliffs of Albion. The hay was all got in; the fields round\nThornfield were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees\nwere in their dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply\ntinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows\nbetween.\n\nOn Midsummer-eve, Adèle, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay\nLane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun. I watched her drop\nasleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.\n\nIt was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:—“Day its fervid fires\nhad wasted,” and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.\nWhere the sun had gone down in simple state—pure of the pomp of\nclouds—spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and\nfurnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and\nwide, soft and still softer, over half heaven. The east had its own\ncharm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a rising and solitary\nstar: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the\nhorizon.\n\nI walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent—that\nof a cigar—stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a\nhandbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the\norchard. No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it\nwas full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it\nout from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened\nit from the lawn. At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation\nfrom lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and\nterminating in a giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat,\nled down to the fence. Here one could wander unseen. While such\nhoney-dew fell, such silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as\nif I could haunt such shade for ever; but in threading the flower and\nfruit parterres at the upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by\nthe light the now rising moon cast on this more open quarter, my step\nis stayed—not by sound, not by sight, but once more by a warning\nfragrance.\n\nSweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been\nyielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither\nof shrub nor flower; it is—I know it well—it is Mr. Rochester’s cigar.\nI look round and I listen. I see trees laden with ripening fruit. I\nhear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form\nis visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must\nflee. I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr.\nRochester entering. I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay\nlong: he will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will\nnever see me.\n\nBut no—eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden\nas attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree\nbranches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are\nladen; now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a\nknot of flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the\ndew-beads on their petals. A great moth goes humming by me; it alights\non a plant at Mr. Rochester’s foot: he sees it, and bends to examine\nit.\n\n“Now, he has his back towards me,” thought I, “and he is occupied too;\nperhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed.”\n\nI trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel\nmight not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two\ndistant from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him. “I\nshall get by very well,” I meditated. As I crossed his shadow, thrown\nlong over the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly,\nwithout turning—\n\n“Jane, come and look at this fellow.”\n\nI had made no noise: he had not eyes behind—could his shadow feel? I\nstarted at first, and then I approached him.\n\n“Look at his wings,” said he, “he reminds me rather of a West Indian\ninsect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in\nEngland; there! he is flown.”\n\nThe moth roamed away. I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.\nRochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said—\n\n“Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and\nsurely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting\nwith moonrise.”\n\nIt is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt\nenough at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing\nan excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile\nword or plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful\nembarrassment. I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.\nRochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to\nallege for leaving him. I followed with lagging step, and thoughts\nbusily bent on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself\nlooked so composed and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any\nconfusion: the evil—if evil existent or prospective there was—seemed to\nlie with me only; his mind was unconscious and quiet.\n\n“Jane,” he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly\nstrayed down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,\n“Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“You must have become in some degree attached to the house,—you, who\nhave an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of\nAdhesiveness?”\n\n“I am attached to it, indeed.”\n\n“And though I don’t comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired\na degree of regard for that foolish little child Adèle, too; and even\nfor simple dame Fairfax?”\n\n“Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both.”\n\n“And would be sorry to part with them?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Pity!” he said, and sighed and paused. “It is always the way of events\nin this life,” he continued presently: “no sooner have you got settled\nin a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and\nmove on, for the hour of repose is expired.”\n\n“Must I move on, sir?” I asked. “Must I leave Thornfield?”\n\n“I believe you must, Jane. I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you\nmust.”\n\nThis was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.\n\n“Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes.”\n\n“It is come now—I must give it to-night.”\n\n“Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?”\n\n“Ex-act-ly—pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the\nnail straight on the head.”\n\n“Soon, sir?”\n\n“Very soon, my—that is, Miss Eyre: and you’ll remember, Jane, the first\ntime I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to\nput my old bachelor’s neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the\nholy estate of matrimony—to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short\n(she’s an extensive armful: but that’s not to the point—one can’t have\ntoo much of such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well,\nas I was saying—listen to me, Jane! You’re not turning your head to\nlook after more moths, are you? That was only a lady-clock, child,\n‘flying away home.’ I wish to remind you that it was you who first said\nto me, with that discretion I respect in you—with that foresight,\nprudence, and humility which befit your responsible and dependent\nposition—that in case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adèle\nhad better trot forthwith. I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in\nthis suggestion on the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are\nfar away, Janet, I’ll try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom;\nwhich is such that I have made it my law of action. Adèle must go to\nschool; and you, Miss Eyre, must get a new situation.”\n\n“Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose—” I\nwas going to say, “I suppose I may stay here, till I find another\nshelter to betake myself to:” but I stopped, feeling it would not do to\nrisk a long sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.\n\n“In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom,” continued Mr. Rochester;\n“and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an\nasylum for you.”\n\n“Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give—”\n\n“Oh, no need to apologise! I consider that when a dependent does her\nduty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her\nemployer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her;\nindeed I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a\nplace that I think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the\nfive daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O’Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,\nIreland. You’ll like Ireland, I think: they’re such warm-hearted people\nthere, they say.”\n\n“It is a long way off, sir.”\n\n“No matter—a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the\ndistance.”\n\n“Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier—”\n\n“From what, Jane?”\n\n“From England and from Thornfield: and—”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“From _you_, sir.”\n\nI said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free\nwill, my tears gushed out. I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I\navoided sobbing. The thought of Mrs. O’Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck\ncold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,\ndestined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side\nI now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean—wealth,\ncaste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably\nloved.\n\n“It is a long way,” I again said.\n\n“It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,\nIreland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that’s morally certain. I\nnever go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the\ncountry. We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the\nlittle time that remains to them close to each other. Come! we’ll talk\nover the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the\nstars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the\nchestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots. Come, we will sit\nthere in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit\nthere together.” He seated me and himself.\n\n“It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little\nfriend on such weary travels: but if I can’t do better, how is it to be\nhelped? Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?”\n\nI could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.\n\n“Because,” he said, “I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to\nyou—especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string\nsomewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a\nsimilar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little\nframe. And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of\nland come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be\nsnapt; and then I’ve a nervous notion I should take to bleeding\ninwardly. As for you,—you’d forget me.”\n\n“That I _never_ should, sir: you know—” Impossible to proceed.\n\n“Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood? Listen!”\n\nIn listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured\nno longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot\nwith acute distress. When I did speak, it was only to express an\nimpetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.\n\n“Because you are sorry to leave it?”\n\nThe vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was\nclaiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right\nto predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,—and\nto speak.\n\n“I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:—I love it, because I\nhave lived in it a full and delightful life,—momentarily at least. I\nhave not been trampled on. I have not been petrified. I have not been\nburied with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of\ncommunion with what is bright and energetic and high. I have talked,\nface to face, with what I reverence, with what I delight in,—with an\noriginal, a vigorous, an expanded mind. I have known you, Mr.\nRochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I\nabsolutely must be torn from you for ever. I see the necessity of\ndeparture; and it is like looking on the necessity of death.”\n\n“Where do you see the necessity?” he asked suddenly.\n\n“Where? You, sir, have placed it before me.”\n\n“In what shape?”\n\n“In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,—your bride.”\n\n“My bride! What bride? I have no bride!”\n\n“But you will have.”\n\n“Yes;—I will!—I will!” He set his teeth.\n\n“Then I must go:—you have said it yourself.”\n\n“No: you must stay! I swear it—and the oath shall be kept.”\n\n“I tell you I must go!” I retorted, roused to something like passion.\n“Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I am an\nautomaton?—a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel\nof bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from\nmy cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I\nam soulless and heartless? You think wrong!—I have as much soul as\nyou,—and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty\nand much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as\nit is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the\nmedium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;—it is my\nspirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through\nthe grave, and we stood at God’s feet, equal,—as we are!”\n\n“As we are!” repeated Mr. Rochester—“so,” he added, enclosing me in his\narms, gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: “so,\nJane!”\n\n“Yes, so, sir,” I rejoined: “and yet not so; for you are a married\nman—or as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you—to one\nwith whom you have no sympathy—whom I do not believe you truly love;\nfor I have seen and heard you sneer at her. I would scorn such a union:\ntherefore I am better than you—let me go!”\n\n“Where, Jane? To Ireland?”\n\n“Yes—to Ireland. I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now.”\n\n“Jane, be still; don’t struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is\nrending its own plumage in its desperation.”\n\n“I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an\nindependent will, which I now exert to leave you.”\n\nAnother effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.\n\n“And your will shall decide your destiny,” he said: “I offer you my\nhand, my heart, and a share of all my possessions.”\n\n“You play a farce, which I merely laugh at.”\n\n“I ask you to pass through life at my side—to be my second self, and\nbest earthly companion.”\n\n“For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by\nit.”\n\n“Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still\ntoo.”\n\nA waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through\nthe boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away—away—to an indefinite\ndistance—it died. The nightingale’s song was then the only voice of the\nhour: in listening to it, I again wept. Mr. Rochester sat quiet,\nlooking at me gently and seriously. Some time passed before he spoke;\nhe at last said—\n\n“Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another.”\n\n“I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot\nreturn.”\n\n“But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry.”\n\nI was silent: I thought he mocked me.\n\n“Come, Jane—come hither.”\n\n“Your bride stands between us.”\n\nHe rose, and with a stride reached me.\n\n“My bride is here,” he said, again drawing me to him, “because my equal\nis here, and my likeness. Jane, will you marry me?”\n\nStill I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for\nI was still incredulous.\n\n“Do you doubt me, Jane?”\n\n“Entirely.”\n\n“You have no faith in me?”\n\n“Not a whit.”\n\n“Am I a liar in your eyes?” he asked passionately. “Little sceptic, you\n_shall_ be convinced. What love have I for Miss Ingram? None: and that\nyou know. What love has she for me? None: as I have taken pains to\nprove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third\nof what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the\nresult; it was coldness both from her and her mother. I would not—I\ncould not—marry Miss Ingram. You—you strange, you almost unearthly\nthing!—I love as my own flesh. You—poor and obscure, and small and\nplain as you are—I entreat to accept me as a husband.”\n\n“What, me!” I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness—and especially\nin his incivility—to credit his sincerity: “me who have not a friend in\nthe world but you—if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you\nhave given me?”\n\n“You, Jane, I must have you for my own—entirely my own. Will you be\nmine? Say yes, quickly.”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I want to read your countenance—turn!”\n\n“There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled,\nscratched page. Read on: only make haste, for I suffer.”\n\nHis face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were\nstrong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.\n\n“Oh, Jane, you torture me!” he exclaimed. “With that searching and yet\nfaithful and generous look, you torture me!”\n\n“How can I do that? If you are true, and your offer real, my only\nfeelings to you must be gratitude and devotion—they cannot torture.”\n\n“Gratitude!” he ejaculated; and added wildly—“Jane accept me quickly.\nSay, Edward—give me my name—Edward—I will marry you.”\n\n“Are you in earnest? Do you truly love me? Do you sincerely wish me to\nbe your wife?”\n\n“I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it.”\n\n“Then, sir, I will marry you.”\n\n“Edward—my little wife!”\n\n“Dear Edward!”\n\n“Come to me—come to me entirely now,” said he; and added, in his\ndeepest tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, “Make\nmy happiness—I will make yours.”\n\n“God pardon me!” he subjoined ere long; “and man meddle not with me: I\nhave her, and will hold her.”\n\n“There is no one to meddle, sir. I have no kindred to interfere.”\n\n“No—that is the best of it,” he said. And if I had loved him less I\nshould have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,\nsitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting—called to the\nparadise of union—I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so\nabundant a flow. Again and again he said, “Are you happy, Jane?” And\nagain and again I answered, “Yes.” After which he murmured, “It will\natone—it will atone. Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and\ncomfortless? Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her? Is there\nnot love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves? It will expiate at\nGod’s tribunal. I know my Maker sanctions what I do. For the world’s\njudgment—I wash my hands thereof. For man’s opinion—I defy it.”\n\nBut what had befallen the night? The moon was not yet set, and we were\nall in shadow: I could scarcely see my master’s face, near as I was.\nAnd what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind\nroared in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.\n\n“We must go in,” said Mr. Rochester: “the weather changes. I could have\nsat with thee till morning, Jane.”\n\n“And so,” thought I, “could I with you.” I should have said so,\nperhaps, but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was\nlooking, and there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and\nI thought only of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester’s\nshoulder.\n\nThe rain rushed down. He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,\nand into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the\nthreshold. He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the\nwater out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.\nI did not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester. The lamp was\nlit. The clock was on the stroke of twelve.\n\n“Hasten to take off your wet things,” said he; “and before you go,\ngood-night—good-night, my darling!”\n\nHe kissed me repeatedly. When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there\nstood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed. I only smiled at her, and ran\nupstairs. “Explanation will do for another time,” thought I. Still,\nwhen I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even\ntemporarily misconstrue what she had seen. But joy soon effaced every\nother feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder\ncrashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as\nthe rain fell during a storm of two hours’ duration, I experienced no\nfear and little awe. Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course\nof it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that\nwas strength for anything.\n\nBefore I left my bed in the morning, little Adèle came running in to\ntell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had\nbeen struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nAs I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered\nif it were a dream. I could not be certain of the reality till I had\nseen Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and\npromise.\n\nWhile arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it\nwas no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its\ncolour; and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition,\nand borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple. I had often been unwilling\nto look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my\nlook; but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his\naffection by its expression. I took a plain but clean and light summer\ndress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so\nwell become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.\n\nI was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a\nbrilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and\nto feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and\nfragrant breeze. Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy. A\nbeggar-woman and her little boy—pale, ragged objects both—were coming\nup the walk, and I ran down and gave them all the money I happened to\nhave in my purse—some three or four shillings: good or bad, they must\npartake of my jubilee. The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but\nnothing was so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing heart.\n\nMrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad\ncountenance, and saying gravely—“Miss Eyre, will you come to\nbreakfast?” During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not\nundeceive her then. I must wait for my master to give explanations; and\nso must she. I ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs. I met\nAdèle leaving the schoolroom.\n\n“Where are you going? It is time for lessons.”\n\n“Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery.”\n\n“Where is he?”\n\n“In there,” pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and\nthere he stood.\n\n“Come and bid me good-morning,” said he. I gladly advanced; and it was\nnot merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I\nreceived, but an embrace and a kiss. It seemed natural: it seemed\ngenial to be so well loved, so caressed by him.\n\n“Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty,” said he: “truly\npretty this morning. Is this my pale, little elf? Is this my\nmustard-seed? This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and\nrosy lips; the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?” (I\nhad green eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they\nwere new-dyed, I suppose.)\n\n“It is Jane Eyre, sir.”\n\n“Soon to be Jane Rochester,” he added: “in four weeks, Janet; not a day\nmore. Do you hear that?”\n\nI did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy. The\nfeeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than\nwas consistent with joy—something that smote and stunned: it was, I\nthink almost fear.\n\n“You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?”\n\n“Because you gave me a new name—Jane Rochester; and it seems so\nstrange.”\n\n“Yes, Mrs. Rochester,” said he; “young Mrs. Rochester—Fairfax\nRochester’s girl-bride.”\n\n“It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely. Human beings never\nenjoy complete happiness in this world. I was not born for a different\ndestiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me\nis a fairy tale—a day-dream.”\n\n“Which I can and will realise. I shall begin to-day. This morning I\nwrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his\nkeeping,—heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield. In a day or two I hope\nto pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall\nbe yours that I would accord a peer’s daughter, if about to marry her.”\n\n“Oh, sir!—never rain jewels! I don’t like to hear them spoken of.\nJewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not\nhave them.”\n\n“I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet\non your forehead,—which it will become: for nature, at least, has\nstamped her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the\nbracelets on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with\nrings.”\n\n“No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and\nin another strain. Don’t address me as if I were a beauty; I am your\nplain, Quakerish governess.”\n\n“You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my\nheart,—delicate and aërial.”\n\n“Puny and insignificant, you mean. You are dreaming, sir,—or you are\nsneering. For God’s sake, don’t be ironical!”\n\n“I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too,” he went on,\nwhile I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I\nfelt he was either deluding himself or trying to delude me. “I will\nattire my Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair;\nand I will cover the head I love best with a priceless veil.”\n\n“And then you won’t know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any\nlonger, but an ape in a harlequin’s jacket—a jay in borrowed plumes. I\nwould as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings,\nas myself clad in a court-lady’s robe; and I don’t call you handsome,\nsir, though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.\nDon’t flatter me.”\n\nHe pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation. “This\nvery day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must\nchoose some dresses for yourself. I told you we shall be married in\nfour weeks. The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down\nbelow yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town. After a\nbrief stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun:\nto French vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is\nfamous in old story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the\nlife of cities; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison\nwith others.”\n\n“Shall I travel?—and with you, sir?”\n\n“You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and\nVienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:\nwherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph’s foot shall step also. Ten\nyears since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and\nrage as my companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with\na very angel as my comforter.”\n\nI laughed at him as he said this. “I am not an angel,” I asserted; “and\nI will not be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr. Rochester, you must\nneither expect nor exact anything celestial of me—for you will not get\nit, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all\nanticipate.”\n\n“What do you anticipate of me?”\n\n“For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,—a very little\nwhile; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious;\nand then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you:\nbut when you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me\nagain,—_like_ me, I say, not _love_ me. I suppose your love will\neffervesce in six months, or less. I have observed in books written by\nmen, that period assigned as the farthest to which a husband’s ardour\nextends. Yet, after all, as a friend and companion, I hope never to\nbecome quite distasteful to my dear master.”\n\n“Distasteful! and like you again! I think I shall like you again, and\nyet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_\nyou—with truth, fervour, constancy.”\n\n“Yet are you not capricious, sir?”\n\n“To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I\nfind out they have neither souls nor hearts—when they open to me a\nperspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility,\ncoarseness, and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue,\nto the soul made of fire, and the character that bends but does not\nbreak—at once supple and stable, tractable and consistent—I am ever\ntender and true.”\n\n“Had you ever experience of such a character, sir? Did you ever love\nsuch an one?”\n\n“I love it now.”\n\n“But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult\nstandard?”\n\n“I never met your likeness. Jane, you please me, and you master me—you\nseem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I\nam twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up\nmy arm to my heart. I am influenced—conquered; and the influence is\nsweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery\nbeyond any triumph I can win. Why do you smile, Jane? What does that\ninexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?”\n\n“I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I\nwas thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers—”\n\n“You were, you little elfish—”\n\n“Hush, sir! You don’t talk very wisely just now; any more than those\ngentlemen acted very wisely. However, had they been married, they would\nno doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness\nas suitors; and so will you, I fear. I wonder how you will answer me a\nyear hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or\npleasure to grant.”\n\n“Ask me something now, Janet,—the least thing: I desire to be\nentreated—”\n\n“Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready.”\n\n“Speak! But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall\nswear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of\nme.”\n\n“Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don’t send for the jewels, and don’t\ncrown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round\nthat plain pocket handkerchief you have there.”\n\n“I might as well ‘gild refined gold.’ I know it: your request is\ngranted then—for the time. I will remand the order I despatched to my\nbanker. But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift\nto be withdrawn: try again.”\n\n“Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is\nmuch piqued on one point.”\n\nHe looked disturbed. “What? what?” he said hastily. “Curiosity is a\ndangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every\nrequest—”\n\n“But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir.”\n\n“Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into,\nperhaps, a secret, it was a wish for half my estate.”\n\n“Now, King Ahasuerus! What do I want with half your estate? Do you\nthink I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land? I would much\nrather have all your confidence. You will not exclude me from your\nconfidence if you admit me to your heart?”\n\n“You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but\nfor God’s sake, don’t desire a useless burden! Don’t long for\npoison—don’t turn out a downright Eve on my hands!”\n\n“Why not, sir? You have just been telling me how much you liked to be\nconquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you. Don’t you think\nI had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and\nentreat—even cry and be sulky if necessary—for the sake of a mere essay\nof my power?”\n\n“I dare you to any such experiment. Encroach, presume, and the game is\nup.”\n\n“Is it, sir? You soon give in. How stern you look now! Your eyebrows\nhave become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in\nsome very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, ‘a blue-piled\nthunderloft.’ That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?”\n\n“If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give\nup the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander. But what\nhad you to ask, thing,—out with it?”\n\n“There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal\nbetter than flattery. I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel. This is\nwhat I have to ask,—Why did you take such pains to make me believe you\nwished to marry Miss Ingram?”\n\n“Is that all? Thank God it is no worse!” And now he unknit his black\nbrows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well\npleased at seeing a danger averted. “I think I may confess,” he\ncontinued, “even although I should make you a little indignant,\nJane—and I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are\nindignant. You glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you\nmutinied against fate, and claimed your rank as my equal. Janet,\nby-the-bye, it was you who made me the offer.”\n\n“Of course I did. But to the point if you please, sir—Miss Ingram?”\n\n“Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render\nyou as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy\nwould be the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that\nend.”\n\n“Excellent! Now you are small—not one whit bigger than the end of my\nlittle finger. It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act\nin that way. Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram’s feelings, sir?”\n\n“Her feelings are concentrated in one—pride; and that needs humbling.\nWere you jealous, Jane?”\n\n“Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know\nthat. Answer me truly once more. Do you think Miss Ingram will not\nsuffer from your dishonest coquetry? Won’t she feel forsaken and\ndeserted?”\n\n“Impossible!—when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the\nidea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a\nmoment.”\n\n“You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester. I am afraid your\nprinciples on some points are eccentric.”\n\n“My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little\nawry for want of attention.”\n\n“Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been\nvouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the\nbitter pain I myself felt a while ago?”\n\n“That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the\nworld has the same pure love for me as yourself—for I lay that pleasant\nunction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection.”\n\nI turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder. I loved him very\nmuch—more than I could trust myself to say—more than words had power to\nexpress.\n\n“Ask something more,” he said presently; “it is my delight to be\nentreated, and to yield.”\n\nI was again ready with my request. “Communicate your intentions to Mrs.\nFairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was\nshocked. Give her some explanation before I see her again. It pains me\nto be misjudged by so good a woman.”\n\n“Go to your room, and put on your bonnet,” he replied. “I mean you to\naccompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the\ndrive, I will enlighten the old lady’s understanding. Did she think,\nJanet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?”\n\n“I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir.”\n\n“Station! station!—your station is in my heart, and on the necks of\nthose who would insult you, now or hereafter.—Go.”\n\nI was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax’s\nparlour, I hurried down to it. The old lady had been reading her\nmorning portion of Scripture—the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open\nbefore her, and her spectacles were upon it. Her occupation, suspended\nby Mr. Rochester’s announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed\non the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind\nstirred by unwonted tidings. Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a\nsort of effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but\nthe smile expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished. She put\nup her spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the\ntable.\n\n“I feel so astonished,” she began, “I hardly know what to say to you,\nMiss Eyre. I have surely not been dreaming, have I? Sometimes I half\nfall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never\nhappened. It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a\ndoze, that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in\nand sat down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my\nname, Alice, as he used to do. Now, can you tell me whether it is\nactually true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him? Don’t\nlaugh at me. But I really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and\nsaid that in a month you would be his wife.”\n\n“He has said the same thing to me,” I replied.\n\n“He has! Do you believe him? Have you accepted him?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nShe looked at me bewildered.\n\n“I could never have thought it. He is a proud man: all the Rochesters\nwere proud: and his father, at least, liked money. He, too, has always\nbeen called careful. He means to marry you?”\n\n“He tells me so.”\n\nShe surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there\nfound no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.\n\n“It passes me!” she continued; “but no doubt it is true since you say\nso. How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don’t know. Equality of\nposition and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are\ntwenty years of difference in your ages. He might almost be your\nfather.”\n\n“No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!” exclaimed I, nettled; “he is nothing like\nmy father! No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an\ninstant. Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at\nfive-and-twenty.”\n\n“Is it really for love he is going to marry you?” she asked.\n\nI was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my\neyes.\n\n“I am sorry to grieve you,” pursued the widow; “but you are so young,\nand so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.\nIt is an old saying that ‘all is not gold that glitters;’ and in this\ncase I do fear there will be something found to be different to what\neither you or I expect.”\n\n“Why?—am I a monster?” I said: “is it impossible that Mr. Rochester\nshould have a sincere affection for me?”\n\n“No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I\ndaresay, is fond of you. I have always noticed that you were a sort of\npet of his. There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little\nuneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your\nguard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong. I\nknew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so\ndiscreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be\ntrusted to protect yourself. Last night I cannot tell you what I\nsuffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,\nnor the master either; and then, at twelve o’clock, saw you come in\nwith him.”\n\n“Well, never mind that now,” I interrupted impatiently; “it is enough\nthat all was right.”\n\n“I hope all will be right in the end,” she said: “but believe me, you\ncannot be too careful. Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:\ndistrust yourself as well as him. Gentlemen in his station are not\naccustomed to marry their governesses.”\n\nI was growing truly irritated: happily, Adèle ran in.\n\n“Let me go,—let me go to Millcote too!” she cried. “Mr. Rochester\nwon’t: though there is so much room in the new carriage. Beg him to let\nme go, mademoiselle.”\n\n“That I will, Adèle;” and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my\ngloomy monitress. The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round\nto the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following\nhim backwards and forwards.\n\n“Adèle may accompany us, may she not, sir?”\n\n“I told her no. I’ll have no brats!—I’ll have only you.”\n\n“Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better.”\n\n“Not it: she will be a restraint.”\n\nHe was quite peremptory, both in look and voice. The chill of Mrs.\nFairfax’s warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something\nof unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes. I half lost the\nsense of power over him. I was about mechanically to obey him, without\nfurther remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked\nat my face.\n\n“What is the matter?” he asked; “all the sunshine is gone. Do you\nreally wish the bairn to go? Will it annoy you if she is left behind?”\n\n“I would far rather she went, sir.”\n\n“Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!” cried\nhe to Adèle.\n\nShe obeyed him with what speed she might.\n\n“After all, a single morning’s interruption will not matter much,” said\nhe, “when I mean shortly to claim you—your thoughts, conversation, and\ncompany—for life.”\n\nAdèle, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her\ngratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a\ncorner on the other side of him. She then peeped round to where I sat;\nso stern a neighbour was too restrictive: to him, in his present\nfractious mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any\ninformation.\n\n“Let her come to me,” I entreated: “she will, perhaps, trouble you,\nsir: there is plenty of room on this side.”\n\nHe handed her over as if she had been a lapdog. “I’ll send her to\nschool yet,” he said, but now he was smiling.\n\nAdèle heard him, and asked if she was to go to school “sans\nmademoiselle?”\n\n“Yes,” he replied, “absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take\nmademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the\nwhite valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with\nme there, and only me.”\n\n“She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her,” observed Adèle.\n\n“I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and\nhillsides in the moon are bleached with manna, Adèle.”\n\n“She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?”\n\n“Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I’ll carry\nher up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater.”\n\n“Oh, qu’elle y sera mal—peu comfortable! And her clothes, they will\nwear out: how can she get new ones?”\n\nMr. Rochester professed to be puzzled. “Hem!” said he. “What would you\ndo, Adèle? Cudgel your brains for an expedient. How would a white or a\npink cloud answer for a gown, do you think? And one could cut a pretty\nenough scarf out of a rainbow.”\n\n“She is far better as she is,” concluded Adèle, after musing some time:\n“besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon. If I\nwere mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you.”\n\n“She has consented: she has pledged her word.”\n\n“But you can’t get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all\nair; and neither you nor she can fly.”\n\n“Adèle, look at that field.” We were now outside Thornfield gates, and\nbowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was\nwell laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty\ntimber trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.\n\n“In that field, Adèle, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight\nsince—the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard\nmeadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me\non a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began\nto write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had\nfor happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight\nwas fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped\ntwo yards off me. I looked at it. It was a little thing with a veil of\ngossamer on its head. I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at\nmy knee. I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I\nread its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to\nthis effect—\n\n“It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to\nmake me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely\nplace—such as the moon, for instance—and it nodded its head towards her\nhorn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver\nvale where we might live. I said I should like to go; but reminded it,\nas you did me, that I had no wings to fly.\n\n“‘Oh,’ returned the fairy, ‘that does not signify! Here is a talisman\nwill remove all difficulties;’ and she held out a pretty gold ring.\n‘Put it,’ she said, ‘on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am\nyours, and you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own\nheaven yonder.’ She nodded again at the moon. The ring, Adèle, is in my\nbreeches-pocket, under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to\nchange it to a ring again.”\n\n“But what has mademoiselle to do with it? I don’t care for the fairy:\nyou said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?”\n\n“Mademoiselle is a fairy,” he said, whispering mysteriously. Whereupon\nI told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a\nfund of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester “un vrai\nmenteur,” and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his\n“contes de fée,” and that “du reste, il n’y avait pas de fées, et quand\nmême il y en avait:” she was sure they would never appear to him, nor\never give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.\n\nThe hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me. Mr.\nRochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was\nordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses. I hated the business, I begged\nleave to defer it: no—it should be gone through with now. By dint of\nentreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to\ntwo: these however, he vowed he would select himself. With anxiety I\nwatched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of\nthe most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin. I told him in\na new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and\na silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his\nchoice. With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I\npersuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and\npearl-grey silk. “It might pass for the present,” he said; “but he\nwould yet see me glittering like a parterre.”\n\nGlad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a\njeweller’s shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a\nsense of annoyance and degradation. As we re-entered the carriage, and\nI sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of\nevents, dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten—the letter of my uncle,\nJohn Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his\nlegatee. “It would, indeed, be a relief,” I thought, “if I had ever so\nsmall an independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by\nMr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower\nfalling daily round me. I will write to Madeira the moment I get home,\nand tell my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had\nbut a prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of\nfortune, I could better endure to be kept by him now.” And somewhat\nrelieved by this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I\nventured once more to meet my master’s and lover’s eye, which most\npertinaciously sought mine, though I averted both face and gaze. He\nsmiled; and I thought his smile was such as a sultan might, in a\nblissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave his gold and gems had\nenriched: I crushed his hand, which was ever hunting mine, vigorously,\nand thrust it back to him red with the passionate pressure.\n\n“You need not look in that way,” I said; “if you do, I’ll wear nothing\nbut my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter. I’ll be married in\nthis lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of\nthe pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the\nblack satin.”\n\nHe chuckled; he rubbed his hands. “Oh, it is rich to see and hear her!”\nhe exclaimed. “Is she original? Is she piquant? I would not exchange\nthis one little English girl for the Grand Turk’s whole seraglio,\ngazelle-eyes, houri forms, and all!”\n\nThe Eastern allusion bit me again. “I’ll not stand you an inch in the\nstead of a seraglio,” I said; “so don’t consider me an equivalent for\none. If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,\nto the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive\nslave-purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend\nsatisfactorily here.”\n\n“And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of\nflesh and such an assortment of black eyes?”\n\n“I’ll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty\nto them that are enslaved—your harem inmates amongst the rest. I’ll get\nadmitted there, and I’ll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw\nas you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our\nhands: nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have\nsigned a charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred.”\n\n“I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane.”\n\n“I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with\nan eye like that. While you looked so, I should be certain that\nwhatever charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when\nreleased, would be to violate its conditions.”\n\n“Why, Jane, what would you have? I fear you will compel me to go\nthrough a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the\naltar. You will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms—what will they\nbe?”\n\n“I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations. Do\nyou remember what you said of Céline Varens?—of the diamonds, the\ncashmeres you gave her? I will not be your English Céline Varens. I\nshall continue to act as Adèle’s governess; by that I shall earn my\nboard and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides. I’ll furnish my\nown wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but—”\n\n“Well, but what?”\n\n“Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be\nquit.”\n\n“Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven’t\nyour equal,” said he. We were now approaching Thornfield. “Will it\nplease you to dine with me to-day?” he asked, as we re-entered the\ngates.\n\n“No, thank you, sir.”\n\n“And what for, ‘no, thank you?’ if one may inquire.”\n\n“I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should\nnow: till—”\n\n“Till what? You delight in half-phrases.”\n\n“Till I can’t help it.”\n\n“Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the\ncompanion of my repast?”\n\n“I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on\nas usual for another month.”\n\n“You will give up your governessing slavery at once.”\n\n“Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not. I shall just go on with\nit as usual. I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been\naccustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel\ndisposed to see me, and I’ll come then; but at no other time.”\n\n“I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all\nthis, ‘pour me donner une contenance,’ as Adèle would say; and\nunfortunately I have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box. But\nlisten—whisper. It is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine\npresently; and when once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold,\nI’ll just—figuratively speaking—attach you to a chain like this”\n(touching his watch-guard). “Yes, bonny wee thing, I’ll wear you in my\nbosom, lest my jewel I should tyne.”\n\nHe said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he\nafterwards lifted out Adèle, I entered the house, and made good my\nretreat upstairs.\n\nHe duly summoned me to his presence in the evening. I had prepared an\noccupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in\na _tête-à-tête_ conversation. I remembered his fine voice; I knew he\nliked to sing—good singers generally do. I was no vocalist myself, and,\nin his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in\nlistening when the performance was good. No sooner had twilight, that\nhour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the\nlattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love\nof heaven, to give me a song. He said I was a capricious witch, and\nthat he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was\nlike the present.\n\n“Did I like his voice?” he asked.\n\n“Very much.” I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of\nhis; but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e’en soothe\nand stimulate it.\n\n“Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment.”\n\n“Very well, sir, I will try.”\n\nI did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated “a\nlittle bungler.” Being pushed unceremoniously to one side—which was\nprecisely what I wished—he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany\nhimself: for he could play as well as sing. I hied me to the\nwindow-recess. And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees\nand dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following\nstrain:—\n\n“The truest love that ever heart\nFelt at its kindled core,\nDid through each vein, in quickened start,\nThe tide of being pour.\n\nHer coming was my hope each day,\nHer parting was my pain;\nThe chance that did her steps delay\nWas ice in every vein.\n\nI dreamed it would be nameless bliss,\nAs I loved, loved to be;\nAnd to this object did I press\nAs blind as eagerly.\n\nBut wide as pathless was the space\nThat lay our lives between,\nAnd dangerous as the foamy race\nOf ocean-surges green.\n\nAnd haunted as a robber-path\nThrough wilderness or wood;\nFor Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,\nBetween our spirits stood.\n\nI dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;\nI omens did defy:\nWhatever menaced, harassed, warned,\nI passed impetuous by.\n\nOn sped my rainbow, fast as light;\nI flew as in a dream;\nFor glorious rose upon my sight\nThat child of Shower and Gleam.\n\nStill bright on clouds of suffering dim\nShines that soft, solemn joy;\nNor care I now, how dense and grim\nDisasters gather nigh.\n\nI care not in this moment sweet,\nThough all I have rushed o’er\nShould come on pinion, strong and fleet,\nProclaiming vengeance sore:\n\nThough haughty Hate should strike me down,\nRight, bar approach to me,\nAnd grinding Might, with furious frown,\nSwear endless enmity.\n\nMy love has placed her little hand\nWith noble faith in mine,\nAnd vowed that wedlock’s sacred band\nOur nature shall entwine.\n\nMy love has sworn, with sealing kiss,\nWith me to live—to die;\nI have at last my nameless bliss.\nAs I love—loved am I!”\n\n\nHe rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his\nfull falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every\nlineament. I quailed momentarily—then I rallied. Soft scene, daring\ndemonstration, I would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon\nof defence must be prepared—I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I\nasked with asperity, “whom he was going to marry now?”\n\n“That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane.”\n\n“Indeed! I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had\ntalked of his future wife dying with him. What did he mean by such a\npagan idea? _I_ had no intention of dying with him—he might depend on\nthat.”\n\n“Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!\nDeath was not for such as I.”\n\n“Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he\nhad: but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee.”\n\n“Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a\nreconciling kiss?”\n\n“No: I would rather be excused.”\n\nHere I heard myself apostrophised as a “hard little thing;” and it was\nadded, “any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing\nsuch stanzas crooned in her praise.”\n\nI assured him I was naturally hard—very flinty, and that he would often\nfind me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers\nrugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he\nshould know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was\nyet time to rescind it.\n\n“Would I be quiet and talk rationally?”\n\n“I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I\nflattered myself I was doing that now.”\n\nHe fretted, pished, and pshawed. “Very good,” I thought; “you may fume\nand fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you,\nI am certain. I like you more than I can say; but I’ll not sink into a\nbathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I’ll keep you\nfrom the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent\naid that distance between you and myself most conducive to our real\nmutual advantage.”\n\nFrom less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,\nafter he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I\ngot up, and saying, “I wish you good-night, sir,” in my natural and\nwonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.\n\nThe system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of\nprobation; and with the best success. He was kept, to be sure, rather\ncross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently\nentertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove\nsensibility, while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his\njudgment, satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.\n\nIn other people’s presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet;\nany other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the\nevening conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him. He continued to\nsend for me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I\nappeared before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as “love” and\n“darling” on his lips: the best words at my service were “provoking\npuppet,” “malicious elf,” “sprite,” “changeling,” &c. For caresses,\ntoo, I now got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the\narm; for a kiss on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear. It was all\nright: at present I decidedly preferred these fierce favours to\nanything more tender. Mrs. Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on\nmy account vanished; therefore I was certain I did well. Meantime, Mr.\nRochester affirmed I was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened\nawful vengeance for my present conduct at some period fast coming. I\nlaughed in my sleeve at his menaces. “I can keep you in reasonable\ncheck now,” I reflected; “and I don’t doubt to be able to do it\nhereafter: if one expedient loses its virtue, another must be devised.”\n\nYet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have\npleased than teased him. My future husband was becoming to me my whole\nworld; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven. He stood\nbetween me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes\nbetween man and the broad sun. I could not, in those days, see God for\nHis creature: of whom I had made an idol.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nThe month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being\nnumbered. There was no putting off the day that advanced—the bridal\nday; and all preparations for its arrival were complete. _I_, at least,\nhad nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,\nranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this\ntime, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I\n(D.V.),—or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet\nI knew not. The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay,\nfour little squares, in the drawer. Mr. Rochester had himself written\nthe direction, “Mrs. Rochester, —— Hotel, London,” on each: I could not\npersuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed. Mrs. Rochester!\nShe did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time\nafter eight o’clock A.M.; and I would wait to be assured she had come\ninto the world alive before I assigned to her all that property. It was\nenough that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said\nto be hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw\nbonnet: for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the\npearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped\nportmanteau. I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like\napparel it contained; which, at this evening hour—nine o’clock—gave out\ncertainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment. “I\nwill leave you by yourself, white dream,” I said. “I am feverish: I\nhear the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it.”\n\nIt was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not\nonly the anticipation of the great change—the new life which was to\ncommence to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share,\ndoubtless, in producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me\nforth at this late hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause\ninfluenced my mind more than they.\n\nI had at heart a strange and anxious thought. Something had happened\nwhich I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but\nmyself: it had taken place the preceding night. Mr. Rochester that\nnight was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had\ncalled him to a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty\nmiles off—business it was requisite he should settle in person,\nprevious to his meditated departure from England. I waited now his\nreturn; eager to disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of\nthe enigma that perplexed me. Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I\ndisclose my secret to him, you shall share the confidence.\n\nI sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day\nhad blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a\nspeck of rain. Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to\naugment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one\nway, never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once\nin an hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads\nnorthward—the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on\nmass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.\n\nIt was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,\ndelivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering\nthrough space. Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the\nchestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the\ncentre, gasped ghastly. The cloven halves were not broken from each\nother, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;\nthough community of vitality was destroyed—the sap could flow no more:\ntheir great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter’s tempests\nwould be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might\nbe said to form one tree—a ruin, but an entire ruin.\n\n“You did right to hold fast to each other,” I said: as if the\nmonster-splinters were living things, and could hear me. “I think,\nscathed as you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little\nsense of life in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful,\nhonest roots: you will never have green leaves more—never more see\nbirds making nests and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of\npleasure and love is over with you: but you are not desolate: each of\nyou has a comrade to sympathise with him in his decay.” As I looked up\nat them, the moon appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which\nfilled their fissure; her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she\nseemed to throw on me one bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself\nagain instantly in the deep drift of cloud. The wind fell, for a\nsecond, round Thornfield; but far away over wood and water, poured a\nwild, melancholy wail: it was sad to listen to, and I ran off again.\n\nHere and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples\nwith which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I\nemployed myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them\ninto the house and put them away in the store-room. Then I repaired to\nthe library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer,\nI knew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a\ncheerful hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some\ntime, and burnt well. I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I\nwheeled the table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles\nbrought in ready for lighting. More restless than ever, when I had\ncompleted these arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in\nthe house: a little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the\nhall simultaneously struck ten.\n\n“How late it grows!” I said. “I will run down to the gates: it is\nmoonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road. He may be\ncoming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense.”\n\nThe wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but\nthe road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all\nstill and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at\nintervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried\nby one moving speck.\n\nA puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked—a tear of disappointment\nand impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away. I lingered; the moon\nshut herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of\ndense cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.\n\n“I wish he would come! I wish he would come!” I exclaimed, seized with\nhypochondriac foreboding. I had expected his arrival before tea; now it\nwas dark: what could keep him? Had an accident happened? The event of\nlast night again recurred to me. I interpreted it as a warning of\ndisaster. I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had\nenjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its\nmeridian, and must now decline.\n\n“Well, I cannot return to the house,” I thought; “I cannot sit by the\nfireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs\nthan strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him.”\n\nI set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of\na mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a\ndog ran by his side. Away with evil presentiment! It was he: here he\nwas, mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot. He saw me; for the moon had\nopened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took\nhis hat off, and waved it round his head. I now ran to meet him.\n\n“There!” he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the\nsaddle: “You can’t do without me, that is evident. Step on my boot-toe;\ngive me both hands: mount!”\n\nI obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him. A hearty kissing I\ngot for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well\nas I could. He checked himself in his exultation to demand, “But is\nthere anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an\nhour? Is there anything wrong?”\n\n“No, but I thought you would never come. I could not bear to wait in\nthe house for you, especially with this rain and wind.”\n\n“Rain and wind, indeed! Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my\ncloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek\nand hand are burning hot. I ask again, is there anything the matter?”\n\n“Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy.”\n\n“Then you have been both?”\n\n“Rather: but I’ll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay\nyou will only laugh at me for my pains.”\n\n“I’ll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare\nnot: my prize is not certain. This is you, who have been as slippery as\nan eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose? I could not lay\na finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up\na stray lamb in my arms. You wandered out of the fold to seek your\nshepherd, did you, Jane?”\n\n“I wanted you: but don’t boast. Here we are at Thornfield: now let me\nget down.”\n\nHe landed me on the pavement. As John took his horse, and he followed\nme into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on,\nand then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for\nthe staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I\nlong; in five minutes I rejoined him. I found him at supper.\n\n“Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal\nbut one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time.”\n\nI sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.\n\n“Is it because you have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane? Is\nit the thoughts of going to London that takes away your appetite?”\n\n“I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know\nwhat thoughts I have in my head. Everything in life seems unreal.”\n\n“Except me: I am substantial enough—touch me.”\n\n“You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream.”\n\nHe held out his hand, laughing. “Is that a dream?” said he, placing it\nclose to my eyes. He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as\nwell as a long, strong arm.\n\n“Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream,” said I, as I put it down from\nbefore my face. “Sir, have you finished supper?”\n\n“Yes, Jane.”\n\nI rang the bell and ordered away the tray. When we were again alone, I\nstirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master’s knee.\n\n“It is near midnight,” I said.\n\n“Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before\nmy wedding.”\n\n“I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have\nno wish to go to bed.”\n\n“Are all your arrangements complete?”\n\n“All, sir.”\n\n“And on my part likewise,” he returned, “I have settled everything; and\nwe shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our\nreturn from church.”\n\n“Very well, sir.”\n\n“With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word—‘very well,’\nJane! What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how\nstrangely your eyes glitter! Are you well?”\n\n“I believe I am.”\n\n“Believe! What is the matter? Tell me what you feel.”\n\n“I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel. I wish this\npresent hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may\ncome charged?”\n\n“This is hypochondria, Jane. You have been over-excited, or\nover-fatigued.”\n\n“Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?”\n\n“Calm?—no: but happy—to the heart’s core.”\n\nI looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was\nardent and flushed.\n\n“Give me your confidence, Jane,” he said: “relieve your mind of any\nweight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me. What do you fear?—that\nI shall not prove a good husband?”\n\n“It is the idea farthest from my thoughts.”\n\n“Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?—of the\nnew life into which you are passing?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex\nand pain me. I want an explanation.”\n\n“Then, sir, listen. You were from home last night?”\n\n“I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had\nhappened in my absence:—nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in\nshort, it has disturbed you. Let me hear it. Mrs. Fairfax has said\nsomething, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?—your\nsensitive self-respect has been wounded?”\n\n“No, sir.” It struck twelve—I waited till the time-piece had concluded\nits silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then\nI proceeded.\n\n“All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless\nbustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting\nfears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to\nhave the hope of living with you, because I love you. No, sir, don’t\ncaress me now—let me talk undisturbed. Yesterday I trusted well in\nProvidence, and believed that events were working together for your\ngood and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect—the calmness of the\nair and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on\nyour journey. I walked a little while on the pavement after tea,\nthinking of you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely\nmissed your actual presence. I thought of the life that lay before\nme—_your_ life, sir—an existence more expansive and stirring than my\nown: as much more so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs\nare than the shallows of its own strait channel. I wondered why\nmoralists call this world a dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like\na rose. Just at sunset, the air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went\nin, Sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding-dress, which they\nhad just brought; and under it in the box I found your present—the veil\nwhich, in your princely extravagance, you sent for from London:\nresolved, I suppose, since I would not have jewels, to cheat me into\naccepting something as costly. I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised\nhow I would tease you about your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts\nto masque your plebeian bride in the attributes of a peeress. I thought\nhow I would carry down to you the square of unembroidered blond I had\nmyself prepared as a covering for my low-born head, and ask if that was\nnot good enough for a woman who could bring her husband neither\nfortune, beauty, nor connections. I saw plainly how you would look; and\nheard your impetuous republican answers, and your haughty disavowal of\nany necessity on your part to augment your wealth, or elevate your\nstanding, by marrying either a purse or a coronet.”\n\n“How well you read me, you witch!” interposed Mr. Rochester: “but what\ndid you find in the veil besides its embroidery? Did you find poison,\nor a dagger, that you look so mournful now?”\n\n“No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found\nnothing save Fairfax Rochester’s pride; and that did not scare me,\nbecause I am used to the sight of the demon. But, sir, as it grew dark,\nthe wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now—wild and\nhigh—but ‘with a sullen, moaning sound’ far more eerie. I wished you\nwere at home. I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair\nand fireless hearth chilled me. For some time after I went to bed, I\ncould not sleep—a sense of anxious excitement distressed me. The gale\nstill rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound;\nwhether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it\nrecurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it\nmust be some dog howling at a distance. I was glad when it ceased. On\nsleeping, I continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night. I\ncontinued also the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange,\nregretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us. During all my\nfirst sleep, I was following the windings of an unknown road; total\nobscurity environed me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge\nof a little child: a very small creature, too young and feeble to walk,\nand which shivered in my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear. I\nthought, sir, that you were on the road a long way before me; and I\nstrained every nerve to overtake you, and made effort on effort to\nutter your name and entreat you to stop—but my movements were fettered,\nand my voice still died away inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew\nfarther and farther every moment.”\n\n“And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to\nyou? Little nervous subject! Forget visionary woe, and think only of\nreal happiness! You say you love me, Janet: yes—I will not forget that;\nand you cannot deny it. _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your\nlips. I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but\nsweet as music—‘I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of\nliving with you, Edward, because I love you.’ Do you love me,\nJane?—repeat it.”\n\n“I do, sir—I do, with my whole heart.”\n\n“Well,” he said, after some minutes’ silence, “it is strange; but that\nsentence has penetrated my breast painfully. Why? I think because you\nsaid it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward\ngaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is\ntoo much as if some spirit were near me. Look wicked, Jane: as you know\nwell how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me\nyou hate me—tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather\nbe incensed than saddened.”\n\n“I will tease you and vex you to your heart’s content, when I have\nfinished my tale: but hear me to the end.”\n\n“I thought, Jane, you had told me all. I thought I had found the source\nof your melancholy in a dream.”\n\nI shook my head. “What! is there more? But I will not believe it to be\nanything important. I warn you of incredulity beforehand. Go on.”\n\nThe disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his\nmanner, surprised me: but I proceeded.\n\n“I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin,\nthe retreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the stately front\nnothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very\nfragile-looking. I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the\ngrass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and\nthere over a fallen fragment of cornice. Wrapped up in a shawl, I still\ncarried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,\nhowever tired were my arms—however much its weight impeded my progress,\nI must retain it. I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the\nroad; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and\nfor a distant country. I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous\nhaste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones\nrolled from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the\nchild clung round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I\ngained the summit. I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening\nevery moment. The blast blew so strong I could not stand. I sat down on\nthe narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an\nangle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall\ncrumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my\nbalance, fell, and woke.”\n\n“Now, Jane, that is all.”\n\n“All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come. On waking, a gleam\ndazzled my eyes; I thought—Oh, it is daylight! But I was mistaken; it\nwas only candlelight. Sophie, I supposed, had come in. There was a\nlight in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before\ngoing to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard\na rustling there. I asked, ‘Sophie, what are you doing?’ No one\nanswered; but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held\nit aloft, and surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.\n‘Sophie! Sophie!’ I again cried: and still it was silent. I had risen\nup in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over\nme; and then my blood crept cold through my veins. Mr. Rochester, this\nwas not Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was\nnot—no, I was sure of it, and am still—it was not even that strange\nwoman, Grace Poole.”\n\n“It must have been one of them,” interrupted my master.\n\n“No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary. The shape standing\nbefore me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield\nHall before; the height, the contour were new to me.”\n\n“Describe it, Jane.”\n\n“It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair\nhanging long down her back. I know not what dress she had on: it was\nwhite and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell.”\n\n“Did you see her face?”\n\n“Not at first. But presently she took my veil from its place; she held\nit up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and\nturned to the mirror. At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage\nand features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass.”\n\n“And how were they?”\n\n“Fearful and ghastly to me—oh, sir, I never saw a face like it! It was\na discoloured face—it was a savage face. I wish I could forget the roll\nof the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!”\n\n“Ghosts are usually pale, Jane.”\n\n“This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow\nfurrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.\nShall I tell you of what it reminded me?”\n\n“You may.”\n\n“Of the foul German spectre—the Vampyre.”\n\n“Ah!—what did it do?”\n\n“Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and\nflinging both on the floor, trampled on them.”\n\n\nIt removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and\nflinging both on the floor, trampled on them\n\n“Afterwards?”\n\n“It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn\napproaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door. Just at\nmy bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me—she\nthrust up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my\neyes. I was aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost\nconsciousness: for the second time in my life—only the second time—I\nbecame insensible from terror.”\n\n“Who was with you when you revived?”\n\n“No one, sir, but the broad day. I rose, bathed my head and face in\nwater, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,\nand determined that to none but you would I impart this vision. Now,\nsir, tell me who and what that woman was?”\n\n“The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain. I must be\ncareful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough\nhandling.”\n\n“Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real:\nthe transaction actually took place.”\n\n“And your previous dreams, were they real too? Is Thornfield Hall a\nruin? Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles? Am I leaving you\nwithout a tear—without a kiss—without a word?”\n\n“Not yet.”\n\n“Am I about to do it? Why, the day is already commenced which is to\nbind us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no\nrecurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that.”\n\n“Mental terrors, sir! I wish I could believe them to be only such: I\nwish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the\nmystery of that awful visitant.”\n\n“And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal.”\n\n“But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I\nlooked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful\naspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there—on the carpet—I\nsaw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,—the veil, torn from\ntop to bottom in two halves!”\n\nI felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round\nme. “Thank God!” he exclaimed, “that if anything malignant did come\nnear you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed. Oh, to think\nwhat might have happened!”\n\nHe drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could\nscarcely pant. After some minutes’ silence, he continued, cheerily—\n\n“Now, Janet, I’ll explain to you all about it. It was half dream, half\nreality. A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman\nwas—must have been—Grace Poole. You call her a strange being yourself:\nfrom all you know, you have reason so to call her—what did she do to\nme? what to Mason? In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed\nher entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you\nwere, you ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own:\nthe long dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated\nstature, were figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the\nspiteful tearing of the veil was real: and it is like her. I see you\nwould ask why I keep such a woman in my house: when we have been\nmarried a year and a day, I will tell you; but not now. Are you\nsatisfied, Jane? Do you accept my solution of the mystery?”\n\nI reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:\nsatisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear\nso—relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented\nsmile. And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.\n\n“Does not Sophie sleep with Adèle in the nursery?” he asked, as I lit\nmy candle.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“And there is room enough in Adèle’s little bed for you. You must share\nit with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have\nrelated should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep\nalone: promise me to go to the nursery.”\n\n“I shall be very glad to do so, sir.”\n\n“And fasten the door securely on the inside. Wake Sophie when you go\nupstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time\nto-morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before\neight. And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.\nDon’t you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is\nno more beating of rain against the window-panes: look here” (he lifted\nup the curtain)—“it is a lovely night!”\n\nIt was. Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping\nbefore the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off\neastward in long, silvered columns. The moon shone peacefully.\n\n“Well,” said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, “how is my\nJanet now?”\n\n“The night is serene, sir; and so am I.”\n\n“And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy\nlove and blissful union.”\n\nThis prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of\nsorrow, but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.\nWith little Adèle in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood—so\ntranquil, so passionless, so innocent—and waited for the coming day:\nall my life was awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun\nrose I rose too. I remember Adèle clung to me as I left her: I remember\nI kissed her as I loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried\nover her with strange emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs\nwould break her still sound repose. She seemed the emblem of my past\nlife; and he, I was now to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored,\ntype of my unknown future day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nSophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in\naccomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,\nimpatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come. She was just\nfastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with\na brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.\n\n“Stop!” she cried in French. “Look at yourself in the mirror: you have\nnot taken one peep.”\n\nSo I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my\nusual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger. “Jane!”\ncalled a voice, and I hastened down. I was received at the foot of the\nstairs by Mr. Rochester.\n\n“Lingerer!” he said, “my brain is on fire with impatience, and you\ntarry so long!”\n\nHe took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over,\npronounced me “fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but\nthe desire of his eyes,” and then telling me he would give me but ten\nminutes to eat some breakfast, he rang the bell. One of his lately\nhired servants, a footman, answered it.\n\n“Is John getting the carriage ready?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Is the luggage brought down?”\n\n“They are bringing it down, sir.”\n\n“Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk\nare there: return and tell me.”\n\nThe church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the\nfootman soon returned.\n\n“Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice.”\n\n“And the carriage?”\n\n“The horses are harnessing.”\n\n“We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment\nwe return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the\ncoachman in his seat.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Jane, are you ready?”\n\nI rose. There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait\nfor or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I. Mrs. Fairfax stood in the\nhall as we passed. I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was\nheld by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly\nfollow; and to look at Mr. Rochester’s face was to feel that not a\nsecond of delay would be tolerated for any purpose. I wonder what other\nbridegroom ever looked as he did—so bent up to a purpose, so grimly\nresolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such\nflaming and flashing eyes.\n\nI know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I\ngazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both\nseemed migrated into Mr. Rochester’s frame. I wanted to see the\ninvisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a\nglance fierce and fell. I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he\nseemed breasting and resisting.\n\nAt the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of\nbreath. “Am I cruel in my love?” he said. “Delay an instant: lean on\nme, Jane.”\n\nAnd now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising\ncalm before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy\nmorning sky beyond. I remember something, too, of the green\ngrave-mounds; and I have not forgotten, either, two figures of\nstrangers straying amongst the low hillocks and reading the mementoes\ngraven on the few mossy head-stones. I noticed them, because, as they\nsaw us, they passed round to the back of the church; and I doubted not\nthey were going to enter by the side-aisle door and witness the\nceremony. By Mr. Rochester they were not observed; he was earnestly\nlooking at my face, from which the blood had, I daresay, momentarily\nfled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips cold. When I\nrallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the path to the\nporch.\n\nWe entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white\nsurplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him. All was still: two\nshadows only moved in a remote corner. My conjecture had been correct:\nthe strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault\nof the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails\nthe old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the\nremains of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the\ncivil wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.\n\nOur place was taken at the communion rails. Hearing a cautious step\nbehind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers—a\ngentleman, evidently—was advancing up the chancel. The service began.\nThe explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then\nthe clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly\ntowards Mr. Rochester, went on.\n\n“I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day\nof judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that\nif either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined\ntogether in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured\nthat so many as are coupled together otherwise than God’s Word doth\nallow, are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony\nlawful.”\n\nHe paused, as the custom is. When is the pause after that sentence ever\nbroken by reply? Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years. And the\nclergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his\nbreath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched\ntowards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, “Wilt thou have\nthis woman for thy wedded wife?”—when a distinct and near voice said—\n\n“The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment.”\n\nThe clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did\nthe same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled\nunder his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or\neyes, he said, “Proceed.”\n\nProfound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low\nintonation. Presently Mr. Wood said—\n\n“I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been\nasserted, and evidence of its truth or falsehood.”\n\n“The ceremony is quite broken off,” subjoined the voice behind us. “I\nam in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to\nthis marriage exists.”\n\nMr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid,\nmaking no movement but to possess himself of my hand. What a hot and\nstrong grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm,\nmassive front at this moment! How his eye shone, still watchful, and\nyet wild beneath!\n\nMr. Wood seemed at a loss. “What is the nature of the impediment?” he\nasked. “Perhaps it may be got over—explained away?”\n\n“Hardly,” was the answer. “I have called it insuperable, and I speak\nadvisedly.”\n\nThe speaker came forward and leaned on the rails. He continued,\nuttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly—\n\n“It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage. Mr.\nRochester has a wife now living.”\n\nMy nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated\nto thunder—my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt\nfrost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning. I\nlooked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me. His whole face was\ncolourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint. He disavowed\nnothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things. Without speaking,\nwithout smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he\nonly twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.\n\n“Who are you?” he asked of the intruder.\n\n“My name is Briggs, a solicitor of —— Street, London.”\n\n“And you would thrust on me a wife?”\n\n“I would remind you of your lady’s existence, sir, which the law\nrecognises, if you do not.”\n\n“Favour me with an account of her—with her name, her parentage, her\nplace of abode.”\n\n“Certainly.” Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read\nout in a sort of official, nasal voice:—\n\n“‘I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. —— (a date of\nfifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in\nthe county of ——, and of Ferndean Manor, in ——shire, England, was\nmarried to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason,\nmerchant, and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at —— church, Spanish\nTown, Jamaica. The record of the marriage will be found in the register\nof that church—a copy of it is now in my possession. Signed, Richard\nMason.’”\n\n“That—if a genuine document—may prove I have been married, but it does\nnot prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living.”\n\n“She was living three months ago,” returned the lawyer.\n\n“How do you know?”\n\n“I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will\nscarcely controvert.”\n\n“Produce him—or go to hell.”\n\n“I will produce him first—he is on the spot. Mr. Mason, have the\ngoodness to step forward.”\n\nMr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too,\na sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the\nspasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame. The second\nstranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a\npale face looked over the solicitor’s shoulder—yes, it was Mason\nhimself. Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him. His eye, as I have\noften said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in\nits gloom; and his face flushed—olive cheek and hueless forehead\nreceived a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he\nstirred, lifted his strong arm—he could have struck Mason, dashed him\non the church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his\nbody—but Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, “Good God!” Contempt\nfell cool on Mr. Rochester—his passion died as if a blight had\nshrivelled it up: he only asked—“What have _you_ to say?”\n\nAn inaudible reply escaped Mason’s white lips.\n\n“The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly. I again demand,\nwhat have _you_ to say?”\n\n“Sir—sir,” interrupted the clergyman, “do not forget you are in a\nsacred place.” Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, “Are you\naware, sir, whether or not this gentleman’s wife is still living?”\n\n“Courage,” urged the lawyer,—“speak out.”\n\n“She is now living at Thornfield Hall,” said Mason, in more articulate\ntones: “I saw her there last April. I am her brother.”\n\n“At Thornfield Hall!” ejaculated the clergyman. “Impossible! I am an\nold resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.\nRochester at Thornfield Hall.”\n\nI saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester’s lips, and he muttered—\n\n“No, by God! I took care that none should hear of it—or of her under\nthat name.” He mused—for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he\nformed his resolve, and announced it—\n\n“Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.\nWood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the\nclerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day.” The man\nobeyed.\n\nMr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: “Bigamy is an ugly\nword!—I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred\nme, or Providence has checked me,—perhaps the last. I am little better\nthan a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,\ndeserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless\nfire and deathless worm. Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:—what this\nlawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman\nto whom I was married lives! You say you never heard of a Mrs.\nRochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a\ntime inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept\nthere under watch and ward. Some have whispered to you that she is my\nbastard half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress. I now inform you that\nshe is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,—Bertha Mason by name;\nsister of this resolute personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs\nand white cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may bear. Cheer\nup, Dick!—never fear me!—I’d almost as soon strike a woman as you.\nBertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family; idiots and maniacs\nthrough three generations! Her mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman\nand a drunkard!—as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for they\nwere silent on family secrets before. Bertha, like a dutiful child,\ncopied her parent in both points. I had a charming partner—pure, wise,\nmodest: you can fancy I was a happy man. I went through rich scenes!\nOh! my experience has been heavenly, if you only knew it! But I owe you\nno further explanation. Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come\nup to the house and visit Mrs. Poole’s patient, and _my wife_! You\nshall see what sort of a being I was cheated into espousing, and judge\nwhether or not I had a right to break the compact, and seek sympathy\nwith something at least human. This girl,” he continued, looking at me,\n“knew no more than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she thought all\nwas fair and legal; and never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into\na feigned union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad,\nand embruted partner! Come all of you—follow!”\n\nStill holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came\nafter. At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.\n\n“Take it back to the coach-house, John,” said Mr. Rochester coolly; “it\nwill not be wanted to-day.”\n\nAt our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adèle, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet\nand greet us.\n\n“To the right-about—every soul!” cried the master; “away with your\ncongratulations! Who wants them? Not I!—they are fifteen years too\nlate!”\n\nHe passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still\nbeckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did. We mounted the\nfirst staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:\nthe low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester’s master-key, admitted us\nto the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.\n\n“You know this place, Mason,” said our guide; “she bit and stabbed you\nhere.”\n\nHe lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,\ntoo, he opened. In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded\nby a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a\nchain. Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in\na saucepan. In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure\nran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast or human being,\none could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all\nfours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it\nwas covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild\nas a mane, hid its head and face.\n\n“Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!” said Mr. Rochester. “How are you? and how is\nyour charge to-day?”\n\n“We’re tolerable, sir, I thank you,” replied Grace, lifting the boiling\nmess carefully on to the hob: “rather snappish, but not ’rageous.”\n\nA fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the\nclothed hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.\n\n“Ah! sir, she sees you!” exclaimed Grace: “you’d better not stay.”\n\n“Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments.”\n\n“Take care then, sir!—for God’s sake, take care!”\n\nThe maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and\ngazed wildly at her visitors. I recognised well that purple face,—those\nbloated features. Mrs. Poole advanced.\n\n“Keep out of the way,” said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: “she\nhas no knife now, I suppose, and I’m on my guard.”\n\n“One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in\nmortal discretion to fathom her craft.”\n\n“We had better leave her,” whispered Mason.\n\n“Go to the devil!” was his brother-in-law’s recommendation.\n\n“’Ware!” cried Grace. The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously. Mr.\nRochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his\nthroat viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled. She\nwas a big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent\nbesides: she showed virile force in the contest—more than once she\nalmost throttled him, athletic as he was. He could have settled her\nwith a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only\nwrestle. At last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and\nhe pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he\nbound her to a chair. The operation was performed amidst the fiercest\nyells and the most convulsive plunges. Mr. Rochester then turned to the\nspectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.\n\n“That is _my wife_,” said he. “Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am\never to know—such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure\nhours! And _this_ is what I wished to have” (laying his hand on my\nshoulder): “this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth\nof hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her\njust as a change after that fierce ragout. Wood and Briggs, look at the\ndifference! Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder—this\nface with that mask—this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of\nthe gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge\nye shall be judged! Off with you now. I must shut up my prize.”\n\nWe all withdrew. Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some\nfurther order to Grace Poole. The solicitor addressed me as he\ndescended the stair.\n\n“You, madam,” said he, “are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be\nglad to hear it—if, indeed, he should be still living—when Mr. Mason\nreturns to Madeira.”\n\n“My uncle! What of him? Do you know him?”\n\n“Mr. Mason does. Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his\nhouse for some years. When your uncle received your letter intimating\nthe contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason,\nwho was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to\nJamaica, happened to be with him. Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence;\nfor he knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the\nname of Rochester. Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may\nsuppose, revealed the real state of matters. Your uncle, I am sorry to\nsay, is now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his\ndisease—decline—and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will\never rise. He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate\nyou from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason\nto lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage. He\nreferred him to me for assistance. I used all despatch, and am thankful\nI was not too late: as you, doubtless, must be also. Were I not morally\ncertain that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would\nadvise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had\nbetter remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of\nMr. Eyre. Have we anything else to stay for?” he inquired of Mr. Mason.\n\n“No, no—let us be gone,” was the anxious reply; and without waiting to\ntake leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door. The\nclergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or\nreproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.\n\nI heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to\nwhich I had now withdrawn. The house cleared, I shut myself in,\nfastened the bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded—not to weep,\nnot to mourn, I was yet too calm for that, but—mechanically to take off\nthe wedding dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn\nyesterday, as I thought, for the last time. I then sat down: I felt\nweak and tired. I leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on\nthem. And now I thought: till now I had only heard, seen,\nmoved—followed up and down where I was led or dragged—watched event\nrush on event, disclosure open beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I\nthought_.\n\nThe morning had been a quiet morning enough—all except the brief scene\nwith the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy;\nthere was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no\ndefiance or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken,\na calmly pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short\nquestions put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence\nadduced; an open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master;\nthen the living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all\nwas over.\n\nI was in my own room as usual—just myself, without obvious change:\nnothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me. And yet where was\nthe Jane Eyre of yesterday?—where was her life?—where were her\nprospects?\n\nJane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman—almost a bride, was\na cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were\ndesolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December\nstorm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed\nthe blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes\nwhich last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with\nuntrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and\nfragrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and\nwhite as pine-forests in wintry Norway. My hopes were all dead—struck\nwith a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born\nin the land of Egypt. I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so\nblooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could\nnever revive. I looked at my love: that feeling which was my\nmaster’s—which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a\nsuffering child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it;\nit could not seek Mr. Rochester’s arms—it could not derive warmth from\nhis breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was\nblighted—confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had\nbeen; for he was not what I had thought him. I would not ascribe vice\nto him; I would not say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of\nstainless truth was gone from his idea, and from his presence I must\ngo: _that_ I perceived well. When—how—whither, I could not yet discern;\nbut he himself, I doubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield. Real\naffection, it seemed, he could not have for me; it had been only fitful\npassion: that was balked; he would want me no more. I should fear even\nto cross his path now: my view must be hateful to him. Oh, how blind\nhad been my eyes! How weak my conduct!\n\nMy eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round\nme, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.\nSelf-abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down\nin the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in\nremote mountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to\nflee I had no strength. I lay faint, longing to be dead. One idea only\nstill throbbed life-like within me—a remembrance of God: it begot an\nunuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless\nmind, as something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to\nexpress them—\n\n“Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.”\n\nIt was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it—as I\nhad neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips—it\ncame: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me. The whole\nconsciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith\ndeath-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass. That\nbitter hour cannot be described: in truth, “the waters came into my\nsoul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters;\nthe floods overflowed me.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nSome time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and\nseeing the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I\nasked, “What am I to do?”\n\nBut the answer my mind gave—“Leave Thornfield at once”—was so prompt,\nso dread, that I stopped my ears. I said I could not bear such words\nnow. “That I am not Edward Rochester’s bride is the least part of my\nwoe,” I alleged: “that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and\nfound them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but\nthat I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable. I\ncannot do it.”\n\nBut, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold\nthat I should do it. I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be\nweak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw\nlaid out for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the\nthroat, told her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in\nthe slough, and swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her\ndown to unsounded depths of agony.\n\n“Let me be torn away, then” I cried. “Let another help me!”\n\n“No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall\nyourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand:\nyour heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it.”\n\nI rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a\njudge haunted,—at the silence which so awful a voice filled. My head\nswam as I stood erect. I perceived that I was sickening from excitement\nand inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for\nI had taken no breakfast. And, with a strange pang, I now reflected\nthat, long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask\nhow I was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adèle had\ntapped at the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me. “Friends\nalways forget those whom fortune forsakes,” I murmured, as I undrew the\nbolt and passed out. I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still\ndizzy, my sight was dim, and my limbs were feeble. I could not soon\nrecover myself. I fell, but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm\ncaught me. I looked up—I was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a\nchair across my chamber threshold.\n\n“You come out at last,” he said. “Well, I have been waiting for you\nlong, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob:\nfive minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the\nlock like a burglar. So you shun me?—you shut yourself up and grieve\nalone! I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence. You\nare passionate: I expected a scene of some kind. I was prepared for the\nhot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a\nsenseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief. But I\nerr: you have not wept at all! I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but\nno trace of tears. I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?”\n\n“Well, Jane! not a word of reproach? Nothing bitter—nothing poignant?\nNothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion? You sit quietly where I\nhave placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look.\n\n“Jane, I never meant to wound you thus. If the man who had but one\nlittle ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his\nbread and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake\nslaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody\nblunder more than I now rue mine. Will you ever forgive me?”\n\nReader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot. There was such\ndeep remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy\nin his manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole\nlook and mien—I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only\nat my heart’s core.\n\n“You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?” ere long he inquired\nwistfully—wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,\nthe result rather of weakness than of will.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Then tell me so roundly and sharply—don’t spare me.”\n\n“I cannot: I am tired and sick. I want some water.” He heaved a sort of\nshuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs. At\nfirst I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my\nglazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for,\nsummer as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber. He put wine to\nmy lips; I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me,\nand was soon myself. I was in the library—sitting in his chair—he was\nquite near. “If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang,\nit would be well for me,” I thought; “then I should not have to make\nthe effort of cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr.\nRochester’s. I must leave him, it appears. I do not want to leave him—I\ncannot leave him.”\n\n“How are you now, Jane?”\n\n“Much better, sir; I shall be well soon.”\n\n“Taste the wine again, Jane.”\n\nI obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and\nlooked at me attentively. Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate\nexclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast\nthrough the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;\nbut I remembered caresses were now forbidden. I turned my face away and\nput his aside.\n\n“What!—How is this?” he exclaimed hastily. “Oh, I know! you won’t kiss\nthe husband of Bertha Mason? You consider my arms filled and my\nembraces appropriated?”\n\n“At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.”\n\n“Why, Jane? I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer\nfor you—Because I have a wife already, you would reply.—I guess\nrightly?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must\nregard me as a plotting profligate—a base and low rake who has been\nsimulating disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare\ndeliberately laid, and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.\nWhat do you say to that? I see you can say nothing: in the first place,\nyou are faint still, and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the\nsecond place, you cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me,\nand besides, the flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush\nout if you spoke much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to\nupbraid, to make a scene: you are thinking how _to act_—_talking_ you\nconsider is of no use. I know you—I am on my guard.”\n\n“Sir, I do not wish to act against you,” I said; and my unsteady voice\nwarned me to curtail my sentence.\n\n“Not in _your_ sense of the word, but in _mine_ you are scheming to\ndestroy me. You have as good as said that I am a married man—as a\nmarried man you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have\nrefused to kiss me. You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to\nme: to live under this roof only as Adèle’s governess; if ever I say a\nfriendly word to you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to\nme, you will say,—‘That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be\nice and rock to him;’ and ice and rock you will accordingly become.”\n\nI cleared and steadied my voice to reply: “All is changed about me,\nsir; I must change too—there is no doubt of that; and to avoid\nfluctuations of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and\nassociations, there is only one way—Adèle must have a new governess,\nsir.”\n\n“Oh, Adèle will go to school—I have settled that already; nor do I mean\nto torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of\nThornfield Hall—this accursed place—this tent of Achan—this insolent\nvault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the\nopen sky—this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a\nlegion of such as we imagine. Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will\nI. I was wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did\nhow it was haunted. I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever\nsaw you, all knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I\nfeared Adèle never would have a governess to stay if she knew with what\ninmate she was housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the\nmaniac elsewhere—though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even\nmore retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely\nenough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in\nthe heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.\nProbably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but\nto each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect\nassassination, even of what I most hate.\n\n“Concealing the mad-woman’s neighbourhood from you, however, was\nsomething like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a\nupas-tree: that demon’s vicinage is poisoned, and always was. But I’ll\nshut up Thornfield Hall: I’ll nail up the front door and board the\nlower windows: I’ll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here\nwith _my wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for\nmoney, and she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to\nbear her company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when\n_my wife_ is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at\nnight, to stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on—”\n\n“Sir,” I interrupted him, “you are inexorable for that unfortunate\nlady: you speak of her with hate—with vindictive antipathy. It is\ncruel—she cannot help being mad.”\n\n“Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you\ndon’t know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not\nbecause she is mad I hate her. If you were mad, do you think I should\nhate you?”\n\n“I do indeed, sir.”\n\n“Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing\nabout the sort of love of which I am capable. Every atom of your flesh\nis as dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be\ndear. Your mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my\ntreasure still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a\nstrait waistcoat—your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me:\nif you flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should\nreceive you in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.\nI should not shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your\nquiet moments you should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I\ncould hang over you with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no\nsmile in return; and never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they\nhad no longer a ray of recognition for me.—But why do I follow that\ntrain of ideas? I was talking of removing you from Thornfield. All, you\nknow, is prepared for prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go. I only\nask you to endure one more night under this roof, Jane; and then,\nfarewell to its miseries and terrors for ever! I have a place to repair\nto, which will be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from\nunwelcome intrusion—even from falsehood and slander.”\n\n“And take Adèle with you, sir,” I interrupted; “she will be a companion\nfor you.”\n\n“What do you mean, Jane? I told you I would send Adèle to school; and\nwhat do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,—a\nFrench dancer’s bastard? Why do you importune me about her! I say, why\ndo you assign Adèle to me for a companion?”\n\n“You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:\ntoo dull for you.”\n\n“Solitude! solitude!” he reiterated with irritation. “I see I must come\nto an explanation. I don’t know what sphynx-like expression is forming\nin your countenance. _You_ are to share my solitude. Do you\nunderstand?”\n\nI shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was\nbecoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent. He had been walking\nfast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.\nHe looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on\nthe fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.\n\n“Now for the hitch in Jane’s character,” he said at last, speaking more\ncalmly than from his look I had expected him to speak. “The reel of\nsilk has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come\na knot and a puzzle: here it is. Now for vexation, and exasperation,\nand endless trouble! By God! I long to exert a fraction of Samson’s\nstrength, and break the entanglement like tow!”\n\nHe recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just\nbefore me.\n\n“Jane! will you hear reason?” (he stooped and approached his lips to my\near); “because, if you won’t, I’ll try violence.” His voice was hoarse;\nhis look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond\nand plunge headlong into wild license. I saw that in another moment,\nand with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing\nwith him. The present—the passing second of time—was all I had in which\nto control and restrain him: a movement of repulsion, flight, fear\nwould have sealed my doom,—and his. But I was not afraid: not in the\nleast. I felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported\nme. The crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the\nIndian, perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe. I\ntook hold of his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and\nsaid to him, soothingly—\n\n“Sit down; I’ll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have\nto say, whether reasonable or unreasonable.”\n\nHe sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly. I had been\nstruggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress\nthem, because I knew he would not like to see me weep. Now, however, I\nconsidered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they\nliked. If the flood annoyed him, so much the better. So I gave way and\ncried heartily.\n\nSoon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed. I said I could\nnot while he was in such a passion.\n\n“But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had\nsteeled your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I\ncould not endure it. Hush, now, and wipe your eyes.”\n\nHis softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,\nbecame calm. Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but\nI would not permit it. Then he would draw me to him: no.\n\n“Jane! Jane!” he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled\nalong every nerve I had; “you don’t love me, then? It was only my\nstation, and the rank of my wife, that you valued? Now that you think\nme disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if\nI were some toad or ape.”\n\nThese words cut me: yet what could I do or I say? I ought probably to\nhave done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse\nat thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm\nwhere I had wounded.\n\n“I _do_ love you,” I said, “more than ever: but I must not show or\nindulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it.”\n\n“The last time, Jane! What! do you think you can live with me, and see\nme daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?”\n\n“No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is\nbut one way: but you will be furious if I mention it.”\n\n“Oh, mention it! If I storm, you have the art of weeping.”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I must leave you.”\n\n“For how long, Jane? For a few minutes, while you smooth your\nhair—which is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face—which looks\nfeverish?”\n\n“I must leave Adèle and Thornfield. I must part with you for my whole\nlife: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange\nscenes.”\n\n“Of course: I told you you should. I pass over the madness about\nparting from me. You mean you must become a part of me. As to the new\nexistence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.\nYou shall be Mrs. Rochester—both virtually and nominally. I shall keep\nonly to you so long as you and I live. You shall go to a place I have\nin the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the\nMediterranean. There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most\ninnocent life. Never fear that I wish to lure you into error—to make\nyou my mistress. Why did you shake your head? Jane, you must be\nreasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic.”\n\nHis voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye\nblazed: still I dared to speak.\n\n“Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by\nyourself. If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your\nmistress: to say otherwise is sophistical—is false.”\n\n“Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man—you forget that: I am not\nlong-enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate. Out of pity to me and\nyourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and—beware!”\n\nHe bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his\ncheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.\nTo agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel:\nto yield was out of the question. I did what human beings do\ninstinctively when they are driven to utter extremity—looked for aid to\none higher than man: the words “God help me!” burst involuntarily from\nmy lips.\n\n“I am a fool!” cried Mr. Rochester suddenly. “I keep telling her I am\nnot married, and do not explain to her why. I forget she knows nothing\nof the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my\ninfernal union with her. Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in\nopinion, when she knows all that I know! Just put your hand in mine,\nJanet—that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove\nyou are near me—and I will in a few words show you the real state of\nthe case. Can you listen to me?”\n\n“Yes, sir; for hours if you will.”\n\n“I ask only minutes. Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the\neldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?”\n\n“I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.”\n\n“And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?”\n\n“I have understood something to that effect.”\n\n“Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property\ntogether; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving\nme a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.\nYet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man. I\nmust be provided for by a wealthy marriage. He sought me a partner\nbetimes. Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old\nacquaintance. He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he\nmade inquiries. Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he\nlearned from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of\nthirty thousand pounds: that sufficed. When I left college, I was sent\nout to Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me. My father\nsaid nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast\nof Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie. I found her a fine\nwoman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic. Her\nfamily wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did\nshe. They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed. I seldom saw\nher alone, and had very little private conversation with her. She\nflattered me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and\naccomplishments. All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and\nenvy me. I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being\nignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her. There is no\nfolly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,\nthe rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its\ncommission. Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she\nallured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.\nOh, I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!—an agony of\ninward contempt masters me. I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not\neven know her. I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her\nnature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor\nrefinement in her mind or manners—and, I married her:—gross,\ngrovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was! With less sin I might\nhave—But let me remember to whom I am speaking.\n\n“My bride’s mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead. The\nhoneymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in\na lunatic asylum. There was a younger brother, too—a complete dumb\nidiot. The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate,\nwhilst I abhor all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection\nin his feeble mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his\nwretched sister, and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me),\nwill probably be in the same state one day. My father and my brother\nRowland knew all this; but they thought only of the thirty thousand\npounds, and joined in the plot against me.\n\n“These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of\nconcealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,\neven when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious\nto me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable\nof being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger—when I\nfound that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of\nthe day with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be\nsustained between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately\nreceived from her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and\nimbecile—when I perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled\nhousehold, because no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her\nviolent and unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd,\ncontradictory, exacting orders—even then I restrained myself: I\neschewed upbraiding, I curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my\nrepentance and disgust in secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I\nfelt.\n\n“Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong\nwords shall express what I have to say. I lived with that woman\nupstairs four years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her\ncharacter ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices\nsprang up fast and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check\nthem, and I would not use cruelty. What a pigmy intellect she had, and\nwhat giant propensities! How fearful were the curses those propensities\nentailed on me! Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother,\ndragged me through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must\nattend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.\n\n“My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years\nmy father died too. I was rich enough now—yet poor to hideous\nindigence: a nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was\nassociated with mine, and called by the law and by society a part of\nme. And I could not rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the\ndoctors now discovered that _my wife_ was mad—her excesses had\nprematurely developed the germs of insanity. Jane, you don’t like my\nnarrative; you look almost sick—shall I defer the rest to another day?”\n\n“No, sir, finish it now; I pity you—I do earnestly pity you.”\n\n“Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of\ntribute, which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those\nwho offer it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish\nhearts; it is a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed\nwith ignorant contempt for those who have endured them. But that is not\nyour pity, Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full\nat this moment—with which your eyes are now almost overflowing—with\nwhich your heart is heaving—with which your hand is trembling in mine.\nYour pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is\nthe very natal pang of the divine passion. I accept it, Jane; let the\ndaughter have free advent—my arms wait to receive her.”\n\n“Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?”\n\n“Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was\nall that intervened between me and the gulf. In the eyes of the world,\nI was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be\nclean in my own sight—and to the last I repudiated the contamination of\nher crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental\ndefects. Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet\nsaw her and heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed\nwith the air I breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her\nhusband—that recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to\nme; moreover, I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband\nof another and better wife; and, though five years my senior (her\nfamily and her father had lied to me even in the particular of her\nage), she was likely to live as long as I, being as robust in frame as\nshe was infirm in mind. Thus, at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.\n\n“One night I had been awakened by her yells—(since the medical men had\npronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)—it was a fiery\nWest Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the\nhurricanes of those climates. Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up\nand opened the window. The air was like sulphur-steams—I could find no\nrefreshment anywhere. Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly\nround the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull\nlike an earthquake—black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was\nsetting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball—she threw\nher last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of\ntempest. I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and\nmy ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out;\nwherein she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate,\nwith such language!—no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary\nthan she: though two rooms off, I heard every word—the thin partitions\nof the West India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish\ncries.\n\n“‘This life,’ said I at last, ‘is hell: this is the air—those are the\nsounds of the bottomless pit! I have a right to deliver myself from it\nif I can. The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the\nheavy flesh that now cumbers my soul. Of the fanatic’s burning eternity\nI have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present\none—let me break away, and go home to God!’\n\n“I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which\ncontained a brace of loaded pistols: I meant to shoot myself. I only\nentertained the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the\ncrisis of exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the\nwish and design of self-destruction, was past in a second.\n\n“A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the\nopen casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the\nair grew pure. I then framed and fixed a resolution. While I walked\nunder the dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its\ndrenched pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of\nthe tropics kindled round me—I reasoned thus, Jane—and now listen; for\nit was true Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the\nright path to follow.\n\n“The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed\nleaves, and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart,\ndried up and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled\nwith living blood—my being longed for renewal—my soul thirsted for a\npure draught. I saw hope revive—and felt regeneration possible. From a\nflowery arch at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea—bluer than\nthe sky: the old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:—\n\n“‘Go,’ said Hope, ‘and live again in Europe: there it is not known what\na sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you. You\nmay take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due\nattendance and precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what\nclime you will, and form what new tie you like. That woman, who has so\nabused your long-suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your\nhonour, so blighted your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her\nhusband. See that she is cared for as her condition demands, and you\nhave done all that God and humanity require of you. Let her identity,\nher connection with yourself, be buried in oblivion: you are bound to\nimpart them to no living being. Place her in safety and comfort:\nshelter her degradation with secrecy, and leave her.’\n\n“I acted precisely on this suggestion. My father and brother had not\nmade my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very\nfirst letter I wrote to apprise them of the union—having already begun\nto experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family\ncharacter and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me—I\nadded an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous\nconduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make\nhim blush to own her as his daughter-in-law. Far from desiring to\npublish the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.\n\n“To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a\nmonster in the vessel. Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,\nand saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret\ninner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast’s den—a\ngoblin’s cell. I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as\nit was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be\nplaced; for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she\nhad lucid intervals of days—sometimes weeks—which she filled up with\nabuse of me. At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat. She\nand the surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason’s wounds that night he was\nstabbed and worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my\nconfidence. Mrs. Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she\ncould have gained no precise knowledge as to facts. Grace has, on the\nwhole, proved a good keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her\nown, of which it appears nothing can cure her, and which is incident to\nher harassing profession, her vigilance has been more than once lulled\nand baffled. The lunatic is both cunning and malignant; she has never\nfailed to take advantage of her guardian’s temporary lapses; once to\nsecrete the knife with which she stabbed her brother, and twice to\npossess herself of the key of her cell, and issue therefrom in the\nnight-time. On the first of these occasions, she perpetrated the\nattempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid that ghastly\nvisit to you. I thank Providence, who watched over you, that she then\nspent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps brought back\nvague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what might have\nhappened, I cannot endure to reflect. When I think of the thing which\nflew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet visage\nover the nest of my dove, my blood curdles—”\n\n“And what, sir,” I asked, while he paused, “did you do when you had\nsettled her here? Where did you go?”\n\n“What did I do, Jane? I transformed myself into a will-o’-the-wisp.\nWhere did I go? I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the\nMarch-spirit. I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its\nlands. My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent\nwoman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield—”\n\n“But you could not marry, sir.”\n\n“I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought. It was not\nmy original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you. I meant to\ntell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to\nme so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and\nbe loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to\nunderstand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I\nwas burdened.”\n\n“Well, sir?”\n\n“When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile. You open\nyour eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless\nmovement, as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and\nyou wanted to read the tablet of one’s heart. But before I go on, tell\nme what you mean by your ‘Well, sir?’ It is a small phrase very\nfrequent with you; and which many a time has drawn me on and on through\ninterminable talk: I don’t very well know why.”\n\n“I mean,—What next? How did you proceed? What came of such an event?”\n\n“Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?”\n\n“Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry\nyou; and what she said.”\n\n“I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked\nher to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of\nFate. For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital,\nthen another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris;\noccasionally in Rome, Naples, and Florence. Provided with plenty of\nmoney and the passport of an old name, I could choose my own society:\nno circles were closed against me. I sought my ideal of a woman amongst\nEnglish ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras, and German\ngräfinnen. I could not find her. Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I\nthought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced\nthe realisation of my dream: but I was presently undeceived. You are\nnot to suppose that I desired perfection, either of mind or person. I\nlonged only for what suited me—for the antipodes of the Creole: and I\nlonged vainly. Amongst them all I found not one whom, had I been ever\nso free, I—warned as I was of the risks, the horrors, the loathings of\nincongruous unions—would have asked to marry me. Disappointment made me\nreckless. I tried dissipation—never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.\nThat was my Indian Messalina’s attribute: rooted disgust at it and her\nrestrained me much, even in pleasure. Any enjoyment that bordered on\nriot seemed to approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.\n\n“Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of\nmistresses. The first I chose was Céline Varens—another of those steps\nwhich make a man spurn himself when he recalls them. You already know\nwhat she was, and how my liaison with her terminated. She had two\nsuccessors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered\nsingularly handsome. What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?\nGiacinta was unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.\nClara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not\none whit to my taste. I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set\nher up in a good line of business, and so get decently rid of her. But,\nJane, I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion\nof me just now. You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don’t\nyou?”\n\n“I don’t like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir. Did it\nnot seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one\nmistress and then another? You talk of it as a mere matter of course.”\n\n“It was with me; and I did not like it. It was a grovelling fashion of\nexistence: I should never like to return to it. Hiring a mistress is\nthe next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and\nalways by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is\ndegrading. I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with\nCéline, Giacinta, and Clara.”\n\nI felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain\ninference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching\nthat had ever been instilled into me, as—under any pretext—with any\njustification—through any temptation—to become the successor of these\npoor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now\nin his mind desecrated their memory. I did not give utterance to this\nconviction: it was enough to feel it. I impressed it on my heart, that\nit might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.\n\n“Now, Jane, why don’t you say ‘Well, sir?’ I have not done. You are\nlooking grave. You disapprove of me still, I see. But let me come to\nthe point. Last January, rid of all mistresses—in a harsh, bitter frame\nof mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life—corroded with\ndisappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against\nall _woman_kind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,\nfaithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came\nback to England.\n\n“On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.\nAbhorred spot! I expected no peace—no pleasure there. On a stile in Hay\nLane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself. I passed it as\nnegligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no\npresentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the\narbitress of my life—my genius for good or evil—waited there in humble\nguise. I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour’s\naccident, it came up and gravely offered me help. Childish and slender\ncreature! It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed\nto bear me on its tiny wing. I was surly; but the thing would not go:\nit stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a\nsort of authority. I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.\n\n“When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new—a fresh sap\nand sense—stole into my frame. It was well I had learnt that this elf\nmust return to me—that it belonged to my house down below—or I could\nnot have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish\nbehind the dim hedge, without singular regret. I heard you come home\nthat night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of\nyou or watched for you. The next day I observed you—myself unseen—for\nhalf-an-hour, while you played with Adèle in the gallery. It was a\nsnowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out of doors. I was in my\nroom; the door was ajar: I could both listen and watch. Adèle claimed\nyour outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were\nelsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you\ntalked to her and amused her a long time. When at last she left you,\nyou lapsed at once into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to\npace the gallery. Now and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out\nat the thick-falling snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again\nyou paced gently on and dreamed. I think those day visions were not\ndark: there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a\nsoft excitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious,\nhypochondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of\nyouth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up\nand on to an ideal heaven. The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a\nservant in the hall, wakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and\nat yourself, Janet! There was much sense in your smile: it was very\nshrewd, and seemed to make light of your own abstraction. It seemed to\nsay—‘My fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they are\nabsolutely unreal. I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my\nbrain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough tract\nto travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter.’ You ran\ndownstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly\nhouse accounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think it was. I\nwas vexed with you for getting out of my sight.\n\n“Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my\npresence. An unusual—to me—a perfectly new character I suspected was\nyours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better. You entered\nthe room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were\nquaintly dressed—much as you are now. I made you talk: ere long I found\nyou full of strange contrasts. Your garb and manner were restricted by\nrule; your air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined\nby nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of\nmaking herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or\nblunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing\neye to your interlocutor’s face: there was penetration and power in\neach glance you gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready\nand round answers. Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe\nyou felt the existence of sympathy between you and your grim and cross\nmaster, Jane; for it was astonishing to see how quickly a certain\npleasant ease tranquillised your manner: snarl as I would, you showed\nno surprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at my moroseness; you\nwatched me, and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious\ngrace I cannot describe. I was at once content and stimulated with what\nI saw: I liked what I had seen, and wished to see more. Yet, for a long\ntime, I treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely. I was an\nintellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making\nthis novel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while\ntroubled with a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely its\nbloom would fade—the sweet charm of freshness would leave it. I did not\nthen know that it was no transitory blossom, but rather the radiant\nresemblance of one, cut in an indestructible gem. Moreover, I wished to\nsee whether you would seek me if I shunned you—but you did not; you\nkept in the schoolroom as still as your own desk and easel; if by\nchance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as little token of\nrecognition, as was consistent with respect. Your habitual expression\nin those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you\nwere not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little hope, and no\nactual pleasure. I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever\nthought of me, and resolved to find this out.\n\n“I resumed my notice of you. There was something glad in your glance,\nand genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social\nheart; it was the silent schoolroom—it was the tedium of your life—that\nmade you mournful. I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;\nkindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression,\nyour tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a\ngrateful happy accent. I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane,\nat this time: there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you\nglanced at me with a slight trouble—a hovering doubt: you did not know\nwhat my caprice might be—whether I was going to play the master and be\nstern, or the friend and be benignant. I was now too fond of you often\nto simulate the first whim; and, when I stretched my hand out\ncordially, such bloom and light and bliss rose to your young, wistful\nfeatures, I had much ado often to avoid straining you then and there to\nmy heart.”\n\n“Don’t talk any more of those days, sir,” I interrupted, furtively\ndashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me;\nfor I knew what I must do—and do soon—and all these reminiscences, and\nthese revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.\n\n“No, Jane,” he returned: “what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,\nwhen the Present is so much surer—the Future so much brighter?”\n\nI shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.\n\n“You see now how the case stands—do you not?” he continued. “After a\nyouth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary\nsolitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love—I have\nfound _you_. You are my sympathy—my better self—my good angel. I am\nbound to you with a strong attachment. I think you good, gifted,\nlovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans\nto you, draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence\nabout you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in\none.\n\n“It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you. To\ntell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I\nhad but a hideous demon. I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I\nfeared a stubbornness that exists in your character. I feared early\ninstilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding\nconfidences. This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your\nnobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do now—opened to you plainly\nmy life of agony—described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher\nand worthier existence—shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is\nweak), but my resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am\nfaithfully and well loved in return. Then I should have asked you to\naccept my pledge of fidelity and to give me yours. Jane—give it me\nnow.”\n\nA pause.\n\n“Why are you silent, Jane?”\n\nI was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.\nTerrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning! Not a human\nbeing that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved;\nand him who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce\nlove and idol. One drear word comprised my intolerable duty—“Depart!”\n\n“Jane, you understand what I want of you? Just this promise—‘I will be\nyours, Mr. Rochester.’”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours.”\n\nAnother long silence.\n\n“Jane!” recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with\ngrief, and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror—for this still\nvoice was the pant of a lion rising—“Jane, do you mean to go one way in\nthe world, and to let me go another?”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“Jane” (bending towards and embracing me), “do you mean it now?”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“And now?” softly kissing my forehead and cheek.\n\n“I do,” extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.\n\n“Oh, Jane, this is bitter! This—this is wicked. It would not be wicked\nto love me.”\n\n“It would to obey you.”\n\nA wild look raised his brows—crossed his features: he rose; but he\nforebore yet. I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I\nshook, I feared—but I resolved.\n\n“One instant, Jane. Give one glance to my horrible life when you are\ngone. All happiness will be torn away with you. What then is left? For\na wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to\nsome corpse in yonder churchyard. What shall I do, Jane? Where turn for\na companion and for some hope?”\n\n“Do as I do: trust in God and yourself. Believe in heaven. Hope to meet\nagain there.”\n\n“Then you will not yield?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?” His voice\nrose.\n\n“I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil.”\n\n“Then you snatch love and innocence from me? You fling me back on lust\nfor a passion—vice for an occupation?”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it\nfor myself. We were born to strive and endure—you as well as I: do so.\nYou will forget me before I forget you.”\n\n“You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour. I declared I\ncould not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon. And what\na distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is\nproved by your conduct! Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to\ndespair than to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by\nthe breach? for you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you\nneed fear to offend by living with me?”\n\nThis was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned\ntraitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him. They\nspoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly. “Oh,\ncomply!” it said. “Think of his misery; think of his danger—look at his\nstate when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the\nrecklessness following on despair—soothe him; save him; love him; tell\nhim you love him and will be his. Who in the world cares for _you_? or\nwho will be injured by what you do?”\n\nStill indomitable was the reply—“_I_ care for myself. The more\nsolitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I\nwill respect myself. I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by\nman. I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and\nnot mad—as I am now. Laws and principles are not for the times when\nthere is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body\nand soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they;\ninviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I might break\nthem, what would be their worth? They have a worth—so I have always\nbelieved; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am\ninsane—quite insane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating\nfaster than I can count its throbs. Preconceived opinions, foregone\ndeterminations, are all I have at this hour to stand by: there I plant\nmy foot.”\n\nI did. Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so. His\nfury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,\nwhatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped\nmy waist. He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I\nfelt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and\nglow of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the\ncertainty of ultimate safety. The soul, fortunately, has an\ninterpreter—often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter—in\nthe eye. My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I\ngave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed\nstrength almost exhausted.\n\n“Never,” said he, as he ground his teeth, “never was anything at once\nso frail and so indomitable. A mere reed she feels in my hand!” (And he\nshook me with the force of his hold.) “I could bend her with my finger\nand thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I\ncrushed her? Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing\nlooking out of it, defying me, with more than courage—with a stern\ntriumph. Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it—the savage,\nbeautiful creature! If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage\nwill only let the captive loose. Conqueror I might be of the house; but\nthe inmate would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor\nof its clay dwelling-place. And it is you, spirit—with will and energy,\nand virtue and purity—that I want: not alone your brittle frame. Of\nyourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart,\nif you would: seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like\nan essence—you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance. Oh! come, Jane,\ncome!”\n\nAs he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.\nThe look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an\nidiot, however, would have succumbed now. I had dared and baffled his\nfury; I must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.\n\n“You are going, Jane?”\n\n“I am going, sir.”\n\n“You are leaving me?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My deep\nlove, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?”\n\nWhat unutterable pathos was in his voice! How hard it was to reiterate\nfirmly, “I am going.”\n\n“Jane!”\n\n“Mr. Rochester!”\n\n“Withdraw, then,—I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.\nGo up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a\nglance on my sufferings—think of me.”\n\nHe turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa. “Oh, Jane! my\nhope—my love—my life!” broke in anguish from his lips. Then came a\ndeep, strong sob.\n\nI had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back—walked back\nas determinedly as I had retreated. I knelt down by him; I turned his\nface from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair\nwith my hand.\n\n“God bless you, my dear master!” I said. “God keep you from harm and\nwrong—direct you, solace you—reward you well for your past kindness to\nme.”\n\n“Little Jane’s love would have been my best reward,” he answered;\n“without it, my heart is broken. But Jane will give me her love:\nyes—nobly, generously.”\n\nUp the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;\nerect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at\nonce quitted the room.\n\n“Farewell!” was the cry of my heart as I left him. Despair added,\n“Farewell for ever!”\n\n\nThat night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon\nas I lay down in bed. I was transported in thought to the scenes of\nchildhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night\nwas dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears. The light that long\nago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed\nglidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of\nthe obscured ceiling. I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to\nclouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours\nshe is about to sever. I watched her come—watched with the strangest\nanticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written on her\ndisk. She broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first\npenetrated the sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a\nwhite human form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow\nearthward. It gazed and gazed on me. It spoke to my spirit:\nimmeasurably distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my\nheart—\n\n“My daughter, flee temptation.”\n\n“Mother, I will.”\n\nSo I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream. It was yet\nnight, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes. “It\ncannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil,” thought I.\nI rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes. I knew\nwhere to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring. In seeking\nthese articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr.\nRochester had forced me to accept a few days ago. I left that; it was\nnot mine: it was the visionary bride’s who had melted in air. The other\narticles I made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings\n(it was all I had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet,\npinned my shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put\non yet, and stole from my room.\n\n“Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!” I whispered, as I glided past her door.\n“Farewell, my darling Adèle!” I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.\nNo thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her. I had to\ndeceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.\n\nI would have got past Mr. Rochester’s chamber without a pause; but my\nheart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was\nforced to stop also. No sleep was there: the inmate was walking\nrestlessly from wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I\nlistened. There was a heaven—a temporary heaven—in this room for me, if\nI chose: I had but to go in and to say—\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till\ndeath,” and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips. I thought of\nthis.\n\nThat kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience\nfor day. He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone. He\nwould have me sought for: vainly. He would feel himself forsaken; his\nlove rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate. I thought of\nthis too. My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided\non.\n\nDrearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did\nit mechanically. I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I\nsought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the\nlock. I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to\nwalk far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.\nAll this I did without one sound. I opened the door, passed out, shut\nit softly. Dim dawn glimmered in the yard. The great gates were closed\nand locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched. Through that\nI departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.\n\nA mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the\ncontrary direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often\nnoticed, and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps. No\nreflection was to be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back;\nnot even one forward. Not one thought was to be given either to the\npast or the future. The first was a page so heavenly sweet—so deadly\nsad—that to read one line of it would dissolve my courage and break\ndown my energy. The last was an awful blank: something like the world\nwhen the deluge was gone by.\n\nI skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise. I believe\nit was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on\nwhen I left the house, were soon wet with dew. But I looked neither to\nrising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature. He who is taken out\nto pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers\nthat smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the\ndisseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I\nthought of drear flight and homeless wandering—and oh! with agony I\nthought of what I left. I could not help it. I thought of him now—in\nhis room—watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would\nstay with him and be his. I longed to be his; I panted to return: it\nwas not too late; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.\nAs yet my flight, I was sure, was undiscovered. I could go back and be\nhis comforter—his pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.\nOh, that fear of his self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonment—how\nit goaded me! It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when\nI tried to extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it\nfarther in. Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful\nto their mates; birds were emblems of love. What was I? In the midst of\nmy pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself. I\nhad no solace from self-approbation: none even from self-respect. I had\ninjured—wounded—left my master. I was hateful in my own eyes. Still I\ncould not turn, nor retrace one step. God must have led me on. As to my\nown will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled\nthe other. I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way:\nfast, fast I went like one delirious. A weakness, beginning inwardly,\nextending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some\nminutes, pressing my face to the wet turf. I had some fear—or hope—that\nhere I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and\nknees, and then again raised to my feet—as eager and as determined as\never to reach the road.\n\nWhen I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and\nwhile I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on. I stood up and\nlifted my hand; it stopped. I asked where it was going: the driver\nnamed a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no\nconnections. I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said\nthirty shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to\nmake it do. He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the\nvehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.\n\nGentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never\nshed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May\nyou never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in\nthat hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the\ninstrument of evil to what you wholly love.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nTwo days are passed. It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me\ndown at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the\nsum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the\nworld. The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone. At this moment\nI discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the\ncoach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it\nmust remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.\n\nWhitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set\nup where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at\na distance and in darkness. Four arms spring from its summit: the\nnearest town to which these point is, according to the inscription,\ndistant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty. From the well-known\nnames of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a\nnorth-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I\nsee. There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are\nwaves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet. The\npopulation here must be thin, and I see no passengers on these roads:\nthey stretch out east, west, north, and south—white, broad, lonely;\nthey are all cut in the moor, and the heather grows deep and wild to\ntheir very verge. Yet a chance traveller might pass by; and I wish no\neye to see me now: strangers would wonder what I am doing, lingering\nhere at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost. I might be\nquestioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and\nexcite suspicion. Not a tie holds me to human society at this\nmoment—not a charm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are—none\nthat saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me. I have no\nrelative but the universal mother, Nature: I will seek her breast and\nask repose.\n\nI struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply\nfurrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I\nturned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in\na hidden angle, I sat down under it. High banks of moor were about me;\nthe crag protected my head: the sky was over that.\n\nSome time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread\nthat wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might\ndiscover me. If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it\nwas the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.\nFinding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep\nsilence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took\nconfidence. As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched,\ndreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.\n\nWhat was I to do? Where to go? Oh, intolerable questions, when I could\ndo nothing and go nowhere!—when a long way must yet be measured by my\nweary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation—when cold\ncharity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant\nsympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale\ncould be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!\n\nI touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the\nsummer day. I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled\njust above the chasm ridge. The dew fell, but with propitious softness;\nno breeze whispered. Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she\nloved me, outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only\nmistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.\nTo-night, at least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother\nwould lodge me without money and without price. I had one morsel of\nbread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed\nthrough at noon with a stray penny—my last coin. I saw ripe bilberries\ngleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a\nhandful and ate them with the bread. My hunger, sharp before, was, if\nnot satisfied, appeased by this hermit’s meal. I said my evening\nprayers at its conclusion, and then chose my couch.\n\n\nI said my evening prayers\n\nBeside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were\nburied in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for\nthe night-air to invade. I folded my shawl double, and spread it over\nme for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow. Thus lodged, I was\nnot, at least at the commencement of the night, cold.\n\nMy rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it. It\nplained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords. It\ntrembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter\npity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird\nwith both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain\nattempts to seek him.\n\nWorn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees. Night was\ncome, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for\nthe companionship of fear. We know that God is everywhere; but\ncertainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest\nscale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His\nworlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude,\nHis omnipotence, His omnipresence. I had risen to my knees to pray for\nMr. Rochester. Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty\nMilky-way. Remembering what it was—what countless systems there swept\nspace like a soft trace of light—I felt the might and strength of God.\nSure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew\nthat neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured. I\nturned my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the\nSaviour of spirits. Mr. Rochester was safe: he was God’s, and by God\nwould he be guarded. I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere\nlong in sleep forgot sorrow.\n\nBut next day, Want came to me pale and bare. Long after the little\nbirds had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime\nof day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried—when the long\nmorning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky—I got\nup, and I looked round me.\n\nWhat a still, hot, perfect day! What a golden desert this spreading\nmoor! Everywhere sunshine. I wished I could live in it and on it. I saw\na lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet\nbilberries. I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that\nI might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here. But I was\na human being, and had a human being’s wants: I must not linger where\nthere was nothing to supply them. I rose; I looked back at the bed I\nhad left. Hopeless of the future, I wished but this—that my Maker had\nthat night thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and\nthat this weary frame, absolved by death from further conflict with\nfate, had now but to decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil\nof this wilderness. Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all\nits requirements, and pains, and responsibilities. The burden must be\ncarried; the want provided for; the suffering endured; the\nresponsibility fulfilled. I set out.\n\nWhitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now\nfervent and high. By no other circumstance had I will to decide my\nchoice. I walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done\nenough, and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost\noverpowered me—might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a\nstone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart\nand limb—I heard a bell chime—a church bell.\n\nI turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic\nhills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw\na hamlet and a spire. All the valley at my right hand was full of\npasture-fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran\nzig-zag through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the\nsombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea. Recalled by the rumbling of\nwheels to the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up\nthe hill, and not far beyond were two cows and their drover. Human life\nand human labour were near. I must struggle on: strive to live and bend\nto toil like the rest.\n\nAbout two o’clock P.M. I entered the village. At the bottom of its one\nstreet there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.\nI coveted a cake of bread. With that refreshment I could perhaps regain\na degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed. The\nwish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I\nwas amongst my fellow-beings. I felt it would be degrading to faint\nwith hunger on the causeway of a hamlet. Had I nothing about me I could\noffer in exchange for one of these rolls? I considered. I had a small\nsilk handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves. I could hardly\ntell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded. I did\nnot know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably\nthey would not; but I must try.\n\nI entered the shop: a woman was there. Seeing a respectably-dressed\nperson, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility. How\ncould she serve me? I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter\nthe request I had prepared. I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,\nthe creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd. I only\nbegged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired. Disappointed in\nthe expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request. She\npointed to a seat; I sank into it. I felt sorely urged to weep; but\nconscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained\nit. Soon I asked her “if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman\nin the village?”\n\n“Yes; two or three. Quite as many as there was employment for.”\n\nI reflected. I was driven to the point now. I was brought face to face\nwith Necessity. I stood in the position of one without a resource,\nwithout a friend, without a coin. I must do something. What? I must\napply somewhere. Where?\n\n“Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was\nwanted?”\n\n“Nay; she couldn’t say.”\n\n“What was the chief trade in this place? What did most of the people\ndo?”\n\n“Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver’s\nneedle-factory, and at the foundry.”\n\n“Did Mr. Oliver employ women?”\n\n“Nay; it was men’s work.”\n\n“And what do the women do?”\n\n“I knawn’t,” was the answer. “Some does one thing, and some another.\nPoor folk mun get on as they can.”\n\nShe seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I\nto importune her? A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently\nwanted. I took leave.\n\nI passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the\nright hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an\ninducement to enter any. I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to\na little distance and returning again, for an hour or more. Much\nexhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside\ninto a lane and sat down under the hedge. Ere many minutes had elapsed,\nI was again on my feet, however, and again searching something—a\nresource, or at least an informant. A pretty little house stood at the\ntop of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and\nbrilliantly blooming. I stopped at it. What business had I to approach\nthe white door or touch the glittering knocker? In what way could it\npossibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve\nme? Yet I drew near and knocked. A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young\nwoman opened the door. In such a voice as might be expected from a\nhopeless heart and fainting frame—a voice wretchedly low and\nfaltering—I asked if a servant was wanted here?\n\n“No,” said she; “we do not keep a servant.”\n\n“Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?” I\ncontinued. “I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place. I want\nsome work: no matter what.”\n\nBut it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:\nbesides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,\nposition, tale. She shook her head, she “was sorry she could give me no\ninformation,” and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but\nit shut me out. If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I\nshould have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.\n\nI could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no\nprospect of aid was visible. I should have longed rather to deviate to\na wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer\ninviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature’s\ncravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a\nchance of food. Solitude would be no solitude—rest no rest—while the\nvulture, hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.\n\nI drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I\nwandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim\nto ask—no right to expect interest in my isolated lot. Meantime, the\nafternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and\nstarving dog. In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I\nhastened towards it. Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a\ngarden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was\nthe parsonage. I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where\nthey have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the\nclergyman for introduction and aid. It is the clergyman’s function to\nhelp—at least with advice—those who wished to help themselves. I seemed\nto have something like a right to seek counsel here. Renewing then my\ncourage, and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on. I\nreached the house, and knocked at the kitchen-door. An old woman\nopened: I asked was this the parsonage?\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Was the clergyman in?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Would he be in soon?”\n\n“No, he was gone from home.”\n\n“To a distance?”\n\n“Not so far—happen three mile. He had been called away by the sudden\ndeath of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely\nstay there a fortnight longer.”\n\n“Was there any lady of the house?”\n\n“Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;” and of her,\nreader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was\nsinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.\n\nOnce more I took off my handkerchief—once more I thought of the cakes\nof bread in the little shop. Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful\nto allay the pang of famine! Instinctively I turned my face again to\nthe village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others\nwere there besides the woman I ventured the request—“Would she give me\na roll for this handkerchief?”\n\nShe looked at me with evident suspicion: “Nay, she never sold stuff i’\nthat way.”\n\nAlmost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused. “How\ncould she tell where I had got the handkerchief?” she said.\n\n“Would she take my gloves?”\n\n“No! what could she do with them?”\n\nReader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some say there is\nenjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I\ncan scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral\ndegradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a\nrecollection ever to be willingly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who\nrepulsed me. I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not\nbe helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a\nwell-dressed beggar inevitably so. To be sure, what I begged was\nemployment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?\nNot, certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and\nwho knew nothing about my character. And as to the woman who would not\ntake my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if\nthe offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable. Let me\ncondense now. I am sick of the subject.\n\nA little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which\nthe farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese. I\nstopped and said—\n\n“Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry.” He cast on\nme a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice\nfrom his loaf, and gave it to me. I imagine he did not think I was a\nbeggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to\nhis brown loaf. As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down\nand ate it.\n\nI could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the\nwood I have before alluded to. But my night was wretched, my rest\nbroken: the ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed\nnear me more than once, and I had again and again to change my\nquarters: no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me. Towards\nmorning it rained; the whole of the following day was wet. Do not ask\nme, reader, to give a minute account of that day; as before, I sought\nwork; as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did\nfood pass my lips. At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl about\nto throw a mess of cold porridge into a pig trough. “Will you give me\nthat?” I asked.\n\n\n“Will you give me that?” I asked\n\nShe stared at me. “Mother!” she exclaimed, “there is a woman wants me\nto give her these porridge.”\n\n“Well lass,” replied a voice within, “give it her if she’s a beggar. T’\npig doesn’t want it.”\n\nThe girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it\nravenously.\n\nAs the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path,\nwhich I had been pursuing an hour or more.\n\n“My strength is quite failing me,” I said in a soliloquy. “I feel I\ncannot go much farther. Shall I be an outcast again this night? While\nthe rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?\nI fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me? But it will be\nvery dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this\nsense of desolation—this total prostration of hope. In all likelihood,\nthough, I should die before morning. And why cannot I reconcile myself\nto the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?\nBecause I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die\nof want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. Oh,\nProvidence! sustain me a little longer! Aid!—direct me!”\n\nMy glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape. I saw I had\nstrayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight. The very\ncultivation surrounding it had disappeared. I had, by cross-ways and\nby-paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a\nfew fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which\nthey were scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.\n\n“Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented\nroad,” I reflected. “And far better that crows and ravens—if any ravens\nthere be in these regions—should pick my flesh from my bones, than that\nthey should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper’s\ngrave.”\n\nTo the hill, then, I turned. I reached it. It remained now only to find\na hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not\nsecure. But all the surface of the waste looked level. It showed no\nvariation but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes;\nblack, where the dry soil bore only heath. Dark as it was getting, I\ncould still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light\nand shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.\n\nMy eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,\nvanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in\namong the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up. “That is an _ignis\nfatuus_,” was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish. It\nburnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing. “Is\nit, then, a bonfire just kindled?” I questioned. I watched to see\nwhether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not\nenlarge. “It may be a candle in a house,” I then conjectured; “but if\nso, I can never reach it. It is much too far away: and were it within a\nyard of me, what would it avail? I should but knock at the door to have\nit shut in my face.”\n\nAnd I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground. I\nlay still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and\ndied moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to\nthe skin. Could I but have stiffened to the still frost—the friendly\nnumbness of death—it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;\nbut my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence. I rose ere\nlong.\n\nThe light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain. I\ntried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it. It\nled me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been\nimpassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the\nheight of summer. Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my\nfaculties. This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.\n\nHaving crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor. I\napproached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the\nlight, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of\ntrees—firs, apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character\nof their forms and foliage through the gloom. My star vanished as I\ndrew near: some obstacle had intervened between me and it. I put out my\nhand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones\nof a low wall—above it, something like palisades, and within, a high\nand prickly hedge. I groped on. Again a whitish object gleamed before\nme: it was a gate—a wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it. On\neach side stood a sable bush—holly or yew.\n\nEntering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house\nrose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone\nnowhere. All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? I feared\nit must be so. In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out\nthe friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small\nlatticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the\ngrowth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered\nthick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set. The\naperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been\ndeemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of\nfoliage shooting over it, I could see all within. I could see clearly a\nroom with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with\npewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a\nglowing peat-fire. I could see a clock, a white deal table, some\nchairs. The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table;\nand by its light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but\nscrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a stocking.\n\nI noticed these objects cursorily only—in them there was nothing\nextraordinary. A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,\nsitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it. Two young,\ngraceful women—ladies in every point—sat, one in a low rocking-chair,\nthe other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and\nbombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and\nfaces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of\none girl—in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.\n\nA strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants! Who were\nthey? They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the\ntable; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and\ncultivation. I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I\ngazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament. I cannot call\nthem handsome—they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each\nbent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity. A stand\nbetween them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which\nthey frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller\nbooks they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to\naid them in the task of translation. This scene was as silent as if all\nthe figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so\nhushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock\ntick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the\nclick-click of the woman’s knitting-needles. When, therefore, a voice\nbroke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.\n\n“Listen, Diana,” said one of the absorbed students; “Franz and old\nDaniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream\nfrom which he has awakened in terror—listen!” And in a low voice she\nread something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it\nwas in an unknown tongue—neither French nor Latin. Whether it were\nGreek or German I could not tell.\n\n“That is strong,” she said, when she had finished: “I relish it.” The\nother girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,\nwhile she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read. At a later\nday, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the\nline: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on\nsounding brass to me—conveying no meaning:—\n\n“‘Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.’ Good! good!”\nshe exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled. “There you have a\ndim and mighty archangel fitly set before you! The line is worth a\nhundred pages of fustian. ‘Ich wäge die Gedanken in der Schale meines\nZornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.’ I like it!”\n\nBoth were again silent.\n\n“Is there ony country where they talk i’ that way?” asked the old\nwoman, looking up from her knitting.\n\n“Yes, Hannah—a far larger country than England, where they talk in no\nother way.”\n\n“Well, for sure case, I knawn’t how they can understand t’ one t’other:\nand if either o’ ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?”\n\n“We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all—for we\nare not as clever as you think us, Hannah. We don’t speak German, and\nwe cannot read it without a dictionary to help us.”\n\n“And what good does it do you?”\n\n“We mean to teach it some time—or at least the elements, as they say;\nand then we shall get more money than we do now.”\n\n“Varry like: but give ower studying; ye’ve done enough for to-night.”\n\n“I think we have: at least I’m tired. Mary, are you?”\n\n“Mortally: after all, it’s tough work fagging away at a language with\nno master but a lexicon.”\n\n“It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious\nDeutsch. I wonder when St. John will come home.”\n\n“Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little\ngold watch she drew from her girdle). It rains fast, Hannah: will you\nhave the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?”\n\nThe woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:\nsoon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.\n\n“Ah, childer!” said she, “it fair troubles me to go into yond’ room\nnow: it looks so lonesome wi’ the chair empty and set back in a\ncorner.”\n\nShe wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked\nsad now.\n\n“But he is in a better place,” continued Hannah: “we shouldn’t wish him\nhere again. And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had.”\n\n“You say he never mentioned us?” inquired one of the ladies.\n\n“He hadn’t time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father. He\nhad been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and\nwhen Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o’ ye to be sent for,\nhe fair laughed at him. He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his\nhead the next day—that is, a fortnight sin’—and he went to sleep and\nniver wakened: he wor a’most stark when your brother went into t’\nchamber and fand him. Ah, childer! that’s t’ last o’ t’ old stock—for\nye and Mr. St. John is like of different soart to them ’at’s gone; for\nall your mother wor mich i’ your way, and a’most as book-learned. She\nwor the pictur’ o’ ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father.”\n\nI thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for\nsuch I now concluded her to be) saw the difference. Both were fair\ncomplexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of\ndistinction and intelligence. One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker\nthan the other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing\nit; Mary’s pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana’s\nduskier tresses covered her neck with thick curls. The clock struck\nten.\n\n“Ye’ll want your supper, I am sure,” observed Hannah; “and so will Mr.\nSt. John when he comes in.”\n\nAnd she proceeded to prepare the meal. The ladies rose; they seemed\nabout to withdraw to the parlour. Till this moment, I had been so\nintent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited\nin me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched\nposition: now it recurred to me. More desolate, more desperate than\never, it seemed from contrast. And how impossible did it appear to\ntouch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to make them\nbelieve in the truth of my wants and woes—to induce them to vouchsafe a\nrest for my wanderings! As I groped out the door, and knocked at it\nhesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera. Hannah\nopened.\n\n“What do you want?” she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she\nsurveyed me by the light of the candle she held.\n\n“May I speak to your mistresses?” I said.\n\n“You had better tell me what you have to say to them. Where do you come\nfrom?”\n\n“I am a stranger.”\n\n“What is your business here at this hour?”\n\n“I want a night’s shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of\nbread to eat.”\n\nDistrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah’s face. “I’ll\ngive you a piece of bread,” she said, after a pause; “but we can’t take\nin a vagrant to lodge. It isn’t likely.”\n\n“Do let me speak to your mistresses.”\n\n“No, not I. What can they do for you? You should not be roving about\nnow; it looks very ill.”\n\n“But where shall I go if you drive me away? What shall I do?”\n\n“Oh, I’ll warrant you know where to go and what to do. Mind you don’t\ndo wrong, that’s all. Here is a penny; now go—”\n\n“A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther. Don’t\nshut the door:—oh, don’t, for God’s sake!”\n\n“I must; the rain is driving in—”\n\n“Tell the young ladies. Let me see them—”\n\n“Indeed, I will not. You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn’t\nmake such a noise. Move off.”\n\n“But I must die if I am turned away.”\n\n“Not you. I’m fear’d you have some ill plans agate, that bring you\nabout folk’s houses at this time o’ night. If you’ve any\nfollowers—housebreakers or such like—anywhere near, you may tell them\nwe are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs,\nand guns.” Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to\nand bolted it within.\n\nThis was the climax. A pang of exquisite suffering—a throe of true\ndespair—rent and heaved my heart. Worn out, indeed, I was; not another\nstep could I stir. I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned—I wrung my\nhands—I wept in utter anguish. Oh, this spectre of death! Oh, this last\nhour, approaching in such horror! Alas, this isolation—this banishment\nfrom my kind! Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of fortitude\nwas gone—at least for a moment; but the last I soon endeavoured to\nregain.\n\n“I can but die,” I said, “and I believe in God. Let me try to wait His\nwill in silence.”\n\nThese words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my\nmisery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain\nthere—dumb and still.\n\n“All men must die,” said a voice quite close at hand; “but all are not\ncondemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would\nbe if you perished here of want.”\n\n“Who or what speaks?” I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and\nincapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid. A form was\nnear—what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented\nme from distinguishing. With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed\nto the door.\n\n“Is it you, Mr. St. John?” cried Hannah.\n\n“Yes—yes; open quickly.”\n\n“Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is! Come\nin—your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad\nfolks about. There has been a beggar-woman—I declare she is not gone\nyet!—laid down there. Get up! for shame! Move off, I say!”\n\n“Hush, Hannah! I have a word to say to the woman. You have done your\nduty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her. I was near, and\nlistened to both you and her. I think this is a peculiar case—I must at\nleast examine into it. Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the\nhouse.”\n\n\nHush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman\n\nWith difficulty I obeyed him. Presently I stood within that clean,\nbright kitchen—on the very hearth—trembling, sickening; conscious of an\naspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten. The two\nladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing\nat me.\n\n“St. John, who is it?” I heard one ask.\n\n“I cannot tell: I found her at the door,” was the reply.\n\n“She does look white,” said Hannah.\n\n“As white as clay or death,” was responded. “She will fall: let her\nsit.”\n\nAnd indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me. I still\npossessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.\n\n“Perhaps a little water would restore her. Hannah, fetch some. But she\nis worn to nothing. How very thin, and how very bloodless!”\n\n“A mere spectre!”\n\n“Is she ill, or only famished?”\n\n“Famished, I think. Hannah, is that milk? Give it me, and a piece of\nbread.”\n\nDiana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and\nthe fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and\nput it to my lips. Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,\nand I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing. In her simple words, too,\nthe same balm-like emotion spoke: “Try to eat.”\n\n“Yes—try,” repeated Mary gently; and Mary’s hand removed my sodden\nbonnet and lifted my head. I tasted what they offered me: feebly at\nfirst, eagerly soon.\n\n“Not too much at first—restrain her,” said the brother; “she has had\nenough.” And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.\n\n“A little more, St. John—look at the avidity in her eyes.”\n\n“No more at present, sister. Try if she can speak now—ask her her\nname.”\n\nI felt I could speak, and I answered—“My name is Jane Elliott.” Anxious\nas ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.\n\n“And where do you live? Where are your friends?”\n\nI was silent.\n\n“Can we send for any one you know?”\n\nI shook my head.\n\n“What account can you give of yourself?”\n\nSomehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and\nonce was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer\noutcast, vagrant, and disowned by the wide world. I dared to put off\nthe mendicant—to resume my natural manner and character. I began once\nmore to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account—which at\npresent I was far too weak to render—I said after a brief pause—\n\n“Sir, I can give you no details to-night.”\n\n“But what, then,” said he, “do you expect me to do for you?”\n\n“Nothing,” I replied. My strength sufficed for but short answers. Diana\ntook the word—\n\n“Do you mean,” she asked, “that we have now given you what aid you\nrequire? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?”\n\nI looked at her. She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct\nboth with power and goodness. I took sudden courage. Answering her\ncompassionate gaze with a smile, I said—“I will trust you. If I were a\nmasterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your\nhearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear. Do with me and for me\nas you like; but excuse me from much discourse—my breath is short—I\nfeel a spasm when I speak.” All three surveyed me, and all three were\nsilent.\n\n“Hannah,” said Mr. St. John, at last, “let her sit there at present,\nand ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder\nof that milk and bread. Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and\ntalk the matter over.”\n\nThey withdrew. Very soon one of the ladies returned—I could not tell\nwhich. A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the\ngenial fire. In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah. Ere\nlong, with the servant’s aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my\ndripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me. I\nthanked God—experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of\ngrateful joy—and slept.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nThe recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very\ndim in my mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but\nfew thoughts framed, and no actions performed. I knew I was in a small\nroom and in a narrow bed. To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on\nit motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been\nalmost to kill me. I took no note of the lapse of time—of the change\nfrom morning to noon, from noon to evening. I observed when any one\nentered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could\nunderstand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could\nnot answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.\nHannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor. Her coming disturbed\nme. I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not\nunderstand me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.\nDiana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day. They would\nwhisper sentences of this sort at my bedside—\n\n“It is very well we took her in.”\n\n“Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the\nmorning had she been left out all night. I wonder what she has gone\nthrough?”\n\n“Strange hardships, I imagine—poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer!”\n\n“She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of\nspeaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off,\nthough splashed and wet, were little worn and fine.”\n\n“She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like\nit; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy\nwould be agreeable.”\n\nNever once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the\nhospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion\nto, myself. I was comforted.\n\nMr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of\nlethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted\nfatigue. He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was\nsure, would manage best, left to herself. He said every nerve had been\noverstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a\nwhile. There was no disease. He imagined my recovery would be rapid\nenough when once commenced. These opinions he delivered in a few words,\nin a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man\nlittle accustomed to expansive comment, “Rather an unusual physiognomy;\ncertainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.”\n\n“Far otherwise,” responded Diana. “To speak truth, St. John, my heart\nrather warms to the poor little soul. I wish we may be able to benefit\nher permanently.”\n\n“That is hardly likely,” was the reply. “You will find she is some\nyoung lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has\nprobably injudiciously left them. We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring\nher to them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her\nface which make me sceptical of her tractability.” He stood considering\nme some minutes; then added, “She looks sensible, but not at all\nhandsome.”\n\n“She is so ill, St. John.”\n\n“Ill or well, she would always be plain. The grace and harmony of\nbeauty are quite wanting in those features.”\n\nOn the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise\nin bed, and turn. Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast,\nabout, as I supposed, the dinner-hour. I had eaten with relish: the\nfood was good—void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned\nwhat I had swallowed. When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and\nrevived: ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me. I\nwished to rise; but what could I put on? Only my damp and bemired\napparel; in which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh. I\nfelt ashamed to appear before my benefactors so clad. I was spared the\nhumiliation.\n\nOn a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry. My\nblack silk frock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were\nremoved from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite\ndecent. My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered\npresentable. There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb\nand brush to smooth my hair. After a weary process, and resting every\nfive minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. My clothes hung loose on\nme; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and\nonce more, clean and respectable looking—no speck of the dirt, no trace\nof the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left—I\ncrept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow\nlow passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.\n\nIt was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous\nfire. Hannah was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are most\ndifficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been\nloosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds\namong stones. Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first:\nlatterly she had begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in\ntidy and well-dressed, she even smiled.\n\n“What, you have got up!” she said. “You are better, then. You may sit\nyou down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will.”\n\nShe pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled about,\nexamining me every now and then with the corner of her eye. Turning to\nme, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly—\n\n“Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?”\n\nI was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the\nquestion, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered\nquietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness—\n\n“You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar. I am no beggar; any more\nthan yourself or your young ladies.”\n\nAfter a pause she said, “I dunnut understand that: you’ve like no\nhouse, nor no brass, I guess?”\n\n“The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does\nnot make a beggar in your sense of the word.”\n\n“Are you book-learned?” she inquired presently.\n\n“Yes, very.”\n\n“But you’ve never been to a boarding-school?”\n\n“I was at a boarding-school eight years.”\n\nShe opened her eyes wide. “Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?”\n\n“I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again. What are\nyou going to do with these gooseberries?” I inquired, as she brought\nout a basket of the fruit.\n\n“Mak’ ’em into pies.”\n\n“Give them to me and I’ll pick them.”\n\n“Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought.”\n\n“But I must do something. Let me have them.”\n\nShe consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my\ndress, “lest,” as she said, “I should mucky it.”\n\n“Ye’ve not been used to sarvant’s wark, I see by your hands,” she\nremarked. “Happen ye’ve been a dressmaker?”\n\n“No, you are wrong. And now, never mind what I have been: don’t trouble\nyour head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we\nare.”\n\n“Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House.”\n\n“And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?”\n\n“Nay; he doesn’t live here: he is only staying a while. When he is at\nhome, he is in his own parish at Morton.”\n\n“That village a few miles off?\n\n“Aye.”\n\n“And what is he?”\n\n“He is a parson.”\n\nI remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I\nhad asked to see the clergyman. “This, then, was his father’s\nresidence?”\n\n“Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and\ngurt (great) grandfather afore him.”\n\n“The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?”\n\n“Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name.”\n\n“And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Their father is dead?”\n\n“Dead three weeks sin’ of a stroke.”\n\n“They have no mother?”\n\n“The mistress has been dead this mony a year.”\n\n“Have you lived with the family long?”\n\n“I’ve lived here thirty year. I nursed them all three.”\n\n“That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant. I will\nsay so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a\nbeggar.”\n\nShe again regarded me with a surprised stare. “I believe,” she said, “I\nwas quite mista’en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats\ngoes about, you mun forgie me.”\n\n“And though,” I continued, rather severely, “you wished to turn me from\nthe door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog.”\n\n“Well, it was hard: but what can a body do? I thought more o’ th’\nchilder nor of mysel: poor things! They’ve like nobody to tak’ care on\n’em but me. I’m like to look sharpish.”\n\nI maintained a grave silence for some minutes.\n\n“You munnut think too hardly of me,” she again remarked.\n\n“But I do think hardly of you,” I said; “and I’ll tell you why—not so\nmuch because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an\nimpostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I\nhad no ‘brass’ and no house. Some of the best people that ever lived\nhave been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought\nnot to consider poverty a crime.”\n\n“No more I ought,” said she: “Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I\nwor wrang—but I’ve clear a different notion on you now to what I had.\nYou look a raight down dacent little crater.”\n\n“That will do—I forgive you now. Shake hands.”\n\nShe put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile\nillumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.\n\nHannah was evidently fond of talking. While I picked the fruit, and she\nmade the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details\nabout her deceased master and mistress, and “the childer,” as she\ncalled the young people.\n\nOld Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and\nof as ancient a family as could be found. Marsh End had belonged to the\nRivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, “aboon two\nhundred year old—for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to\ncompare wi’ Mr. Oliver’s grand hall down i’ Morton Vale. But she could\nremember Bill Oliver’s father a journeyman needlemaker; and th’ Rivers\nwor gentry i’ th’ owd days o’ th’ Henrys, as onybody might see by\nlooking into th’ registers i’ Morton Church vestry.” Still, she\nallowed, “the owd maister was like other folk—naught mich out o’ t’\ncommon way: stark mad o’ shooting, and farming, and sich like.” The\nmistress was different. She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and\nthe “bairns” had taken after her. There was nothing like them in these\nparts, nor ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost\nfrom the time they could speak; and they had always been “of a mak’ of\ntheir own.” Mr. St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a\nparson; and the girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places\nas governesses: for they had told her their father had some years ago\nlost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt;\nand as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they must\nprovide for themselves. They had lived very little at home for a long\nwhile, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their\nfather’s death; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton, and all\nthese moors and hills about. They had been in London, and many other\ngrand towns; but they always said there was no place like home; and\nthen they were so agreeable with each other—never fell out nor\n“threaped.” She did not know where there was such a family for being\nunited.\n\nHaving finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two\nladies and their brother were now.\n\n“Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour\nto tea.”\n\nThey returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by\nthe kitchen door. Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed\nthrough; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and\ncalmly expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be\nable to come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.\n\n“You should have waited for my leave to descend,” she said. “You still\nlook very pale—and so thin! Poor child!—poor girl!”\n\nDiana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove. She\npossessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter. Her whole face\nseemed to me full of charm. Mary’s countenance was equally\nintelligent—her features equally pretty; but her expression was more\nreserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant. Diana looked\nand spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently. It was\nmy nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like\nhers, and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to\nan active will.\n\n“And what business have you here?” she continued. “It is not your\nplace. Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like\nto be free, even to license—but you are a visitor, and must go into the\nparlour.”\n\n“I am very well here.”\n\n“Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour.”\n\n“Besides, the fire is too hot for you,” interposed Mary.\n\n“To be sure,” added her sister. “Come, you must be obedient.” And still\nholding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.\n\n“Sit there,” she said, placing me on the sofa, “while we take our\nthings off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise\nin our little moorland home—to prepare our own meals when we are so\ninclined, or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing.”\n\nShe closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat\nopposite, a book or newspaper in his hand. I examined first, the\nparlour, and then its occupant.\n\nThe parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet\ncomfortable, because clean and neat. The old-fashioned chairs were very\nbright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass. A few\nstrange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated\nthe stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and\nan ancient set of china. There was no superfluous ornament in the\nroom—not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a\nlady’s desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:\neverything—including the carpet and curtains—looked at once well worn\nand well saved.\n\nMr. St. John—sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the\nwalls, keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips\nmutely sealed—was easy enough to examine. Had he been a statue instead\nof a man, he could not have been easier. He was young—perhaps from\ntwenty-eight to thirty—tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was\nlike a Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic\nnose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin. It is seldom, indeed, an\nEnglish face comes so near the antique models as did his. He might well\nbe a little shocked at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being\nso harmonious. His eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his\nhigh forehead, colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by\ncareless locks of fair hair.\n\nThis is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader? Yet he whom it\ndescribes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,\nan impressible, or even of a placid nature. Quiescent as he now sat,\nthere was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to\nmy perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or\neager. He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one\nglance, till his sisters returned. Diana, as she passed in and out, in\nthe course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top\nof the oven.\n\n“Eat that now,” she said: “you must be hungry. Hannah says you have had\nnothing but some gruel since breakfast.”\n\nI did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen. Mr. Rivers\nnow closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat,\nfixed his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me. There was an\nunceremonious directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his\ngaze now, which told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto\nkept it averted from the stranger.\n\n“You are very hungry,” he said.\n\n“I am, sir.” It is my way—it always was my way, by instinct—ever to\nmeet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.\n\n“It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the\nlast three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the\ncravings of your appetite at first. Now you may eat, though still not\nimmoderately.”\n\n“I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir,” was my very\nclumsily-contrived, unpolished answer.\n\n“No,” he said coolly: “when you have indicated to us the residence of\nyour friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home.”\n\n“That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being\nabsolutely without home and friends.”\n\nThe three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no\nsuspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity. I speak\nparticularly of the young ladies. St. John’s eyes, though clear enough\nin a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom. He\nseemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people’s\nthoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of\nkeenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than\nto encourage.\n\n“Do you mean to say,” he asked, “that you are completely isolated from\nevery connection?”\n\n“I do. Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess\nto admittance under any roof in England.”\n\n“A most singular position at your age!”\n\nHere I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the\ntable before me. I wondered what he sought there: his words soon\nexplained the quest.\n\n“You have never been married? You are a spinster?”\n\nDiana laughed. “Why, she can’t be above seventeen or eighteen years\nold, St. John,” said she.\n\n“I am near nineteen: but I am not married. No.”\n\nI felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating\nrecollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage. They all saw\nthe embarrassment and the emotion. Diana and Mary relieved me by\nturning their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the\ncolder and sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had\nexcited forced out tears as well as colour.\n\n“Where did you last reside?” he now asked.\n\n“You are too inquisitive, St. John,” murmured Mary in a low voice; but\nhe leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and\npiercing look.\n\n“The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is\nmy secret,” I replied concisely.\n\n“Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both\nfrom St. John and every other questioner,” remarked Diana.\n\n“Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you,”\nhe said. “And you need help, do you not?”\n\n“I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist\nwill put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the\nremuneration for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries\nof life.”\n\n“I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid\nyou to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest. First, then, tell\nme what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do.”\n\nI had now swallowed my tea. I was mightily refreshed by the beverage;\nas much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung\nnerves, and enabled me to address this penetrating young judge\nsteadily.\n\n“Mr. Rivers,” I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked\nat me, openly and without diffidence, “you and your sisters have done\nme a great service—the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have\nrescued me, by your noble hospitality, from death. This benefit\nconferred gives you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to\na certain extent, on my confidence. I will tell you as much of the\nhistory of the wanderer you have harboured, as I can tell without\ncompromising my own peace of mind—my own security, moral and physical,\nand that of others.\n\n“I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman. My parents died before I\ncould know them. I was brought up a dependent; educated in a charitable\ninstitution. I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where\nI passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher—Lowood Orphan\nAsylum, ——shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?—the Rev. Robert\nBrocklehurst is the treasurer.”\n\n“I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school.”\n\n“I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess. I\nobtained a good situation, and was happy. This place I was obliged to\nleave four days before I came here. The reason of my departure I cannot\nand ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would\nsound incredible. No blame attached to me: I am as free from\nculpability as any one of you three. Miserable I am, and must be for a\ntime; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a\nparadise was of a strange and direful nature. I observed but two points\nin planning my departure—speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to\nleave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in\nmy hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that\nbrought me to Whitcross. To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite\ndestitute. I slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two\ndays without crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did\nI taste food; and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and\ndespair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to\nperish of want at your door, and took me under the shelter of your\nroof. I know all your sisters have done for me since—for I have not\nbeen insensible during my seeming torpor—and I owe to their\nspontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your\nevangelical charity.”\n\n“Don’t make her talk any more now, St. John,” said Diana, as I paused;\n“she is evidently not yet fit for excitement. Come to the sofa and sit\ndown now, Miss Elliott.”\n\nI gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had\nforgotten my new name. Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape,\nnoticed it at once.\n\n“You said your name was Jane Elliott?” he observed.\n\n“I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be\ncalled at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it\nsounds strange to me.”\n\n“Your real name you will not give?”\n\n“No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would\nlead to it, I avoid.”\n\n“You are quite right, I am sure,” said Diana. “Now do, brother, let her\nbe at peace a while.”\n\nBut when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as\nimperturbably and with as much acumen as ever.\n\n“You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality—you would\nwish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters’ compassion,\nand, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the\ndistinction drawn, nor do I resent it—it is just): you desire to be\nindependent of us?”\n\n“I do: I have already said so. Show me how to work, or how to seek\nwork: that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the\nmeanest cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another\nessay of the horrors of homeless destitution.”\n\n“Indeed you _shall_ stay here,” said Diana, putting her white hand on\nmy head. “You _shall_,” repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative\nsincerity which seemed natural to her.\n\n“My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you,” said Mr. St.\nJohn, “as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a\nhalf-frozen bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their\ncasement. _I_ feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping\nyourself, and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is\nnarrow. I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be\nof the humblest sort. And if you are inclined to despise the day of\nsmall things, seek some more efficient succour than such as I can\noffer.”\n\n“She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she\n_can_ do,” answered Diana for me; “and you know, St. John, she has no\nchoice of helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as\nyou.”\n\n“I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a\nservant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better,” I answered.\n\n“Right,” said Mr. St. John, quite coolly. “If such is your spirit, I\npromise to aid you, in my own time and way.”\n\nHe now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea. I\nsoon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my\npresent strength would permit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nThe more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.\nIn a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all\nday, and walk out sometimes. I could join with Diana and Mary in all\ntheir occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid\nthem when and where they would allow me. There was a reviving pleasure\nin this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time—the\npleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and\nprinciples.\n\nI liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted\nme; what they approved, I reverenced. They loved their sequestered\nhome. I, too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof,\nits latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged\nfirs—all grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden,\ndark with yew and holly—and where no flowers but of the hardiest\nspecies would bloom—found a charm both potent and permanent. They clung\nto the purple moors behind and around their dwelling—to the hollow vale\ninto which the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended,\nand which wound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the\nwildest little pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath,\nor gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little\nmossy-faced lambs:—they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect\nenthusiasm of attachment. I could comprehend the feeling, and share\nboth its strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality. I\nfelt the consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline\nof swell and sweep—on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell\nby moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken,\nand mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were\nto them—so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast\nand the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of\nsunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for\nme, in these regions, the same attraction as for them—wound round my\nfaculties the same spell that entranced theirs.\n\nIndoors we agreed equally well. They were both more accomplished and\nbetter read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of\nknowledge they had trodden before me. I devoured the books they lent\nme: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening\nwhat I had perused during the day. Thought fitted thought; opinion met\nopinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.\n\nIf in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.\nPhysically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous. In\nher animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of\nflow, such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension. I\ncould talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of\nvivacity and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana’s\nfeet, to rest my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and\nMary, while they sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but\ntouched. Diana offered to teach me German. I liked to learn of her: I\nsaw the part of instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar\npleased and suited me no less. Our natures dovetailed: mutual\naffection—of the strongest kind—was the result. They discovered I could\ndraw: their pencils and colour-boxes were immediately at my service. My\nskill, greater in this one point than theirs, surprised and charmed\nthem. Mary would sit and watch me by the hour together: then she would\ntake lessons; and a docile, intelligent, assiduous pupil she made. Thus\noccupied, and mutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks\nlike days.\n\nAs to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and\nrapidly between me and his sisters did not extend to him. One reason of\nthe distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively\nseldom at home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to\nvisiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his\nparish.\n\nNo weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or\nfair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his\nhat, and, followed by his father’s old pointer, Carlo, go out on his\nmission of love or duty—I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.\nSometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would\nexpostulate. He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than\ncheerful—\n\n“And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from\nthese easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I\npropose to myself?”\n\nDiana and Mary’s general answer to this question was a sigh, and some\nminutes of apparently mournful meditation.\n\nBut besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to\nfriendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even\nof a brooding nature. Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in\nhis life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental\nserenity, that inward content, which should be the reward of every\nsincere Christian and practical philanthropist. Often, of an evening,\nwhen he sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would\ncease reading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver\nhimself up to I know not what course of thought; but that it was\nperturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and\nchangeful dilation of his eye.\n\nI think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight\nit was to his sisters. He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a\nstrong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection\nfor the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was\nmore of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the\nsentiment was manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for\nthe sake of their soothing silence—never seek out or dwell upon the\nthousand peaceful delights they could yield.\n\nIncommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an\nopportunity of gauging his mind. I first got an idea of its calibre\nwhen I heard him preach in his own church at Morton. I wish I could\ndescribe that sermon: but it is past my power. I cannot even render\nfaithfully the effect it produced on me.\n\nIt began calm—and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went,\nit was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal\nbreathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous\nlanguage. This grew to force—compressed, condensed, controlled. The\nheart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher:\nneither were softened. Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an\nabsence of consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic\ndoctrines—election, predestination, reprobation—were frequent; and each\nreference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.\nWhen he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened\nby his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed\nto me—I know not whether equally so to others—that the eloquence to\nwhich I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid\ndregs of disappointment—where moved troubling impulses of insatiate\nyearnings and disquieting aspirations. I was sure St. John\nRivers—pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he was—had not yet found\nthat peace of God which passeth all understanding: he had no more found\nit, I thought, than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my\nbroken idol and lost elysium—regrets to which I have latterly avoided\nreferring, but which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.\n\nMeantime a month was gone. Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor\nHouse, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited\nthem, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city,\nwhere each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty\nmembers they were regarded only as humble dependents, and who neither\nknew nor sought out their innate excellences, and appreciated only\ntheir acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their\ncook or the taste of their waiting-woman. Mr. St. John had said nothing\nto me yet about the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it\nbecame urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind. One morning,\nbeing left alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to\napproach the window-recess—which his table, chair, and desk consecrated\nas a kind of study—and I was going to speak, though not very well\nknowing in what words to frame my inquiry—for it is at all times\ndifficult to break the ice of reserve glassing over such natures as\nhis—when he saved me the trouble by being the first to commence a\ndialogue.\n\nLooking up as I drew near—“You have a question to ask of me?” he said.\n\n“Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer\nmyself to undertake?”\n\n“I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you\nseemed both useful and happy here—as my sisters had evidently become\nattached to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure—I deemed\nit inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their\napproaching departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary.”\n\n“And they will go in three days now?” I said.\n\n“Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton:\nHannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up.”\n\nI waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first\nbroached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection:\nhis look denoted abstraction from me and my business. I was obliged to\nrecall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious\ninterest to me.\n\n“What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers? I hope this delay\nwill not have increased the difficulty of securing it.”\n\n“Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give,\nand you to accept.”\n\nHe again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue. I grew\nimpatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance\nfastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as\nwords could have done, and with less trouble.\n\n“You need be in no hurry to hear,” he said: “let me frankly tell you, I\nhave nothing eligible or profitable to suggest. Before I explain,\nrecall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you,\nit must be as the blind man would help the lame. I am poor; for I find\nthat, when I have paid my father’s debts, all the patrimony remaining\nto me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind,\nand the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in\nfront. I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole\ndescendants of the race, two earn the dependent’s crust among\nstrangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his native\ncountry—not only for life, but in death. Yes, and deems, and is bound\nto deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day\nwhen the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his\nshoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest\nmembers he is one, shall give the word, ‘Rise, follow Me!’”\n\nSt. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,\ndeep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of\nglance. He resumed—\n\n“And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service\nof poverty and obscurity. _You_ may even think it degrading—for I see\nnow your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes\nlean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the\neducated; but _I_ consider that no service degrades which can better\nour race. I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the\nChristian labourer’s task of tillage is appointed him—the scantier the\nmeed his toil brings—the higher the honour. His, under such\ncircumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of\nthe Gospel were the Apostles—their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer,\nHimself.”\n\n“Well?” I said, as he again paused—“proceed.”\n\nHe looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to\nread my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.\nThe conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his\nsucceeding observations.\n\n“I believe you will accept the post I offer you,” said he, “and hold it\nfor a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently\nkeep the narrow and narrowing—the tranquil, hidden office of English\ncountry incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to\nrepose as that in mine, though of a different kind.”\n\n“Do explain,” I urged, when he halted once more.\n\n“I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,—how trivial—how\ncramping. I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,\nand that I am my own master. I shall leave the place probably in the\ncourse of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to\nthe utmost for its improvement. Morton, when I came to it two years\nago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every\nhope of progress. I established one for boys: I mean now to open a\nsecond school for girls. I have hired a building for the purpose, with\na cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress’s house. Her\nsalary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished,\nvery simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver;\nthe only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish—Mr. Oliver, the\nproprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley. The same\nlady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the\nworkhouse, on condition that she shall aid the mistress in such menial\noffices connected with her own house and the school as her occupation\nof teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in person. Will\nyou be this mistress?”\n\nHe put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an\nindignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing\nall my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell\nin what light the lot would appear to me. In truth it was humble—but\nthen it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding—but\nthen, compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was\nindependent; and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul\nlike iron: it was not ignoble—not unworthy—not mentally degrading, I\nmade my decision.\n\n“I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my\nheart.”\n\n“But you comprehend me?” he said. “It is a village school: your\nscholars will be only poor girls—cottagers’ children—at the best,\nfarmers’ daughters. Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will\nbe all you will have to teach. What will you do with your\naccomplishments? What, with the largest portion of your\nmind—sentiments—tastes?”\n\n“Save them till they are wanted. They will keep.”\n\n“You know what you undertake, then?”\n\n“I do.”\n\nHe now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased\nand deeply gratified.\n\n“And when will you commence the exercise of your function?”\n\n“I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like,\nnext week.”\n\n“Very well: so be it.”\n\nHe rose and walked through the room. Standing still, he again looked at\nme. He shook his head.\n\n“What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?” I asked.\n\n“You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!”\n\n“Why? What is your reason for saying so?”\n\n“I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises\nthe maintenance of an even tenor in life.”\n\n“I am not ambitious.”\n\nHe started at the word “ambitious.” He repeated, “No. What made you\nthink of ambition? Who is ambitious? I know I am: but how did you find\nit out?”\n\n“I was speaking of myself.”\n\n“Well, if you are not ambitious, you are—” He paused.\n\n“What?”\n\n“I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have\nmisunderstood the word, and been displeased. I mean, that human\naffections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you. I am sure\nyou cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to\ndevote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of\nstimulus: any more than I can be content,” he added, with emphasis, “to\nlive here buried in morass, pent in with mountains—my nature, that God\ngave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed—made\nuseless. You hear now how I contradict myself. I, who preached\ncontentment with a humble lot, and justified the vocation even of\nhewers of wood and drawers of water in God’s service—I, His ordained\nminister, almost rave in my restlessness. Well, propensities and\nprinciples must be reconciled by some means.”\n\nHe left the room. In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in\nthe whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.\n\nDiana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached\nfor leaving their brother and their home. They both tried to appear as\nusual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could\nnot be entirely conquered or concealed. Diana intimated that this would\nbe a different parting from any they had ever yet known. It would\nprobably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it\nmight be a parting for life.\n\n“He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves,” she said: “natural\naffection and feelings more potent still. St. John looks quiet, Jane;\nbut he hides a fever in his vitals. You would think him gentle, yet in\nsome things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my\nconscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe\ndecision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it. It is\nright, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!” And the tears gushed\nto her fine eyes. Mary bent her head low over her work.\n\n“We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,”\nshe murmured.\n\nAt that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by\nfate purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that “misfortunes never\ncome singly,” and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip\nbetween the cup and the lip. St. John passed the window reading a\nletter. He entered.\n\n“Our uncle John is dead,” said he.\n\nBoth the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings\nappeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.\n\n“Dead?” repeated Diana.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nShe riveted a searching gaze on her brother’s face. “And what then?”\nshe demanded, in a low voice.\n\n“What then, Die?” he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of\nfeature. “What then? Why—nothing. Read.”\n\nHe threw the letter into her lap. She glanced over it, and handed it to\nMary. Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother. All\nthree looked at each other, and all three smiled—a dreary, pensive\nsmile enough.\n\n“Amen! We can yet live,” said Diana at last.\n\n“At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before,” remarked\nMary.\n\n“Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might\nhave been_,” said Mr. Rivers, “and contrasts it somewhat too vividly\nwith what _is_.”\n\nHe folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.\n\nFor some minutes no one spoke. Diana then turned to me.\n\n“Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries,” she said, “and think\nus hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a\nrelation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him. He was\nmy mother’s brother. My father and he quarrelled long ago. It was by\nhis advice that my father risked most of his property in the\nspeculation that ruined him. Mutual recrimination passed between them:\nthey parted in anger, and were never reconciled. My uncle engaged\nafterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a\nfortune of twenty thousand pounds. He was never married, and had no\nnear kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely\nrelated than we. My father always cherished the idea that he would\natone for his error by leaving his possessions to us; that letter\ninforms us that he has bequeathed every penny to the other relation,\nwith the exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John,\nDiana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning rings. He\nhad a right, of course, to do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp\nis cast on the spirits by the receipt of such news. Mary and I would\nhave esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds each; and to St.\nJohn such a sum would have been valuable, for the good it would have\nenabled him to do.”\n\nThis explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further\nreference made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters. The next day\nI left Marsh End for Morton. The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it\nfor distant B——. In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the\nparsonage: and so the old grange was abandoned.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nMy home, then, when I at last find a home,—is a cottage; a little room\nwith whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted\nchairs and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and\ndishes, and a set of tea-things in delf. Above, a chamber of the same\ndimensions as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers;\nsmall, yet too large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the\nkindness of my gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a\nmodest stock of such things as are necessary.\n\nIt is evening. I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little\norphan who serves me as a handmaid. I am sitting alone on the hearth.\nThis morning, the village school opened. I had twenty scholars. But\nthree of the number can read: none write or cipher. Several knit, and a\nfew sew a little. They speak with the broadest accent of the district.\nAt present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other’s\nlanguage. Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as\nignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a\ndisposition that pleases me. I must not forget that these coarsely-clad\nlittle peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of\ngentlest genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence,\nrefinement, intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their\nhearts as in those of the best-born. My duty will be to develop these\ngerms: surely I shall find some happiness in discharging that office.\nMuch enjoyment I do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it\nwill, doubtless, if I regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought,\nyield me enough to live on from day to day.\n\nWas I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in\nyonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon? Not to\ndeceive myself, I must reply—No: I felt desolate to a degree. I\nfelt—yes, idiot that I am—I felt degraded. I doubted I had taken a step\nwhich sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence. I\nwas weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of\nall I heard and saw round me. But let me not hate and despise myself\ntoo much for these feelings; I know them to be wrong—that is a great\nstep gained; I shall strive to overcome them. To-morrow, I trust, I\nshall get the better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps,\nthey will be quite subdued. In a few months, it is possible, the\nhappiness of seeing progress, and a change for the better in my\nscholars may substitute gratification for disgust.\n\nMeantime, let me ask myself one question—Which is better?—To have\nsurrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful\neffort—no struggle;—but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen\nasleep on the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst\nthe luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France,\nMr. Rochester’s mistress; delirious with his love half my time—for he\nwould—oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while. He _did_ love\nme—no one will ever love me so again. I shall never more know the sweet\nhomage given to beauty, youth, and grace—for never to any one else\nshall I seem to possess these charms. He was fond and proud of me—it is\nwhat no man besides will ever be.—But where am I wandering, and what am\nI saying, and above all, feeling? Whether is it better, I ask, to be a\nslave in a fool’s paradise at Marseilles—fevered with delusive bliss\none hour—suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the\nnext—or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy\nmountain nook in the healthy heart of England?\n\nYes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law,\nand scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment. God\ndirected me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the\nguidance!\n\nHaving brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my\ndoor, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet\nfields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a\nmile from the village. The birds were singing their last strains—\n\n“The air was mild, the dew was balm.”\n\n\nWhile I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find\nmyself ere long weeping—and why? For the doom which had reft me from\nadhesion to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate\ngrief and fatal fury—consequences of my departure—which might now,\nperhaps, be dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope\nof ultimate restoration thither. At this thought, I turned my face\naside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton—I say\n_lonely_, for in that bend of it visible to me there was no building\napparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and,\nquite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr.\nOliver and his daughter lived. I hid my eyes, and leant my head against\nthe stone frame of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket\nwhich shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it made me look up.\nA dog—old Carlo, Mr. Rivers’ pointer, as I saw in a moment—was pushing\nthe gate with his nose, and St. John himself leant upon it with folded\narms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on\nme. I asked him to come in.\n\n“No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters\nleft for you. I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper.”\n\nI approached to take it: a welcome gift it was. He examined my face, I\nthought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were\ndoubtless very visible upon it.\n\n“Have you found your first day’s work harder than you expected?” he\nasked.\n\n“Oh, no! On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my\nscholars very well.”\n\n“But perhaps your accommodations—your cottage—your furniture—have\ndisappointed your expectations? They are, in truth, scanty enough;\nbut—” I interrupted—\n\n“My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and\ncommodious. All I see has made me thankful, not despondent. I am not\nabsolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a\ncarpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had\nnothing—I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance,\na home, a business. I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of\nmy friends; the bounty of my lot. I do not repine.”\n\n“But you feel solitude an oppression? The little house there behind you\nis dark and empty.”\n\n“I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less\nto grow impatient under one of loneliness.”\n\n“Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your\ngood sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the\nvacillating fears of Lot’s wife. What you had left before I saw you, of\ncourse I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every\ntemptation which would incline you to look back: pursue your present\ncareer steadily, for some months at least.”\n\n“It is what I mean to do,” I answered. St. John continued—\n\n“It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the\nbent of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience. God\nhas given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when\nour energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get—when our will\nstrains after a path we may not follow—we need neither starve from\ninanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another\nnourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to\ntaste—and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road\nas direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if\nrougher than it.\n\n“A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had\nmade a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me\nto death. I burnt for the more active life of the world—for the more\nexciting toils of a literary career—for the destiny of an artist,\nauthor, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart\nof a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown,\na luster after power, beat under my curate’s surplice. I considered; my\nlife was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die. After a season\nof darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped\nexistence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds—my powers\nheard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread\ntheir wings, and mount beyond ken. God had an errand for me; to bear\nwhich afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and\neloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,\nwere all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.\n\n“A missionary I resolved to be. From that moment my state of mind\nchanged; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving\nnothing of bondage but its galling soreness—which time only can heal.\nMy father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I\nhave not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a\nsuccessor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings\nbroken through or cut asunder—a last conflict with human weakness, in\nwhich I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_\novercome—and I leave Europe for the East.”\n\nHe said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking,\nwhen he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at\nwhich I looked too. Both he and I had our backs towards the path\nleading up the field to the wicket. We had heard no step on that\ngrass-grown track; the water running in the vale was the one lulling\nsound of the hour and scene; we might well then start when a gay voice,\nsweet as a silver bell, exclaimed—\n\n“Good evening, Mr. Rivers. And good evening, old Carlo. Your dog is\nquicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears\nand wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have\nyour back towards me now.”\n\nIt was true. Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those\nmusical accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head,\nhe stood yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in\nwhich the speaker had surprised him—his arm resting on the gate, his\nface directed towards the west. He turned at last, with measured\ndeliberation. A vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.\nThere appeared, within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white—a\nyouthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after\nbending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and threw back a long\nveil, there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty. Perfect\nbeauty is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as\nsweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure\nhues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies\ngenerated and screened, justified, in this instance, the term. No charm\nwas wanting, no defect was perceptible; the young girl had regular and\ndelicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely\npictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which\nencircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled brow\nwhich gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such\nrepose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh,\nand smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the\neven and gleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the\nornament of rich, plenteous tresses—all advantages, in short, which,\ncombined, realise the ideal of beauty, were fully hers. I wondered, as\nI looked at this fair creature: I admired her with my whole heart.\nNature had surely formed her in a partial mood; and, forgetting her\nusual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed this, her darling,\nwith a grand-dame’s bounty.\n\nWhat did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel? I naturally asked\nmyself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as\nnaturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance. He\nhad already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a\nhumble tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.\n\n“A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,” he said, as he\ncrushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.\n\n“Oh, I only came home from S——” (she mentioned the name of a large town\nsome twenty miles distant) “this afternoon. Papa told me you had opened\nyour school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my\nbonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?”\npointing to me.\n\n“It is,” said St. John.\n\n“Do you think you shall like Morton?” she asked of me, with a direct\nand naïve simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.\n\n“I hope I shall. I have many inducements to do so.”\n\n“Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?”\n\n“Quite.”\n\n“Do you like your house?”\n\n“Very much.”\n\n“Have I furnished it nicely?”\n\n“Very nicely, indeed.”\n\n“And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?”\n\n“You have indeed. She is teachable and handy.” (This then, I thought,\nis Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of\nfortune, as well as in those of nature! What happy combination of the\nplanets presided over her birth, I wonder?)\n\n“I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes,” she added. “It will\nbe a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change. Mr.\nRivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S——. Last night, or\nrather this morning, I was dancing till two o’clock. The ——th regiment\nare stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most\nagreeable men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and\nscissor merchants to shame.”\n\nIt seemed to me that Mr. St. John’s under lip protruded, and his upper\nlip curled a moment. His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,\nand the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the\nlaughing girl gave him this information. He lifted his gaze, too, from\nthe daisies, and turned it on her. An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning\ngaze it was. She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well\nbecame her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.\n\nAs he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo. “Poor\nCarlo loves me,” said she. “_He_ is not stern and distant to his\nfriends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent.”\n\nAs she patted the dog’s head, bending with native grace before his\nyoung and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master’s face. I\nsaw his solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless\nemotion. Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a\nman as she for a woman. His chest heaved once, as if his large heart,\nweary of despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and\nmade a vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty. But he curbed it,\nI think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed. He responded\nneither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.\n\n“Papa says you never come to see us now,” continued Miss Oliver,\nlooking up. “You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall. He is alone this\nevening, and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?”\n\n“It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,” answered St.\nJohn.\n\n“Not a seasonable hour! But I declare it is. It is just the hour when\npapa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no\nbusiness to occupy him. Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come. Why are you so very\nshy, and so very sombre?” She filled up the hiatus his silence left by\na reply of her own.\n\n“I forgot!” she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if\nshocked at herself. “I am so giddy and thoughtless! _Do_ excuse me. It\nhad slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for\njoining in my chatter. Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is\nshut up, and you are so lonely. I am sure I pity you. Do come and see\npapa.”\n\n“Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night.”\n\nMr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the\neffort it cost him thus to refuse.\n\n“Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay\nany longer: the dew begins to fall. Good evening!”\n\nShe held out her hand. He just touched it. “Good evening!” he repeated,\nin a voice low and hollow as an echo. She turned, but in a moment\nreturned.\n\n“Are you well?” she asked. Well might she put the question: his face\nwas blanched as her gown.\n\n“Quite well,” he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate. She\nwent one way; he another. She turned twice to gaze after him as she\ntripped fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across,\nnever turned at all.\n\nThis spectacle of another’s suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts\nfrom exclusive meditation on my own. Diana Rivers had designated her\nbrother “inexorable as death.” She had not exaggerated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nI continued the labours of the village-school as actively and\nfaithfully as I could. It was truly hard work at first. Some time\nelapsed before, with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and\ntheir nature. Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed\nto me hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon\nfound I was mistaken. There was a difference amongst them as amongst\nthe educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference\nrapidly developed itself. Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,\nand ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping\nrustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough. Many showed themselves\nobliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few\nexamples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of\nexcellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration. These\nsoon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons\nneat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly\nmanners. The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even\nsurprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I\nbegan personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me. I\nhad amongst my scholars several farmers’ daughters: young women grown,\nalmost. These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught\nthe elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of\nneedlework. I found estimable characters amongst them—characters\ndesirous of information and disposed for improvement—with whom I passed\nmany a pleasant evening hour in their own homes. Their parents then\n(the farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions. There was an\nenjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a\nconsideration—a scrupulous regard to their feelings—to which they were\nnot, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and\nbenefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it\nmade them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.\n\nI felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood. Whenever I went out,\nI heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with\nfriendly smiles. To live amidst general regard, though it be but the\nregard of working people, is like “sitting in sunshine, calm and\nsweet;” serene inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray. At this\nperiod of my life, my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than\nsank with dejection: and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of\nthis calm, this useful existence—after a day passed in honourable\nexertion amongst my scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading\ncontentedly alone—I used to rush into strange dreams at night: dreams\nmany-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the\nstormy—dreams where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure,\nwith agitating risk and romantic chance, I still again and again met\nMr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and then the sense of\nbeing in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye, touching his\nhand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him—the hope of passing a\nlifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first force and\nfire. Then I awoke. Then I recalled where I was, and how situated. Then\nI rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering; and then the\nstill, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and heard the\nburst of passion. By nine o’clock the next morning I was punctually\nopening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties\nof the day.\n\nRosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me. Her call at the\nschool was generally made in the course of her morning ride. She would\ncanter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery\nservant. Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple\nhabit, with her Amazon’s cap of black velvet placed gracefully above\nthe long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can\nscarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic\nbuilding, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children.\nShe generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving\nhis daily catechising lesson. Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the\nvisitress pierce the young pastor’s heart. A sort of instinct seemed to\nwarn him of her entrance, even when he did not see it; and when he was\nlooking quite away from the door, if she appeared at it, his cheek\nwould glow, and his marble-seeming features, though they refused to\nrelax, changed indescribably, and in their very quiescence became\nexpressive of a repressed fervour, stronger than working muscle or\ndarting glance could indicate.\n\nOf course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could\nnot, conceal it from her. In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she\nwent up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly\nin his face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn. He seemed to say,\nwith his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, “I\nlove you, and I know you prefer me. It is not despair of success that\nkeeps me dumb. If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.\nBut that heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged\nround it. It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed.”\n\nAnd then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud\nwould soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily\nfrom his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so\nheroic and so martyr-like. St. John, no doubt, would have given the\nworld to follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he\nwould not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of\nher love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise. Besides, he could not\nbind all that he had in his nature—the rover, the aspirant, the poet,\nthe priest—in the limits of a single passion. He could not—he would\nnot—renounce his wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the\npeace of Vale Hall. I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once,\ndespite his reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.\n\nMiss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage. I\nhad learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:\nshe was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly\nselfish. She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely\nspoilt. She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,\nwhen every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),\nbut not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;\ningenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she\nwas very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex\nlike me; but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly\nimpressive. A very different sort of mind was hers from that, for\ninstance, of the sisters of St. John. Still, I liked her almost as I\nliked my pupil Adèle; except that, for a child whom we have watched\nover and taught, a closer affection is engendered than we can give an\nequally attractive adult acquaintance.\n\nShe had taken an amiable caprice to me. She said I was like Mr. Rivers,\nonly, certainly, she allowed, “not one-tenth so handsome, though I was\na nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel.” I was, however,\ngood, clever, composed, and firm, like him. I was a _lusus naturæ_, she\naffirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous\nhistory, if known, would make a delightful romance.\n\nOne evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless\nyet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and\nthe table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French\nbooks, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then\nmy drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a\npretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views\nfrom nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.\nShe was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with\ndelight.\n\n“Had I done these pictures? Did I know French and German? What a\nlove—what a miracle I was! I drew better than her master in the first\nschool in S——. Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?”\n\n“With pleasure,” I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at\nthe idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model. She had then\non a dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only\nornament was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with\nall the wild grace of natural curls. I took a sheet of fine card-board,\nand drew a careful outline. I promised myself the pleasure of colouring\nit; and, as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit\nanother day.\n\nShe made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself\naccompanied her next evening—a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and\ngrey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright\nflower near a hoary turret. He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud\npersonage; but he was very kind to me. The sketch of Rosamond’s\nportrait pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of\nit. He insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at\nVale Hall.\n\nI went. I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant\nevidences of wealth in the proprietor. Rosamond was full of glee and\npleasure all the time I stayed. Her father was affable; and when he\nentered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong\nterms his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he\nonly feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place,\nand would soon quit it for one more suitable.\n\n“Indeed,” cried Rosamond, “she is clever enough to be a governess in a\nhigh family, papa.”\n\nI thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in\nthe land. Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers—of the Rivers family—with\ngreat respect. He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood;\nthat the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once\nbelonged to them; that even now he considered the representative of\nthat house might, if he liked, make an alliance with the best. He\naccounted it a pity that so fine and talented a young man should have\nformed the design of going out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a\nvaluable life away. It appeared, then, that her father would throw no\nobstacle in the way of Rosamond’s union with St. John. Mr. Oliver\nevidently regarded the young clergyman’s good birth, old name, and\nsacred profession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.\n\nIt was the 5th of November, and a holiday. My little servant, after\nhelping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of\na penny for her aid. All about me was spotless and bright—scoured\nfloor, polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs. I had also made myself\nneat, and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.\n\nThe translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got\nmy palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier\noccupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver’s miniature. The head was\nfinished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery\nto shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips—a soft\ncurl here and there to the tresses—a deeper tinge to the shadow of the\nlash under the azured eyelid. I was absorbed in the execution of these\nnice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting\nSt. John Rivers.\n\n“I am come to see how you are spending your holiday,” he said. “Not, I\nhope, in thought? No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel\nlonely. You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up\nwonderfully so far. I have brought you a book for evening solace,” and\nhe laid on the table a new publication—a poem: one of those genuine\nproductions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those\ndays—the golden age of modern literature. Alas! the readers of our era\nare less favoured. But courage! I will not pause either to accuse or\nrepine. I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon\ngained power over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their\nexistence, their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.\nPowerful angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph,\nand feeble ones weep over their destruction. Poetry destroyed? Genius\nbanished? No! Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the\nthought. No; they not only live, but reign and redeem: and without\ntheir divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell—the hell\nof your own meanness.\n\nWhile I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of “Marmion” (for\n“Marmion” it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing. His tall\nfigure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing. I looked up at\nhim: he shunned my eye. I knew his thoughts well, and could read his\nheart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had\nthen temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination\nto do him some good, if I could.\n\n“With all his firmness and self-control,” thought I, “he tasks himself\ntoo far: locks every feeling and pang within—expresses, confesses,\nimparts nothing. I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about\nthis sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make\nhim talk.”\n\nI said first, “Take a chair, Mr. Rivers.” But he answered, as he always\ndid, that he could not stay. “Very well,” I responded, mentally, “stand\nif you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude\nis at least as bad for you as it is for me. I’ll try if I cannot\ndiscover the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in\nthat marble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of\nsympathy.”\n\n“Is this portrait like?” I asked bluntly.\n\n“Like! Like whom? I did not observe it closely.”\n\n“You did, Mr. Rivers.”\n\nHe almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me\nastonished. “Oh, that is nothing yet,” I muttered within. “I don’t mean\nto be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I’m prepared to go to\nconsiderable lengths.” I continued, “You observed it closely and\ndistinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again,” and I\nrose and placed it in his hand.\n\n“A well-executed picture,” he said; “very soft, clear colouring; very\ngraceful and correct drawing.”\n\n“Yes, yes; I know all that. But what of the resemblance? Who is it\nlike?”\n\nMastering some hesitation, he answered, “Miss Oliver, I presume.”\n\n“Of course. And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will\npromise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very\npicture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you. I\ndon’t wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would\ndeem worthless.”\n\nHe continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer\nhe held it, the more he seemed to covet it. “It is like!” he murmured;\n“the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.\nIt smiles!”\n\n“Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?\nTell me that. When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India,\nwould it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or\nwould the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and\ndistress?”\n\nHe now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,\ndisturbed: he again surveyed the picture.\n\n“That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be\njudicious or wise is another question.”\n\nSince I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that\nher father was not likely to oppose the match, I—less exalted in my\nviews than St. John—had been strongly disposed in my own heart to\nadvocate their union. It seemed to me that, should he become the\npossessor of Mr. Oliver’s large fortune, he might do as much good with\nit as if he went and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to\nwaste, under a tropical sun. With this persuasion I now answered—\n\n“As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were\nto take to yourself the original at once.”\n\nBy this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table\nbefore him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over\nit. I discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity. I\nsaw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed\nunapproachable—to hear it thus freely handled—was beginning to be felt\nby him as a new pleasure—an unhoped-for relief. Reserved people often\nreally need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more\nthan the expansive. The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and\nto “burst” with boldness and good-will into “the silent sea” of their\nsouls is often to confer on them the first of obligations.\n\n“She likes you, I am sure,” said I, as I stood behind his chair, “and\nher father respects you. Moreover, she is a sweet girl—rather\nthoughtless; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself\nand her. You ought to marry her.”\n\n“_Does_ she like me?” he asked.\n\n“Certainly; better than she likes any one else. She talks of you\ncontinually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so\noften.”\n\n“It is very pleasant to hear this,” he said—“very: go on for another\nquarter of an hour.” And he actually took out his watch and laid it\nupon the table to measure the time.\n\n“But where is the use of going on,” I asked, “when you are probably\npreparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to\nfetter your heart?”\n\n“Don’t imagine such hard things. Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am\ndoing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and\noverflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and\nwith such labour prepared—so assiduously sown with the seeds of good\nintentions, of self-denying plans. And now it is deluged with a\nnectarous flood—the young germs swamped—delicious poison cankering\nthem: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at\nVale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver’s feet: she is talking to me with\nher sweet voice—gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has\ncopied so well—smiling at me with these coral lips. She is mine—I am\nhers—this present life and passing world suffice to me. Hush! say\nnothing—my heart is full of delight—my senses are entranced—let the\ntime I marked pass in peace.”\n\nI humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood\nsilent. Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid\nthe picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.\n\n“Now,” said he, “that little space was given to delirium and delusion.\nI rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck\nvoluntarily under her yoke of flowers; I tasted her cup. The pillow was\nburning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste:\nher promises are hollow—her offers false: I see and know all this.”\n\nI gazed at him in wonder.\n\n“It is strange,” pursued he, “that while I love Rosamond Oliver so\nwildly—with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object\nof which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating—I experience\nat the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make\nme a good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should\ndiscover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months’\nrapture would succeed a lifetime of regret. This I know.”\n\n“Strange indeed!” I could not help ejaculating.\n\n“While something in me,” he went on, “is acutely sensible to her\ncharms, something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they\nare such that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to—co-operate\nin nothing I undertook. Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female\napostle? Rosamond a missionary’s wife? No!”\n\n“But you need not be a missionary. You might relinquish that scheme.”\n\n“Relinquish! What! my vocation? My great work? My foundation laid on\nearth for a mansion in heaven? My hopes of being numbered in the band\nwho have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their\nrace—of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance—of substituting\npeace for war—freedom for bondage—religion for superstition—the hope of\nheaven for the fear of hell? Must I relinquish that? It is dearer than\nthe blood in my veins. It is what I have to look forward to, and to\nlive for.”\n\nAfter a considerable pause, I said—“And Miss Oliver? Are her\ndisappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?”\n\n“Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than\na month, my image will be effaced from her heart. She will forget me;\nand will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I\nshould do.”\n\n“You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict. You are\nwasting away.”\n\n“No. If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet\nunsettled—my departure, continually procrastinated. Only this morning,\nI received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been\nso long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to\ncome yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six.”\n\n“You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the\nschoolroom.”\n\nAgain the surprised expression crossed his face. He had not imagined\nthat a woman would dare to speak so to a man. For me, I felt at home in\nthis sort of discourse. I could never rest in communication with\nstrong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had\npassed the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold\nof confidence, and won a place by their heart’s very hearthstone.\n\n“You _are_ original,” said he, “and not timid. There is something brave\nin your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to\nassure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions. You think them\nmore profound and potent than they are. You give me a larger allowance\nof sympathy than I have a just claim to. When I colour, and when I\nshake before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself. I scorn the weakness. I\nknow it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the\nconvulsion of the soul. _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in\nthe depths of a restless sea. Know me to be what I am—a cold hard man.”\n\nI smiled incredulously.\n\n“You have taken my confidence by storm,” he continued, “and now it is\nmuch at your service. I am simply, in my original state—stripped of\nthat blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human\ndeformity—a cold, hard, ambitious man. Natural affection only, of all\nthe sentiments, has permanent power over me. Reason, and not feeling,\nis my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do\nmore than others, insatiable. I honour endurance, perseverance,\nindustry, talent; because these are the means by which men achieve\ngreat ends and mount to lofty eminence. I watch your career with\ninterest, because I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly,\nenergetic woman: not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone\nthrough, or what you still suffer.”\n\n“You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher,” I said.\n\n“No. There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I\nbelieve; and I believe the Gospel. You missed your epithet. I am not a\npagan, but a Christian philosopher—a follower of the sect of Jesus. As\nHis disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines. I\nadvocate them: I am sworn to spread them. Won in youth to religion, she\nhas cultivated my original qualities thus:—From the minute germ,\nnatural affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree,\nphilanthropy. From the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has\nreared a due sense of the Divine justice. Of the ambition to win power\nand renown for my wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread\nmy Master’s kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the\ncross. So much has religion done for me; turning the original materials\nto the best account; pruning and training nature. But she could not\neradicate nature: nor will it be eradicated ‘till this mortal shall put\non immortality.’”\n\nHaving said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my\npalette. Once more he looked at the portrait.\n\n“She _is_ lovely,” he murmured. “She is well named the Rose of the\nWorld, indeed!”\n\n“And may I not paint one like it for you?”\n\n“_Cui bono_? No.”\n\nHe drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was\naccustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from\nbeing sullied. What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was\nimpossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye. He took it\nup with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,\ninexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that\nseemed to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and\ndress; for it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning. His lips parted,\nas if to speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.\n\n“What is the matter?” I asked.\n\n“Nothing in the world,” was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw\nhim dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin. It disappeared in\nhis glove; and, with one hasty nod and “good-afternoon,” he vanished.\n\n“Well!” I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, “that caps\nthe globe, however!”\n\nI, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few\ndingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil. I\npondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and\nbeing certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon\nforgot it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nWhen Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm\ncontinued all night. The next day a keen wind brought fresh and\nblinding falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost\nimpassable. I had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent\nthe snow from blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting\nnearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the\ntempest, I lit a candle, took down “Marmion,” and beginning—\n\n“Day set on Norham’s castled steep,\nAnd Tweed’s fair river broad and deep,\n    And Cheviot’s mountains lone;\nThe massive towers, the donjon keep,\nThe flanking walls that round them sweep,\n    In yellow lustre shone”—\n\n\nI soon forgot storm in music.\n\nI heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door. No; it was St.\nJohn Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen\nhurricane—the howling darkness—and stood before me: the cloak that\ncovered his tall figure all white as a glacier. I was almost in\nconsternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up\nvale that night.\n\n“Any ill news?” I demanded. “Has anything happened?”\n\n“No. How very easily alarmed you are!” he answered, removing his cloak\nand hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly\npushed the mat which his entrance had deranged. He stamped the snow\nfrom his boots.\n\n“I shall sully the purity of your floor,” said he, “but you must excuse\nme for once.” Then he approached the fire. “I have had hard work to get\nhere, I assure you,” he observed, as he warmed his hands over the\nflame. “One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite\nsoft yet.”\n\n“But why are you come?” I could not forbear saying.\n\n“Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask\nit, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my\nmute books and empty rooms. Besides, since yesterday I have experienced\nthe excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who\nis impatient to hear the sequel.”\n\nHe sat down. I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I\nbegan to fear his wits were touched. If he were insane, however, his\nwas a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that\nhandsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it\ndid just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and\nlet the firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where\nit grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so\nplainly graved. I waited, expecting he would say something I could at\nleast comprehend; but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his\nlip: he was thinking. It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his\nface. A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was\nmoved to say—\n\n“I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that\nyou should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own\nhealth.”\n\n“Not at all,” said he: “I care for myself when necessary. I am well\nnow. What do you see amiss in me?”\n\nThis was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed\nthat my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous. I\nwas silenced.\n\nHe still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye\ndwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say\nsomething, I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the\ndoor, which was behind him.\n\n“No, no!” he responded shortly and somewhat testily.\n\n“Well,” I reflected, “if you won’t talk, you may be still; I’ll let you\nalone now, and return to my book.”\n\nSo I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of “Marmion.” He soon\nstirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out\na morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in\nsilence, folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation. It was vain\nto try to read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I,\nin impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but\ntalk I would.\n\n“Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?”\n\n“Not since the letter I showed you a week ago.”\n\n“There has not been any change made about your own arrangements? You\nwill not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?”\n\n“I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me.” Baffled so\nfar, I changed my ground. I bethought myself to talk about the school\nand my scholars.\n\n“Mary Garrett’s mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this\nmorning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry\nClose—they would have come to-day but for the snow.”\n\n“Indeed!”\n\n“Mr. Oliver pays for two.”\n\n“Does he?”\n\n“He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“Was it your suggestion?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Whose, then?”\n\n“His daughter’s, I think.”\n\n“It is like her: she is so good-natured.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nAgain came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes. It\naroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.\n\n“Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire,” he said.\n\nWondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.\n\n“Half-an-hour ago,” he pursued, “I spoke of my impatience to hear the\nsequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better\nmanaged by my assuming the narrator’s part, and converting you into a\nlistener. Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story\nwill sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often\nregain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips. For the\nrest, whether trite or novel, it is short.\n\n“Twenty years ago, a poor curate—never mind his name at this\nmoment—fell in love with a rich man’s daughter; she fell in love with\nhim, and married him, against the advice of all her friends, who\nconsequently disowned her immediately after the wedding. Before two\nyears passed, the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by\nside under one slab. (I have seen their grave; it formed part of the\npavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old\ncathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in ——shire.) They left a\ndaughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in her lap—cold as\nthat of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night. Charity carried\nthe friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it\nwas reared by an aunt-in-law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of\nGateshead. You start—did you hear a noise? I daresay it is only a rat\nscrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn\nbefore I had it repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted\nby rats.—To proceed. Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it\nwas happy or not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at\nthe end of that time she transferred it to a place you know—being no\nother than Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself. It seems\nher career there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a\nteacher, like yourself—really it strikes me there are parallel points\nin her history and yours—she left it to be a governess: there, again,\nyour fates were analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a\ncertain Mr. Rochester.”\n\n“Mr. Rivers!” I interrupted.\n\n“I can guess your feelings,” he said, “but restrain them for a while: I\nhave nearly finished; hear me to the end. Of Mr. Rochester’s character\nI know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable\nmarriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered\nhe had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic. What his subsequent conduct\nand proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event\ntranspired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was\ndiscovered she was gone—no one could tell when, where, or how. She had\nleft Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had\nbeen vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of\ninformation could be gathered respecting her. Yet that she should be\nfound is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been\nput in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr.\nBriggs, a solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted. Is\nit not an odd tale?”\n\n“Just tell me this,” said I, “and since you know so much, you surely\n_can_ tell it me—what of Mr. Rochester? How and where is he? What is he\ndoing? Is he well?”\n\n“I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never\nmentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have\nadverted to. You should rather ask the name of the governess—the nature\nof the event which requires her appearance.”\n\n“Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then? Did no one see Mr. Rochester?”\n\n“I suppose not.”\n\n“But they wrote to him?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\n“And what did he say? Who has his letters?”\n\n“Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from\nMr. Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed ‘Alice Fairfax.’”\n\nI felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he\nhad in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation\nto some former haunt on the Continent. And what opiate for his severe\nsufferings—what object for his strong passions—had he sought there? I\ndared not answer the question. Oh, my poor master—once almost my\nhusband—whom I had often called “my dear Edward!”\n\n“He must have been a bad man,” observed Mr. Rivers.\n\n“You don’t know him—don’t pronounce an opinion upon him,” I said, with\nwarmth.\n\n“Very well,” he answered quietly: “and indeed my head is otherwise\noccupied than with him: I have my tale to finish. Since you won’t ask\nthe governess’s name, I must tell it of my own accord. Stay! I have it\nhere—it is always more satisfactory to see important points written\ndown, fairly committed to black and white.”\n\nAnd the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought\nthrough; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of\npaper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of\nultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the\nportrait-cover. He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced\nin Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words “JANE EYRE”—the work\ndoubtless of some moment of abstraction.\n\n“Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:” he said, “the advertisements\ndemanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.—I confess I had my\nsuspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once\nresolved into certainty. You own the name and renounce the _alias_?”\n\n“Yes—yes; but where is Mr. Briggs? He perhaps knows more of Mr.\nRochester than you do.”\n\n“Briggs is in London. I should doubt his knowing anything at all about\nMr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested. Meantime,\nyou forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why\nMr. Briggs sought after you—what he wanted with you.”\n\n“Well, what did he want?”\n\n“Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that\nhe has left you all his property, and that you are now rich—merely\nthat—nothing more.”\n\n“I!—rich?”\n\n“Yes, you, rich—quite an heiress.”\n\nSilence succeeded.\n\n“You must prove your identity of course,” resumed St. John presently:\n“a step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on\nimmediate possession. Your fortune is vested in the English funds;\nBriggs has the will and the necessary documents.”\n\nHere was a new card turned up! It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted\nin a moment from indigence to wealth—a very fine thing; but not a\nmatter one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once. And then\nthere are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving:\n_this_ is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it:\nall its associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are\nthe same. One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing\none has got a fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to\nponder business; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave\ncares, and we contain ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn\nbrow.\n\nBesides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,\nDeath, Funeral. My uncle I had heard was dead—my only relative; ever\nsince being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of\none day seeing him: now, I never should. And then this money came only\nto me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self. It\nwas a grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious—yes, I\nfelt that—_that_ thought swelled my heart.\n\n“You unbend your forehead at last,” said Mr. Rivers. “I thought Medusa\nhad looked at you, and that you were turning to stone. Perhaps now you\nwill ask how much you are worth?”\n\n“How much am I worth?”\n\n“Oh, a trifle! Nothing of course to speak of—twenty thousand pounds, I\nthink they say—but what is that?”\n\n“Twenty thousand pounds?”\n\nHere was a new stunner—I had been calculating on four or five thousand.\nThis news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I\nhad never heard laugh before, laughed now.\n\n“Well,” said he, “if you had committed a murder, and I had told you\nyour crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast.”\n\n“It is a large sum—don’t you think there is a mistake?”\n\n“No mistake at all.”\n\n“Perhaps you have read the figures wrong—it may be two thousand!”\n\n“It is written in letters, not figures,—twenty thousand.”\n\nI again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical\npowers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions\nfor a hundred. Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.\n\n“If it were not such a very wild night,” he said, “I would send Hannah\ndown to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left\nalone. But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as\nI: her legs are not quite so long: so I must e’en leave you to your\nsorrows. Good-night.”\n\nHe was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.\n\n“Stop one minute!” I cried.\n\n“Well?”\n\n“It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he\nknew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way\nplace, had the power to aid in my discovery.”\n\n“Oh! I am a clergyman,” he said; “and the clergy are often appealed to\nabout odd matters.” Again the latch rattled.\n\n“No; that does not satisfy me!” I exclaimed: and indeed there was\nsomething in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of\nallaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.\n\n“It is a very strange piece of business,” I added; “I must know more\nabout it.”\n\n“Another time.”\n\n“No; to-night!—to-night!” and as he turned from the door, I placed\nmyself between it and him. He looked rather embarrassed.\n\n“You certainly shall not go till you have told me all,” I said.\n\n“I would rather not just now.”\n\n“You shall!—you must!”\n\n“I would rather Diana or Mary informed you.”\n\nOf course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified\nit must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.\n\n“But I apprised you that I was a hard man,” said he, “difficult to\npersuade.”\n\n“And I am a hard woman,—impossible to put off.”\n\n\nAnd I am a hard woman,—impossible to put off\n\n“And then,” he pursued, “I am cold: no fervour infects me.”\n\n“Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice. The blaze there has thawed\nall the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to\nmy floor, and made it like a trampled street. As you hope ever to be\nforgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a\nsanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know.”\n\n“Well, then,” he said, “I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your\nperseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping. Besides, you must\nknow some day,—as well now as later. Your name is Jane Eyre?”\n\n“Of course: that was all settled before.”\n\n“You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?—that I was\nchristened St. John Eyre Rivers?”\n\n“No, indeed! I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your\ninitials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I\nnever asked for what name it stood. But what then? Surely—”\n\nI stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,\nthe thought that rushed upon me—that embodied itself,—that, in a\nsecond, stood out a strong, solid probability. Circumstances knit\nthemselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been\nlying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,—every\nring was perfect, the connection complete. I knew, by instinct, how the\nmatter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot\nexpect the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must\nrepeat his explanation.\n\n“My mother’s name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who\nmarried Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,\nmerchant, late of Funchal, Madeira. Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre’s\nsolicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle’s death,\nand to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman’s\norphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never\nforgiven, between him and my father. He wrote again a few weeks since,\nto intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything\nof her. A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to\nfind her out. You know the rest.” Again he was going, but I set my back\nagainst the door.\n\n“Do let me speak,” I said; “let me have one moment to draw breath and\nreflect.” I paused—he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed\nenough. I resumed—\n\n“Your mother was my father’s sister?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“My aunt, consequently?”\n\nHe bowed.\n\n“My uncle John was your uncle John? You, Diana, and Mary are his\nsister’s children, as I am his brother’s child?”\n\n“Undeniably.”\n\n“You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows\nfrom the same source?”\n\n“We are cousins; yes.”\n\nI surveyed him. It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud\nof,—one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,\nwhen I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with\ngenuine affection and admiration. The two girls, on whom, kneeling down\non the wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor\nHouse kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and\ndespair, were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman\nwho had found me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.\nGlorious discovery to a lonely wretch! This was wealth indeed!—wealth\nto the heart!—a mine of pure, genial affections. This was a blessing,\nbright, vivid, and exhilarating;—not like the ponderous gift of gold:\nrich and welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight. I now\nclapped my hands in sudden joy—my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.\n\n“Oh, I am glad!—I am glad!” I exclaimed.\n\nSt. John smiled. “Did I not say you neglected essential points to\npursue trifles?” he asked. “You were serious when I told you you had\ngot a fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited.”\n\n“What _can_ you mean? It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters\nand don’t care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three\nrelations,—or two, if you don’t choose to be counted,—are born into my\nworld full-grown. I say again, I am glad!”\n\nI walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the\nthoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle\nthem:—thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere\nlong. I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending\nstars,—every one lit me to a purpose or delight. Those who had saved my\nlife, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.\nThey were under a yoke,—I could free them: they were scattered,—I could\nreunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be\ntheirs too. Were we not four? Twenty thousand pounds shared equally\nwould be five thousand each, justice—enough and to spare: justice would\nbe done,—mutual happiness secured. Now the wealth did not weigh on me:\nnow it was not a mere bequest of coin,—it was a legacy of life, hope,\nenjoyment.\n\nHow I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot\ntell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind\nme, and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it. He also\nadvised me to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness\nand distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.\n\n“Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow,” I said, “and tell them to come\nhome directly. Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with\na thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well.”\n\n“Tell me where I can get you a glass of water,” said St. John; “you\nmust really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings.”\n\n“Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?\nWill it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and\nsettle down like an ordinary mortal?”\n\n“You wander: your head becomes confused. I have been too abrupt in\ncommunicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength.”\n\n“Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it\nis you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand.”\n\n“Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should\ncomprehend better.”\n\n“Explain! What is there to explain? You cannot fail to see that twenty\nthousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the\nnephew and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?\nWhat I want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of\nthe fortune that has accrued to them.”\n\n“To you, you mean.”\n\n“I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any\nother. I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly\nungrateful. Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.\nI like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and\nMary, and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary. It would\nplease and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment\nand oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be\nmine in justice, though it might in law. I abandon to you, then, what\nis absolutely superfluous to me. Let there be no opposition, and no\ndiscussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the\npoint at once.”\n\n“This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such\na matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid.”\n\n“Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice\nof the case?”\n\n“I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.\nBesides, the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his\nown efforts; he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to\nyou. After all, justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear\nconscience, consider it absolutely your own.”\n\n“With me,” said I, “it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of\nconscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an\nopportunity of doing so. Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a\nyear, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught\na glimpse—that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning\nto myself lifelong friends.”\n\n“You think so now,” rejoined St. John, “because you do not know what it\nis to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a\nnotion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the\nplace it would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would\nopen to you: you cannot—”\n\n“And you,” I interrupted, “cannot at all imagine the craving I have for\nfraternal and sisterly love. I never had a home, I never had brothers\nor sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to\nadmit me and own me, are you?”\n\n“Jane, I will be your brother—my sisters will be your sisters—without\nstipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights.”\n\n“Brother? Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues! Sisters? Yes;\nslaving amongst strangers! I, wealthy—gorged with gold I never earned\nand do not merit! You, penniless! Famous equality and fraternisation!\nClose union! Intimate attachment!”\n\n“But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness\nmay be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may\nmarry.”\n\n“Nonsense, again! Marry! I don’t want to marry, and never shall marry.”\n\n“That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of\nthe excitement under which you labour.”\n\n“It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my\ninclinations to the bare thought of marriage. No one would take me for\nlove; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money\nspeculation. And I do not want a stranger—unsympathising, alien,\ndifferent from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full\nfellow-feeling. Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the\nwords I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them\nsincerely.”\n\n“I think I can. I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know\non what my affection for them is grounded,—respect for their worth and\nadmiration of their talents. You too have principle and mind: your\ntastes and habits resemble Diana’s and Mary’s; your presence is always\nagreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time\nfound a salutary solace. I feel I can easily and naturally make room in\nmy heart for you, as my third and youngest sister.”\n\n“Thank you: that contents me for to-night. Now you had better go; for\nif you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some\nmistrustful scruple.”\n\n“And the school, Miss Eyre? It must now be shut up, I suppose?”\n\n“No. I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute.”\n\nHe smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.\n\nI need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments\nI used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished. My\ntask was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved—as my\ncousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on\nmaking a just division of the property—as they must in their own hearts\nhave felt the equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been\ninnately conscious that in my place they would have done precisely what\nI wished to do—they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the\naffair to arbitration. The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able\nlawyer: both coincided in my opinion: I carried my point. The\ninstruments of transfer were drawn out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I,\neach became possessed of a competency.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nIt was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of\ngeneral holiday approached. I now closed Morton school, taking care\nthat the parting should not be barren on my side. Good fortune opens\nthe hand as well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we\nhave largely received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual\nebullition of the sensations. I had long felt with pleasure that many\nof my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness\nwas confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.\nDeep was my gratification to find I had really a place in their\nunsophisticated hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass\nin future that I did not visit them, and give them an hour’s teaching\nin their school.\n\nMr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty\ngirls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in\nmy hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some\nhalf-dozen of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and\nwell-informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the British\npeasantry. And that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British\npeasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of\nany in Europe: since those days I have seen paysannes and Bäuerinnen;\nand the best of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted,\ncompared with my Morton girls.\n\n“Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?”\nasked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone. “Does not the consciousness of\nhaving done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?”\n\n“Doubtless.”\n\n“And you have only toiled a few months! Would not a life devoted to the\ntask of regenerating your race be well spent?”\n\n“Yes,” I said; “but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my\nown faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people. I must\nenjoy them now; don’t recall either my mind or body to the school; I am\nout of it and disposed for full holiday.”\n\nHe looked grave. “What now? What sudden eagerness is this you evince?\nWhat are you going to do?”\n\n“To be active: as active as I can. And first I must beg you to set\nHannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you.”\n\n“Do you want her?”\n\n“Yes, to go with me to Moor House. Diana and Mary will be at home in a\nweek, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival.”\n\n“I understand. I thought you were for flying off on some excursion. It\nis better so: Hannah shall go with you.”\n\n“Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom\nkey: I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning.”\n\nHe took it. “You give it up very gleefully,” said he; “I don’t quite\nunderstand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what\nemployment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are\nrelinquishing. What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you\nnow?”\n\n“My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force\nof the expression?)—to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;\nmy next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of\ncloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair,\ntable, bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go\nnear to ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room;\nand lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are\nexpected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs,\nsorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes,\nchopping up of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other\nculinary rites, as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the\nuninitiated like you. My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an\nabsolutely perfect state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next\nThursday; and my ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome\nwhen they come.”\n\nSt. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.\n\n“It is all very well for the present,” said he; “but seriously, I trust\nthat when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little\nhigher than domestic endearments and household joys.”\n\n“The best things the world has!” I interrupted.\n\n“No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt\nto make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful.”\n\n“I mean, on the contrary, to be busy.”\n\n“Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months’ grace I allow you for\nthe full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with\nthis late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will\nbegin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and\nthe selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence. I hope\nyour energies will then once more trouble you with their strength.”\n\nI looked at him with surprise. “St. John,” I said, “I think you are\nalmost wicked to talk so. I am disposed to be as content as a queen,\nand you try to stir me up to restlessness! To what end?”\n\n“To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to\nyour keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict\naccount. Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously—I warn you of\nthat. And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you\nthrow yourself into commonplace home pleasures. Don’t cling so\ntenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an\nadequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects. Do\nyou hear, Jane?”\n\n“Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek. I feel I have adequate cause\nto be happy, and I _will_ be happy. Goodbye!”\n\nHappy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she\nwas charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house\nturned topsy-turvy—how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.\nAnd really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was\ndelightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had\nmade. I had previously taken a journey to S—— to purchase some new\nfurniture: my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what\nalterations I pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that\npurpose. The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they\nwere: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing\nagain the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the\nspectacle of the smartest innovations. Still some novelty was\nnecessary, to give to their return the piquancy with which I wished it\nto be invested. Dark handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement\nof some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze,\nnew coverings, and mirrors, and dressing-cases, for the toilet tables,\nanswered the end: they looked fresh without being glaring. A spare\nparlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with old mahogany and\ncrimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets on the\nstairs. When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model\nof bright modest snugness within, as it was, at this season, a specimen\nof wintry waste and desert dreariness without.\n\nThe eventful Thursday at length came. They were expected about dark,\nand ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in\nperfect trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.\n\nSt. John arrived first. I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the\nhouse till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the\ncommotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls\nsufficed to scare him to estrangement. He found me in the kitchen,\nwatching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.\nApproaching the hearth, he asked, “If I was at last satisfied with\nhousemaid’s work?” I answered by inviting him to accompany me on a\ngeneral inspection of the result of my labours. With some difficulty, I\ngot him to make the tour of the house. He just looked in at the doors I\nopened; and when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he said I\nmust have gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have\neffected such considerable changes in so short a time: but not a\nsyllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of his\nabode.\n\nThis silence damped me. I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed\nsome old associations he valued. I inquired whether this was the case:\nno doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.\n\n“Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously\nrespected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed\nmore thought on the matter than it was worth. How many minutes, for\ninstance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very\nroom?—By-the-bye, could I tell him where such a book was?”\n\nI showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing\nto his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.\n\nNow, I did not like this, reader. St. John was a good man; but I began\nto feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and\ncold. The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for\nhim—its peaceful enjoyments no charm. Literally, he lived only to\naspire—after what was good and great, certainly; but still he would\nnever rest, nor approve of others resting round him. As I looked at his\nlofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone—at his fine lineaments\nfixed in study—I comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a\ngood husband: that it would be a trying thing to be his wife. I\nunderstood, as by inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver;\nI agreed with him that it was but a love of the senses. I comprehended\nhow he should despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised\nover him; how he should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should\nmistrust its ever conducting permanently to his happiness or hers. I\nsaw he was of the material from which nature hews her heroes—Christian\nand Pagan—her lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast\nbulwark for great interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too\noften a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of place.\n\n“This parlour is not his sphere,” I reflected: “the Himalayan ridge or\nCaffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him\nbetter. Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his\nelement: there his faculties stagnate—they cannot develop or appear to\nadvantage. It is in scenes of strife and danger—where courage is\nproved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked—that he will speak\nand move, the leader and superior. A merry child would have the\nadvantage of him on this hearth. He is right to choose a missionary’s\ncareer—I see it now.”\n\n“They are coming! they are coming!” cried Hannah, throwing open the\nparlour door. At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully. Out I ran.\nIt was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible. Hannah soon had\na lantern lit. The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened\nthe door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out. In a\nminute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary’s\nsoft cheek, then with Diana’s flowing curls. They laughed—kissed\nme—then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked\neagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened\ninto the house.\n\nThey were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and\nchilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances\nexpanded to the cheerful firelight. While the driver and Hannah brought\nin the boxes, they demanded St. John. At this moment he advanced from\nthe parlour. They both threw their arms round his neck at once. He gave\neach one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a\nwhile to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would\nsoon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.\n\nI had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give\nhospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.\nThey were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;\nwith the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:\nthey expressed their gratification ungrudgingly. I had the pleasure of\nfeeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I\nhad done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.\n\nSweet was that evening. My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so\neloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St.\nJohn’s taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in\ntheir glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise. The\nevent of the day—that is, the return of Diana and Mary—pleased him; but\nthe accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee\nof reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come. In\nthe very meridian of the night’s enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a\nrap was heard at the door. Hannah entered with the intimation that “a\npoor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see\nhis mother, who was drawing away.”\n\n“Where does she live, Hannah?”\n\n“Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss\nall the way.”\n\n“Tell him I will go.”\n\n“I’m sure, sir, you had better not. It’s the worst road to travel after\ndark that can be: there’s no track at all over the bog. And then it is\nsuch a bitter night—the keenest wind you ever felt. You had better send\nword, sir, that you will be there in the morning.”\n\nBut he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without\none objection, one murmur, he departed. It was then nine o’clock: he\ndid not return till midnight. Starved and tired enough he was: but he\nlooked happier than when he set out. He had performed an act of duty;\nmade an exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on\nbetter terms with himself.\n\nI am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience. It was\nChristmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a\nsort of merry domestic dissipation. The air of the moors, the freedom\nof home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary’s spirits like\nsome life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from\nnoon till night. They could always talk; and their discourse, witty,\npithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to,\nand sharing in it, to doing anything else. St. John did not rebuke our\nvivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his\nparish was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business\nin visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.\n\nOne morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for\nsome minutes, asked him, “If his plans were yet unchanged.”\n\n“Unchanged and unchangeable,” was the reply. And he proceeded to inform\nus that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the\nensuing year.\n\n“And Rosamond Oliver?” suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her\nlips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a\ngesture as if wishing to recall them. St. John had a book in his\nhand—it was his unsocial custom to read at meals—he closed it, and\nlooked up.\n\n“Rosamond Oliver,” said he, “is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one\nof the best connected and most estimable residents in S——, grandson and\nheir to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father\nyesterday.”\n\nHis sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:\nhe was serene as glass.\n\n“The match must have been got up hastily,” said Diana: “they cannot\nhave known each other long.”\n\n“But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S——. But\nwhere there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where\nthe connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary:\nthey will be married as soon as S—— Place, which Sir Frederic gives up\nto them, can be refitted for their reception.”\n\nThe first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt\ntempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little\nto need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I\nexperienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already\nhazarded. Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve\nwas again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it. He\nhad not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he\ncontinually made little chilling differences between us, which did not\nat all tend to the development of cordiality: in short, now that I was\nacknowledged his kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I\nfelt the distance between us to be far greater than when he had known\nme only as the village schoolmistress. When I remembered how far I had\nonce been admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his\npresent frigidity.\n\nSuch being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his\nhead suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said—\n\n“You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.”\n\nStartled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a\nmoment’s hesitation I answered—\n\n“But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose\ntriumphs have cost them too dear? Would not such another ruin you?”\n\n“I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be\ncalled upon to contend for such another. The event of the conflict is\ndecisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!” So saying, he\nreturned to his papers and his silence.\n\nAs our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana’s, Mary’s, and mine) settled\ninto a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular\nstudies, St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room,\nsometimes for hours together. While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course\nof encyclopædic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken,\nand I fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that\nof some Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary\nto his plans.\n\nThus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and\nabsorbed enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the\noutlandish-looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing\nupon us, his fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation:\nif caught, it would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it\nreturned searchingly to our table. I wondered what it meant: I\nwondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit\non an occasion that seemed to me of small moment, namely, my weekly\nvisit to Morton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the day\nwas unfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and his\nsisters urged me not to go, he would invariably make light of their\nsolicitude, and encourage me to accomplish the task without regard to\nthe elements.\n\n“Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her,” he would say: “she\ncan bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as\nwell as any of us. Her constitution is both sound and elastic;—better\ncalculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust.”\n\nAnd when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little\nweather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur\nwould be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the\nreverse was a special annoyance.\n\nOne afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really\nhad a cold. His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading\nSchiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls. As I exchanged\na translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I\nfound myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye. How\nlong it had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I\ncannot tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment\nsuperstitious—as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.\n\n“Jane, what are you doing?”\n\n“Learning German.”\n\n“I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.”\n\n“You are not in earnest?”\n\n“In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why.”\n\nHe then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was\nhimself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget\nthe commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with\nwhom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them\nthoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time\nbetween me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw\nI could sit at a task the longest of the three. Would I do him this\nfavour? I should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it\nwanted now barely three months to his departure.\n\nSt. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every\nimpression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved\nand permanent. I consented. When Diana and Mary returned, the former\nfound her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and\nboth she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them\nto such a step. He answered quietly—\n\n“I know it.”\n\nI found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting\nmaster: he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his\nexpectations, he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation. By\ndegrees, he acquired a certain influence over me that took away my\nliberty of mind: his praise and notice were more restraining than his\nindifference. I could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by,\nbecause a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at\nleast in me) was distasteful to him. I was so fully aware that only\nserious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his presence\nevery effort to sustain or follow any other became vain: I fell under a\nfreezing spell. When he said “go,” I went; “come,” I came; “do this,” I\ndid it. But I did not love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had\ncontinued to neglect me.\n\nOne evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him,\nbidding him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and,\nas was equally his custom, he gave me his hand. Diana, who chanced to\nbe in a frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his\nwill; for hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed—\n\n“St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don’t treat\nher as such: you should kiss her too.”\n\nShe pushed me towards him. I thought Diana very provoking, and felt\nuncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.\nJohn bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine,\nhis eyes questioned my eyes piercingly—he kissed me. There are no such\nthings as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my\necclesiastical cousin’s salute belonged to one of these classes; but\nthere may be experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss. When\ngiven, he viewed me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure\nI did not blush; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt\nas if this kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters. He never omitted the\nceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I\nunderwent it, seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.\n\nAs for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt\ndaily more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my\nfaculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to\nthe adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation. He wanted\nto train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to\naspire to the standard he uplifted. The thing was as impossible as to\nmould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give\nto my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his\nown.\n\nNot his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present. Of\nlate it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat\nat my heart and drained my happiness at its source—the evil of\nsuspense.\n\nPerhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these\nchanges of place and fortune. Not for a moment. His idea was still with\nme, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a\nsand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a\ntablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed. The craving\nto know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at\nMorton, I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now\nat Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.\n\nIn the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the\nwill, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester’s present\nresidence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was\nquite ignorant of all concerning him. I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,\nentreating information on the subject. I had calculated with certainty\non this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early\nanswer. I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but\nwhen two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and\nbrought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.\n\nI wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.\nRenewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some\nweeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word\nreached me. When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died\nout, and then I felt dark indeed.\n\nA fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy. Summer\napproached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished\nto accompany me to the sea-side. This St. John opposed; he said I did\nnot want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too\npurposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying\ndeficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and\ngrew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,\nnever thought of resisting him—I could not resist him.\n\nOne day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb\nwas occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment. Hannah had told me\nin the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take\nit, almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me\nat last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.\nThe bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring\nover the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe,\nmy eyes filled again.\n\nSt. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my\nvoice failed me: words were lost in sobs. He and I were the only\noccupants of the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the\ndrawing-room, Mary was gardening—it was a very fine May day, clear,\nsunny, and breezy. My companion expressed no surprise at this emotion,\nnor did he question me as to its cause; he only said—\n\n“We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.” And\nwhile I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,\nleaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye\nof science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient’s\nmalady. Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something\nabout not being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and\nsucceeded in completing it. St. John put away my books and his, locked\nhis desk, and said—\n\n“Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me.”\n\n“I will call Diana and Mary.”\n\n“No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you. Put\non your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the\nhead of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment.”\n\nI know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my\ndealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own,\nbetween absolute submission and determined revolt. I have always\nfaithfully observed the one, up to the very moment of bursting,\nsometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither\npresent circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to\nmutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John’s directions; and in\nten minutes I was treading the wild track of the glen, side by side\nwith him.\n\nThe breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents\nof heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending\nthe ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and\nclear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the\nfirmament. As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf,\nmossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white\nflower, and spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills,\nmeantime, shut us quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to\ntheir very core.\n\n“Let us rest here,” said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers\nof a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck\nrushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the\nmountain shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag\nfor gem—where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the\nfresh for the frowning—where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude,\nand a last refuge for silence.\n\nI took a seat: St. John stood near me. He looked up the pass and down\nthe hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to\ntraverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat,\nlet the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow. He seemed in communion\nwith the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to\nsomething.\n\n“And I shall see it again,” he said aloud, “in dreams when I sleep by\nthe Ganges: and again in a more remote hour—when another slumber\novercomes me—on the shore of a darker stream!”\n\nStrange words of a strange love! An austere patriot’s passion for his\nfatherland! He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to\nme nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced—\n\n“Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman\nwhich sails on the 20th of June.”\n\n“God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work,” I answered.\n\n“Yes,” said he, “there is my glory and joy. I am the servant of an\ninfallible Master. I am not going out under human guidance, subject to\nthe defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my\nking, my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect. It seems strange to\nme that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,—to\njoin in the same enterprise.”\n\n“All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish\nto march with the strong.”\n\n“I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as\nare worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it.”\n\n“Those are few in number, and difficult to discover.”\n\n“You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up—to urge and\nexhort them to the effort—to show them what their gifts are, and why\nthey were given—to speak Heaven’s message in their ear,—to offer them,\ndirect from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen.”\n\n“If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts\nbe the first to inform them of it?”\n\nI felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I\ntrembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and\nrivet the spell.\n\n“And what does _your_ heart say?” demanded St. John.\n\n“My heart is mute,—my heart is mute,” I answered, struck and thrilled.\n\n“Then I must speak for it,” continued the deep, relentless voice.\n“Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer.”\n\nThe glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved! It was as if I had heard\na summons from Heaven—as if a visionary messenger, like him of\nMacedonia, had enounced, “Come over and help us!” But I was no\napostle,—I could not behold the herald,—I could not receive his call.\n\n“Oh, St. John!” I cried, “have some mercy!”\n\nI appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,\nknew neither mercy nor remorse. He continued—\n\n“God and nature intended you for a missionary’s wife. It is not\npersonal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for\nlabour, not for love. A missionary’s wife you must—shall be. You shall\nbe mine: I claim you—not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign’s\nservice.”\n\n“I am not fit for it: I have no vocation,” I said.\n\nHe had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by\nthem. Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his\narms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for\na long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to\nlast him to its close—resolved, however, that that close should be\nconquest for him.\n\n“Humility, Jane,” said he, “is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you\nsay right that you are not fit for the work. Who is fit for it? Or who,\nthat ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons? I,\nfor instance, am but dust and ashes. With St. Paul, I acknowledge\nmyself the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my\npersonal vileness to daunt me. I know my Leader: that He is just as\nwell as mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform\na great task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence,\nsupply the inadequacy of the means to the end. Think like me,\nJane—trust like me. It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not\ndoubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness.”\n\n“I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary\nlabours.”\n\n“There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you\nyour task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment\nto moment. This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your\npowers) you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require\nmy help.”\n\n“But my powers—where are they for this undertaking? I do not feel them.\nNothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk. I am sensible of no light\nkindling—no life quickening—no voice counselling or cheering. Oh, I\nwish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a\nrayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths—the\nfear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!”\n\n“I have an answer for you—hear it. I have watched you ever since we\nfirst met: I have made you my study for ten months. I have proved you\nin that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited? In the\nvillage school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,\nlabour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could\nperform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.\nIn the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read\na mind clear of the vice of Demas:—lucre had no undue power over you.\nIn the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four\nshares, keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others\nto the claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in\nthe flame and excitement of sacrifice. In the tractability with which,\nat my wish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and\nadopted another because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity\nwith which you have since persevered in it—in the unflagging energy and\nunshaken temper with which you have met its difficulties—I acknowledge\nthe complement of the qualities I seek. Jane, you are docile, diligent,\ndisinterested, faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and\nvery heroic: cease to mistrust yourself—I can trust you unreservedly.\nAs a conductress of Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women,\nyour assistance will be to me invaluable.”\n\nMy iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure\nstep. Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in\nmaking the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear. My\nwork, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed\nitself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping\nhand. He waited for an answer. I demanded a quarter of an hour to\nthink, before I again hazarded a reply.\n\n“Very willingly,” he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance\nup the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay\nstill.\n\n\nHe threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still\n\n“I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge\nthat,” I meditated,—“that is, if life be spared me. But I feel mine is\nnot the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun. What then?\nHe does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign\nme, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me. The case is\nvery plain before me. In leaving England, I should leave a loved but\nempty land—Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what\ncan that ever be to me? My business is to live without him now: nothing\nso absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting\nsome impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.\nOf course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life\nto replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly\nthe most glorious man can adopt or God assign? Is it not, by its noble\ncares and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void\nleft by uptorn affections and demolished hopes? I believe I must say,\nYes—and yet I shudder. Alas! If I join St. John, I abandon half myself:\nif I go to India, I go to premature death. And how will the interval\nbetween leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?\nOh, I know well! That, too, is very clear to my vision. By straining to\nsatisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him—to the\nfinest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.\nIf I _do_ go with him—if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will\nmake it absolutely: I will throw all on the altar—heart, vitals, the\nentire victim. He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will\nshow him energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never\nsuspected. Yes, I can work as hard as he can, and with as little\ngrudging.\n\n“Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item—one\ndreadful item. It is—that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of\na husband’s heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which\nthe stream is foaming in yonder gorge. He prizes me as a soldier would\na good weapon; and that is all. Unmarried to him, this would never\ngrieve me; but can I let him complete his calculations—coolly put into\npractice his plans—go through the wedding ceremony? Can I receive from\nhim the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he\nwould scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?\nCan I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a\nsacrifice made on principle? No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous. I\nwill never undergo it. As his sister, I might accompany him—not as his\nwife: I will tell him so.”\n\nI looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;\nhis face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen. He started to\nhis feet and approached me.\n\n“I am ready to go to India, if I may go free.”\n\n“Your answer requires a commentary,” he said; “it is not clear.”\n\n“You have hitherto been my adopted brother—I, your adopted sister: let\nus continue as such: you and I had better not marry.”\n\nHe shook his head. “Adopted fraternity will not do in this case. If you\nwere my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek\nno wife. But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed\nby marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves\nto any other plan. Do you not see it, Jane? Consider a moment—your\nstrong sense will guide you.”\n\nI did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to\nthe fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and\ntherefore it inferred we ought not to marry. I said so. “St. John,” I\nreturned, “I regard you as a brother—you, me as a sister: so let us\ncontinue.”\n\n“We cannot—we cannot,” he answered, with short, sharp determination:\n“it would not do. You have said you will go with me to India:\nremember—you have said that.”\n\n“Conditionally.”\n\n“Well—well. To the main point—the departure with me from England, the\nco-operation with me in my future labours—you do not object. You have\nalready as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent\nto withdraw it. You have but one end to keep in view—how the work you\nhave undertaken can best be done. Simplify your complicated interests,\nfeelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one\npurpose: that of fulfilling with effect—with power—the mission of your\ngreat Master. To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother—that\nis a loose tie—but a husband. I, too, do not want a sister: a sister\nmight any day be taken from me. I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can\ninfluence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death.”\n\nI shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow—his hold on\nmy limbs.\n\n“Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you.”\n\n“One fitted to my purpose, you mean—fitted to my vocation. Again I tell\nyou it is not the insignificant private individual—the mere man, with\nthe man’s selfish senses—I wish to mate: it is the missionary.”\n\n“And I will give the missionary my energies—it is all he wants—but not\nmyself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel. For\nthem he has no use: I retain them.”\n\n“You cannot—you ought not. Do you think God will be satisfied with half\nan oblation? Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice? It is the cause of\nGod I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you. I cannot accept\non His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire.”\n\n“Oh! I will give my heart to God,” I said. “_You_ do not want it.”\n\nI will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed\nsarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the\nfeeling that accompanied it. I had silently feared St. John till now,\nbecause I had not understood him. He had held me in awe, because he had\nheld me in doubt. How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could\nnot heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this\nconference: the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes. I\nsaw his fallibilities: I comprehended them. I understood that, sitting\nthere where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form\nbefore me, I sat at the feet of a man, erring as I. The veil fell from\nhis hardness and despotism. Having felt in him the presence of these\nqualities, I felt his imperfection and took courage. I was with an\nequal—one with whom I might argue—one whom, if I saw good, I might\nresist.\n\nHe was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently\nrisked an upward glance at his countenance. His eye, bent on me,\nexpressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry. “Is she sarcastic,\nand sarcastic to _me!_” it seemed to say. “What does this signify?”\n\n“Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter,” he said ere long;\n“one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin. I\ntrust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart\nto God: it is all I want. Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it\non your Maker, the advancement of that Maker’s spiritual kingdom on\nearth will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do\nat once whatever furthers that end. You will see what impetus would be\ngiven to your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in\nmarriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent conformity\nto the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all\nminor caprices—all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling—all\nscruple about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal\ninclination—you will hasten to enter into that union at once.”\n\n“Shall I?” I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in\ntheir harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his\nbrow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and\nsearching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied\nmyself in idea _his wife_. Oh! it would never do! As his curate, his\ncomrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that\ncapacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that\noffice; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;\naccommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his\nineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:\nprofoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other. I should\nsuffer often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body\nwould be under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be\nfree. I should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural\nunenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.\nThere would be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which\nhe never came, and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which\nhis austerity could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march\ntrample down: but as his wife—at his side always, and always\nrestrained, and always checked—forced to keep the fire of my nature\ncontinually low, to compel it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry,\nthough the imprisoned flame consumed vital after vital—_this_ would be\nunendurable.\n\n“St. John!” I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.\n\n“Well?” he answered icily.\n\n“I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary,\nbut not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you.”\n\n“A part of me you must become,” he answered steadily; “otherwise the\nwhole bargain is void. How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with\nme to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me? How can we\nbe for ever together—sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage\ntribes—and unwed?”\n\n“Very well,” I said shortly; “under the circumstances, quite as well as\nif I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like\nyourself.”\n\n“It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as\nsuch: to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.\nAnd for the rest, though you have a man’s vigorous brain, you have a\nwoman’s heart and—it would not do.”\n\n“It would do,” I affirmed with some disdain, “perfectly well. I have a\nwoman’s heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a\ncomrade’s constancy; a fellow-soldier’s frankness, fidelity,\nfraternity, if you like; a neophyte’s respect and submission to his\nhierophant: nothing more—don’t fear.”\n\n“It is what I want,” he said, speaking to himself; “it is just what I\nwant. And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down. Jane,\nyou would not repent marrying me—be certain of that; we _must_ be\nmarried. I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of\nlove would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your\neyes.”\n\n“I scorn your idea of love,” I could not help saying, as I rose up and\nstood before him, leaning my back against the rock. “I scorn the\ncounterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when\nyou offer it.”\n\nHe looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.\nWhether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:\nhe could command his countenance thoroughly.\n\n“I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you,” he said: “I\nthink I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.”\n\nI was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.\n\n“Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have\nbeen roused to speak so unguardedly. You have introduced a topic on\nwhich our natures are at variance—a topic we should never discuss: the\nvery name of love is an apple of discord between us. If the reality\nwere required, what should we do? How should we feel? My dear cousin,\nabandon your scheme of marriage—forget it.”\n\n“No,” said he; “it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which\ncan secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.\nTo-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to\nwhom I should wish to say farewell. I shall be absent a fortnight—take\nthat space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you\nreject it, it is not me you deny, but God. Through my means, He opens\nto you a noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it. Refuse to\nbe my wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease\nand barren obscurity. Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered\nwith those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!”\n\nHe had done. Turning from me, he once more\n\n“Looked to river, looked to hill.”\n\n\nBut this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy\nto hear them uttered. As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in\nhis iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an\naustere and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected\nsubmission—the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has\ndetected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to\nsympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into\nobedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with\nmy perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and\nrepentance.\n\nThat night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to\nforget even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.\nI—who, though I had no love, had much friendship for him—was hurt by\nthe marked omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.\n\n“I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,” said Diana,\n“during your walk on the moor. But go after him; he is now lingering in\nthe passage expecting you—he will make it up.”\n\nI have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather\nbe happy than dignified; and I ran after him—he stood at the foot of\nthe stairs.\n\n“Good-night, St. John,” said I.\n\n“Good-night, Jane,” he replied calmly.\n\n“Then shake hands,” I added.\n\nWhat a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers! He was deeply\ndispleased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm,\nnor tears move him. No happy reconciliation was to be had with him—no\ncheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient\nand placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he\nwas not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he\nhad nothing to forgive, not having been offended.\n\nAnd with that answer he left me. I would much rather he had knocked me\ndown.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nHe did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.\nHe deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me\nfeel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet\nimplacable man can inflict on one who has offended him. Without one\novert act of hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me\nmomently with the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his\nfavour.\n\nNot that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness—not\nthat he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in\nhis power to do so. Both by nature and principle, he was superior to\nthe mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I\nscorned him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as\nlong as he and I lived he never would forget them. I saw by his look,\nwhen he turned to me, that they were always written on the air between\nme and him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and\ntheir echo toned every answer he gave me.\n\nHe did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual\neach morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within\nhim had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian,\nin evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking\napparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the\nspirit of interest and approval which had formerly communicated a\ncertain austere charm to his language and manner. To me, he was in\nreality become no longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright,\nblue gem; his tongue a speaking instrument—nothing more.\n\nAll this was torture to me—refined, lingering torture. It kept up a\nslow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which\nharassed and crushed me altogether. I felt how—if I were his wife, this\ngood man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without\ndrawing from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own\ncrystal conscience the faintest stain of crime. Especially I felt this\nwhen I made any attempt to propitiate him. No ruth met my ruth. _He_\nexperienced no suffering from estrangement—no yearning after\nreconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears\nblistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more\neffect on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or\nmetal. To his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as\nif afraid that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how\ncompletely I was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast;\nand this I am sure he did not by malice, but on principle.\n\nThe night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the\ngarden about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this\nman, alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were\nnear relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his\nfriendship. I went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the\nlittle gate; I spoke to the point at once.\n\n“St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me. Let us be\nfriends.”\n\n“I hope we are friends,” was the unmoved reply; while he still watched\nthe rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I\napproached.\n\n“No, St. John, we are not friends as we were. You know that.”\n\n“Are we not? That is wrong. For my part, I wish you no ill and all\ngood.”\n\n“I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing\nany one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more\nof affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere\nstrangers.”\n\n“Of course,” he said. “Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from\nregarding you as a stranger.”\n\nThis, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling\nenough. Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should\nimmediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly\nthan those feelings could. I deeply venerated my cousin’s talent and\nprinciple. His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me\nseverely. I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.\n\n“Must we part in this way, St. John? And when you go to India, will you\nleave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?”\n\nHe now turned quite from the moon and faced me.\n\n“When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you! What! do you not go to\nIndia?”\n\n“You said I could not unless I married you.”\n\n“And you will not marry me! You adhere to that resolution?”\n\nReader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put\ninto the ice of their questions? How much of the fall of the avalanche\nis in their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their\ndispleasure?\n\n“No. St. John, I will not marry you. I adhere to my resolution.”\n\nThe avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet\ncrash down.\n\n“Once more, why this refusal?” he asked.\n\n“Formerly,” I answered, “because you did not love me; now, I reply,\nbecause you almost hate me. If I were to marry you, you would kill me.\nYou are killing me now.”\n\nHis lips and cheeks turned white—quite white.\n\n“_I should kill you_—_I am killing you_? Your words are such as ought\nnot to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue. They betray an\nunfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem\ninexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even\nuntil seventy-and-seven times.”\n\nI had finished the business now. While earnestly wishing to erase from\nhis mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that\ntenacious surface another and far deeper impression: I had burnt it in.\n\n“Now you will indeed hate me,” I said. “It is useless to attempt to\nconciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you.”\n\nA fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched\non the truth. That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm. I knew\nthe steely ire I had whetted. I was heart-wrung.\n\n“You utterly misinterpret my words,” I said, at once seizing his hand:\n“I have no intention to grieve or pain you—indeed, I have not.”\n\nMost bitterly he smiled—most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.\n“And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I\npresume?” said he, after a considerable pause.\n\n“Yes, I will, as your assistant,” I answered.\n\nA very long silence succeeded. What struggle there was in him between\nNature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams\nscintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face. He\nspoke at last.\n\n“I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age\nproposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine. I proved it to you\nin such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever\nagain alluding to the plan. That you have done so, I regret—for your\nsake.”\n\nI interrupted him. Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at\nonce. “Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense. You\npretend to be shocked by what I have said. You are not really shocked:\nfor, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so\nconceited as to misunderstand my meaning. I say again, I will be your\ncurate, if you like, but never your wife.”\n\nAgain he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion\nperfectly. He answered emphatically but calmly—\n\n“A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me. With me,\nthen, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I\nwill, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a\ncoadjutor. Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society’s\naid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your\npromise and deserting the band you engaged to join.”\n\nNow I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise\nor entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard\nand much too despotic for the occasion. I replied—\n\n“There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.\nI am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with\nstrangers. With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,\nconfide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go\nwhen and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate.”\n\n“Ah! you are afraid of yourself,” he said, curling his lip.\n\n“I am. God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish\nme would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.\nMoreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will\nknow for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it\nthan by leaving it.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on\nwhich I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by\nsome means that doubt is removed.”\n\n“I know where your heart turns and to what it clings. The interest you\ncherish is lawless and unconsecrated. Long since you ought to have\ncrushed it: now you should blush to allude to it. You think of Mr.\nRochester?”\n\nIt was true. I confessed it by silence.\n\n“Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?”\n\n“I must find out what is become of him.”\n\n“It remains for me, then,” he said, “to remember you in my prayers, and\nto entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed\nbecome a castaway. I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.\nBut God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done—”\n\nHe opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.\nHe was soon out of sight.\n\nOn re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window,\nlooking very thoughtful. Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put\nher hand on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.\n\n“Jane,” she said, “you are always agitated and pale now. I am sure\nthere is something the matter. Tell me what business St. John and you\nhave on hands. I have watched you this half hour from the window; you\nmust forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I\nhardly know what. St. John is a strange being—”\n\nShe paused—I did not speak: soon she resumed—\n\n“That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting\nyou, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest\nhe never showed to any one else—to what end? I wish he loved you—does\nhe, Jane?”\n\nI put her cool hand to my hot forehead; “No, Die, not one whit.”\n\n“Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so\nfrequently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?\nMary and I had both concluded he wished you to marry him.”\n\n“He does—he has asked me to be his wife.”\n\nDiana clapped her hands. “That is just what we hoped and thought! And\nyou will marry him, Jane, won’t you? And then he will stay in England.”\n\n“Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a\nfitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils.”\n\n“What! He wishes you to go to India?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Madness!” she exclaimed. “You would not live three months there, I am\ncertain. You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?”\n\n“I have refused to marry him—”\n\n“And have consequently displeased him?” she suggested.\n\n“Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany\nhim as his sister.”\n\n“It was frantic folly to do so, Jane. Think of the task you\nundertook—one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the\nstrong, and you are weak. St. John—you know him—would urge you to\nimpossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during\nthe hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts,\nyou force yourself to perform. I am astonished you found courage to\nrefuse his hand. You do not love him then, Jane?”\n\n“Not as a husband.”\n\n“Yet he is a handsome fellow.”\n\n“And I am so plain, you see, Die. We should never suit.”\n\n“Plain! You? Not at all. You are much too pretty, as well as too good,\nto be grilled alive in Calcutta.” And again she earnestly conjured me\nto give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.\n\n“I must indeed,” I said; “for when just now I repeated the offer of\nserving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of\ndecency. He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing\nto accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to\nfind in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such.”\n\n“What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?”\n\n“You should hear himself on the subject. He has again and again\nexplained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate. He\nhas told me I am formed for labour—not for love: which is true, no\ndoubt. But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that\nI am not formed for marriage. Would it not be strange, Die, to be\nchained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?”\n\n“Insupportable—unnatural—out of the question!”\n\n“And then,” I continued, “though I have only sisterly affection for him\nnow, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of\nconceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,\nbecause he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur\nin his look, manner, and conversation. In that case, my lot would\nbecome unspeakably wretched. He would not want me to love him; and if I\nshowed the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a\nsuperfluity, unrequired by him, unbecoming in me. I know he would.”\n\n“And yet St. John is a good man,” said Diana.\n\n“He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings\nand claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views. It is\nbetter, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest,\nin his progress, he should trample them down. Here he comes! I will\nleave you, Diana.” And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the\ngarden.\n\nBut I was forced to meet him again at supper. During that meal he\nappeared just as composed as usual. I had thought he would hardly speak\nto me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial\nscheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points. He addressed\nme precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his\nordinary manner—one scrupulously polite. No doubt he had invoked the\nhelp of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and\nnow believed he had forgiven me once more.\n\nFor the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first\nchapter of Revelation. It was at all times pleasant to listen while\nfrom his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice\nsound at once so sweet and full—never did his manner become so\nimpressive in its noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of\nGod: and to-night that voice took a more solemn tone—that manner a more\nthrilling meaning—as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the\nMay moon shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering\nalmost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat\nthere, bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page\nthe vision of the new heaven and the new earth—told how God would come\nto dwell with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes,\nand promised that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor\ncrying, nor any more pain, because the former things were passed away.\n\nThe succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially\nas I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in\nuttering them, his eye had turned on me.\n\n“He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God,\nand he shall be my son. But,” was slowly, distinctly read, “the\nfearful, the unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which\nburneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”\n\nHenceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.\n\nA calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his\nenunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter. The reader\nbelieved his name was already written in the Lamb’s book of life, and\nhe yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which\nthe kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need\nof sun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it,\nand the Lamb is the light thereof.\n\nIn the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered—all his\nstern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and\nresolved on a conquest. He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted;\nguidance for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh\nhour, for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were\nluring from the narrow path. He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of\na brand snatched from the burning. Earnestness is ever deeply solemn:\nfirst, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it\ncontinued and rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed. He felt the\ngreatness and goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard\nhim plead for it, could not but feel it too.\n\nThe prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early\nhour in the morning. Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room—in\ncompliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my\nhand, and wished him a pleasant journey.\n\n“Thank you, Jane. As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a\nfortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection. If I\nlistened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with\nme; but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim—to\ndo all things to the glory of God. My Master was long-suffering: so\nwill I be. I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:\nrepent—resolve, while there is yet time. Remember, we are bid to work\nwhile it is day—warned that ‘the night cometh when no man shall work.’\nRemember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life. God\ngive you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken\nfrom you!”\n\nHe laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words. He had spoken\nearnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding\nhis mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering\nsheep—or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is\nresponsible. All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;\nwhether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots—provided only they be\nsincere—have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule. I felt\nveneration for St. John—veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me\nat once to the point I had so long shunned. I was tempted to cease\nstruggling with him—to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf\nof his existence, and there lose my own. I was almost as hard beset by\nhim now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another. I\nwas a fool both times. To have yielded then would have been an error of\nprinciple; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment. So\nI think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet\nmedium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.\n\nI stood motionless under my hierophant’s touch. My refusals were\nforgotten—my fears overcome—my wrestlings paralysed. The\nImpossible—_i.e._, my marriage with St. John—was fast becoming the\nPossible. All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep. Religion\ncalled—Angels beckoned—God commanded—life rolled together like a\nscroll—death’s gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that\nfor safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.\nThe dim room was full of visions.\n\n“Could you decide now?” asked the missionary. The inquiry was put in\ngentle tones: he drew me to him as gently. Oh, that gentleness! how far\nmore potent is it than force! I could resist St. John’s wrath: I grew\npliant as a reed under his kindness. Yet I knew all the time, if I\nyielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my\nformer rebellion. His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn\nprayer: it was only elevated.\n\n“I could decide if I were but certain,” I answered: “were I but\nconvinced that it is God’s will I should marry you, I could vow to\nmarry you here and now—come afterwards what would!”\n\n“My prayers are heard!” ejaculated St. John. He pressed his hand firmer\non my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm,\n_almost_ as if he loved me (I say _almost_—I knew the difference—for I\nhad felt what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out\nof the question, and thought only of duty). I contended with my inward\ndimness of vision, before which clouds yet rolled. I sincerely, deeply,\nfervently longed to do what was right; and only that. “Show me, show me\nthe path!” I entreated of Heaven. I was excited more than I had ever\nbeen; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader\nshall judge.\n\nAll the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,\nwere now retired to rest. The one candle was dying out: the room was\nfull of moonlight. My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.\nSuddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it\nthrough, and passed at once to my head and extremities. The feeling was\nnot like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as\nstartling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto\nhad been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to\nwake. They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered\non my bones.\n\n“What have you heard? What do you see?” asked St. John. I saw nothing,\nbut I heard a voice somewhere cry—\n\n“Jane! Jane! Jane!”—nothing more.\n\n“O God! what is it?” I gasped.\n\nI might have said, “Where is it?” for it did not seem in the room—nor\nin the house—nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air—nor from\nunder the earth—nor from overhead. I had heard it—where, or whence, for\never impossible to know! And it was the voice of a human being—a known,\nloved, well-remembered voice—that of Edward Fairfax Rochester; and it\nspoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.\n\n“I am coming!” I cried. “Wait for me! Oh, I will come!” I flew to the\ndoor and looked into the passage: it was dark. I ran out into the\ngarden: it was void.\n\n“Where are you?” I exclaimed.\n\nThe hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back—“Where are\nyou?” I listened. The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland\nloneliness and midnight hush.\n\n“Down superstition!” I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the\nblack yew at the gate. “This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:\nit is the work of nature. She was roused, and did—no miracle—but her\nbest.”\n\nI broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me. It\nwas _my_ time to assume ascendency. _My_ powers were in play and in\nforce. I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave\nme: I must and would be alone. He obeyed at once. Where there is energy\nto command well enough, obedience never fails. I mounted to my chamber;\nlocked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way—a different\nway to St. John’s, but effective in its own fashion. I seemed to\npenetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in\ngratitude at His feet. I rose from the thanksgiving—took a resolve—and\nlay down, unscared, enlightened—eager but for the daylight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\nThe daylight came. I rose at dawn. I busied myself for an hour or two\nwith arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the\norder wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.\nMeantime, I heard St. John quit his room. He stopped at my door: I\nfeared he would knock—no, but a slip of paper was passed under the\ndoor. I took it up. It bore these words—\n\n“You left me too suddenly last night. Had you stayed but a little\nlonger, you would have laid your hand on the Christian’s cross and the\nangel’s crown. I shall expect your clear decision when I return this\nday fortnight. Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into\ntemptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is\nweak. I shall pray for you hourly.—Yours, ST. JOHN.”\n\n“My spirit,” I answered mentally, “is willing to do what is right; and\nmy flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven,\nwhen once that will is distinctly known to me. At any rate, it shall be\nstrong enough to search—inquire—to grope an outlet from this cloud of\ndoubt, and find the open day of certainty.”\n\nIt was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain\nbeat fast on my casement. I heard the front-door open, and St. John\npass out. Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden. He\ntook the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross—there\nhe would meet the coach.\n\n“In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin,”\nthought I: “I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross. I too have some to\nsee and ask after in England, before I depart for ever.”\n\nIt wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the interval in\nwalking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had\ngiven my plans their present bent. I recalled that inward sensation I\nhad experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable\nstrangeness. I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned\nwhence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_—not in the\nexternal world. I asked was it a mere nervous impression—a delusion? I\ncould not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration. The\nwondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the\nfoundations of Paul and Silas’s prison; it had opened the doors of the\nsoul’s cell and loosed its bands—it had wakened it out of its sleep,\nwhence it sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a\ncry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit,\nwhich neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the\nsuccess of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of\nthe cumbrous body.\n\n“Ere many days,” I said, as I terminated my musings, “I will know\nsomething of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me. Letters\nhave proved of no avail—personal inquiry shall replace them.”\n\nAt breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,\nand should be absent at least four days.\n\n“Alone, Jane?” they asked.\n\n“Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some\ntime been uneasy.”\n\nThey might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had\nbelieved me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had\noften said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained\nfrom comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well\nenough to travel. I looked very pale, she observed. I replied, that\nnothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.\n\nIt was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no\ninquiries—no surmises. Having once explained to them that I could not\nnow be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in\nthe silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of\nfree action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.\n\nI left Moor House at three o’clock P.M., and soon after four I stood at\nthe foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the\ncoach which was to take me to distant Thornfield. Amidst the silence of\nthose solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great\ndistance. It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted\none summer evening on this very spot—how desolate, and hopeless, and\nobjectless! It stopped as I beckoned. I entered—not now obliged to part\nwith my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation. Once more on\nthe road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.\n\nIt was a journey of six-and-thirty hours. I had set out from Whitcross\non a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning\nthe coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the\nmidst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral\nhills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern\nNorth-Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a\nonce familiar face. Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was\nsure we were near my bourne.\n\n“How far is Thornfield Hall from here?” I asked of the ostler.\n\n“Just two miles, ma’am, across the fields.”\n\n“My journey is closed,” I thought to myself. I got out of the coach,\ngave a box I had into the ostler’s charge, to be kept till I called for\nit; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the\nbrightening day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt\nletters, “The Rochester Arms.” My heart leapt up: I was already on my\nmaster’s very lands. It fell again: the thought struck it:—\n\n“Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you\nknow: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,\nwho besides him is there? His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do\nwith him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence. You have lost\nyour labour—you had better go no farther,” urged the monitor. “Ask\ninformation of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:\nthey can solve your doubts at once. Go up to that man, and inquire if\nMr. Rochester be at home.”\n\nThe suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on\nit. I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair. To prolong\ndoubt was to prolong hope. I might yet once more see the Hall under the\nray of her star. There was the stile before me—the very fields through\nwhich I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury\ntracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I\nwell knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of\nthem. How fast I walked! How I ran sometimes! How I looked forward to\ncatch the first view of the well-known woods! With what feelings I\nwelcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill\nbetween them!\n\nAt last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke\nthe morning stillness. Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.\nAnother field crossed—a lane threaded—and there were the courtyard\nwalls—the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid. “My\nfirst view of it shall be in front,” I determined, “where its bold\nbattlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single\nout my master’s very window: perhaps he will be standing at it—he rises\nearly: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in\nfront. Could I but see him!—but a moment! Surely, in that case, I\nshould not be so mad as to run to him? I cannot tell—I am not certain.\nAnd if I did—what then? God bless him! What then? Who would be hurt by\nmy once more tasting the life his glance can give me? I rave: perhaps\nat this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the\ntideless sea of the south.”\n\nI had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard—turned its angle:\nthere was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone\npillars crowned by stone balls. From behind one pillar I could peep\nround quietly at the full front of the mansion. I advanced my head with\nprecaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet\ndrawn up: battlements, windows, long front—all from this sheltered\nstation were at my command.\n\nThe crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.\nI wonder what they thought. They must have considered I was very\ncareful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and\nreckless. A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my\nniche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in\nfront of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.\n“What affectation of diffidence was this at first?” they might have\ndemanded; “what stupid regardlessness now?”\n\nHear an illustration, reader.\n\nA lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a\nglimpse of her fair face without waking her. He steals softly over the\ngrass, careful to make no sound; he pauses—fancying she has stirred: he\nwithdraws: not for worlds would he be seen. All is still: he again\nadvances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he\nlifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of\nbeauty—warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest. How hurried was their\nfirst glance! But how they fix! How he starts! How he suddenly and\nvehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since,\ntouch with his finger! How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden,\nand gazes on it wildly! He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he\nno longer fears to waken by any sound he can utter—by any movement he\ncan make. He thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone\ndead.\n\nI looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened\nruin.\n\nNo need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!—to peep up at chamber\nlattices, fearing life was astir behind them! No need to listen for\ndoors opening—to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk! The\nlawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void. The\nfront was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a shell-like wall,\nvery high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows:\nno roof, no battlements, no chimneys—all had crashed in.\n\nAnd there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome\nwild. No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never\nreceived an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church\naisle. The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had\nfallen—by conflagration: but how kindled? What story belonged to this\ndisaster? What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had\nfollowed upon it? Had life been wrecked as well as property? If so,\nwhose? Dreadful question: there was no one here to answer it—not even\ndumb sign, mute token.\n\nIn wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated\ninterior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late\noccurrence. Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void\narch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the\ndrenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and\nweed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters. And oh!\nwhere meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck? In what land? Under\nwhat auspices? My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower\nnear the gates, and I asked, “Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing\nthe shelter of his narrow marble house?”\n\nSome answer must be had to these questions. I could find it nowhere but\nat the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned. The host himself brought\nmy breakfast into the parlour. I requested him to shut the door and sit\ndown: I had some questions to ask him. But when he complied, I scarcely\nknew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers. And yet\nthe spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure\nfor a tale of misery. The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged\nman.\n\n“You know Thornfield Hall, of course?” I managed to say at last.\n\n“Yes, ma’am; I lived there once.”\n\n“Did you?” Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.\n\n“I was the late Mr. Rochester’s butler,” he added.\n\nThe late! I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been\ntrying to evade.\n\n“The late!” I gasped. “Is he dead?”\n\n“I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward’s father,” he explained. I\nbreathed again: my blood resumed its flow. Fully assured by these words\nthat Mr. Edward—_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he\nwas!)—was at least alive: was, in short, “the present gentleman.”\nGladdening words! It seemed I could hear all that was to come—whatever\nthe disclosures might be—with comparative tranquillity. Since he was\nnot in the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the\nAntipodes.\n\n“Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?” I asked, knowing, of\ncourse, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the\ndirect question as to where he really was.\n\n“No, ma’am—oh, no! No one is living there. I suppose you are a stranger\nin these parts, or you would have heard what happened last\nautumn,—Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about\nharvest-time. A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable\nproperty destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved. The\nfire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from\nMillcote, the building was one mass of flame. It was a terrible\nspectacle: I witnessed it myself.”\n\n“At dead of night!” I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality\nat Thornfield. “Was it known how it originated?” I demanded.\n\n“They guessed, ma’am: they guessed. Indeed, I should say it was\nascertained beyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware,” he continued,\nedging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, “that\nthere was a lady—a—a lunatic, kept in the house?”\n\n“I have heard something of it.”\n\n“She was kept in very close confinement, ma’am; people even for some\nyears was not absolutely certain of her existence. No one saw her: they\nonly knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what\nshe was it was difficult to conjecture. They said Mr. Edward had\nbrought her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.\nBut a queer thing happened a year since—a very queer thing.”\n\nI feared now to hear my own story. I endeavoured to recall him to the\nmain fact.\n\n“And this lady?”\n\n“This lady, ma’am,” he answered, “turned out to be Mr. Rochester’s\nwife! The discovery was brought about in the strangest way. There was a\nyoung lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in—”\n\n“But the fire,” I suggested.\n\n“I’m coming to that, ma’am—that Mr. Edward fell in love with. The\nservants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was\nafter her continually. They used to watch him—servants will, you know,\nma’am—and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him\nthought her so very handsome. She was a little small thing, they say,\nalmost like a child. I never saw her myself; but I’ve heard Leah, the\nhouse-maid, tell of her. Leah liked her well enough. Mr. Rochester was\nabout forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen\nof his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were\nbewitched. Well, he would marry her.”\n\n“You shall tell me this part of the story another time,” I said; “but\nnow I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.\nWas it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in\nit?”\n\n“You’ve hit it, ma’am: it’s quite certain that it was her, and nobody\nbut her, that set it going. She had a woman to take care of her called\nMrs. Poole—an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one\nfault—a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons—_she kept a\nprivate bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.\nIt is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was\ndangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water,\nthe mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of\nher pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the\nhouse, doing any wild mischief that came into her head. They say she\nhad nearly burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don’t know about\nthat. However, on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the\nroom next her own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made\nher way to the chamber that had been the governess’s—(she was like as\nif she knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at\nher)—and she kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in\nit, fortunately. The governess had run away two months before; and for\nall Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing\nhe had in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew\nsavage—quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but\nhe got dangerous after he lost her. He would be alone, too. He sent\nMrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but\nhe did it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and\nshe deserved it—she was a very good woman. Miss Adèle, a ward he had,\nwas put to school. He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and\nshut himself up like a hermit at the Hall.”\n\n“What! did he not leave England?”\n\n“Leave England? Bless you, no! He would not cross the door-stones of\nthe house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the\ngrounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses—which it is my\nopinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he\nwas before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma’am.\nHe was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and\nhe was not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his\nown, if ever man had. I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part,\nI have often wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she\ncame to Thornfield Hall.”\n\n“Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?”\n\n“Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning\nabove and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them\ndown himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell. And\nthen they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was\nstanding, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till\nthey could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own\neyes. She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it\nstreaming against the flames as she stood. I witnessed, and several\nmore witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the\nroof; we heard him call ‘Bertha!’ We saw him approach her; and then,\nma’am, she yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay\nsmashed on the pavement.”\n\n\nThe next minute she lay smashed on the pavement\n\n“Dead?”\n\n“Dead! Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were\nscattered.”\n\n“Good God!”\n\n“You may well say so, ma’am: it was frightful!”\n\nHe shuddered.\n\n“And afterwards?” I urged.\n\n“Well, ma’am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are\nonly some bits of walls standing now.”\n\n“Were any other lives lost?”\n\n“No—perhaps it would have been better if there had.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Poor Mr. Edward!” he ejaculated, “I little thought ever to have seen\nit! Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first\nmarriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one\nliving: but I pity him, for my part.”\n\n“You said he was alive?” I exclaimed.\n\n“Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead.”\n\n“Why? How?” My blood was again running cold. “Where is he?” I demanded.\n“Is he in England?”\n\n“Ay—ay—he’s in England; he can’t get out of England, I fancy—he’s a\nfixture now.”\n\nWhat agony was this! And the man seemed resolved to protract it.\n\n“He is stone-blind,” he said at last. “Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.\nEdward.”\n\nI had dreaded worse. I had dreaded he was mad. I summoned strength to\nask what had caused this calamity.\n\n“It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a\nway, ma’am: he wouldn’t leave the house till every one else was out\nbefore him. As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs.\nRochester had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great\ncrash—all fell. He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly\nhurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one\neye was knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the\nsurgeon, had to amputate it directly. The other eye inflamed: he lost\nthe sight of that also. He is now helpless, indeed—blind and a\ncripple.”\n\n“Where is he? Where does he now live?”\n\n“At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:\nquite a desolate spot.”\n\n“Who is with him?”\n\n“Old John and his wife: he would have none else. He is quite broken\ndown, they say.”\n\n“Have you any sort of conveyance?”\n\n“We have a chaise, ma’am, a very handsome chaise.”\n\n“Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to\nFerndean before dark this day, I’ll pay both you and him twice the hire\nyou usually demand.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\nThe manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,\nmoderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.\nI had heard of it before. Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and\nsometimes went there. His father had purchased the estate for the sake\nof the game covers. He would have let the house, but could find no\ntenant, in consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.\nFerndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception\nof some two or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the\nsquire when he went there in the season to shoot.\n\nTo this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the\ncharacteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating\nrain. The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise\nand driver with the double remuneration I had promised. Even when\nwithin a very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing\nof it, so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.\nIron gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and\npassing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of\nclose-ranked trees. There was a grass-grown track descending the forest\naisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches. I\nfollowed it, expecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on\nand on, it wound far and farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was\nvisible.\n\nI thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way. The darkness\nof natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me. I looked round\nin search of another road. There was none: all was interwoven stem,\ncolumnar trunk, dense summer foliage—no opening anywhere.\n\nI proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little;\npresently I beheld a railing, then the house—scarce, by this dim light,\ndistinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying\nwalls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a\nspace of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a\nsemicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad\ngravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of\nthe forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the\nwindows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one\nstep led up to it. The whole looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms\nhad said, “quite a desolate spot.” It was as still as a church on a\nweek-day: the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound\naudible in its vicinage.\n\n“Can there be life here?” I asked.\n\nYes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement—that narrow\nfront-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the\ngrange.\n\nIt opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the\nstep; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel\nwhether it rained. Dusk as it was, I had recognised him—it was my\nmaster, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.\n\nI stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him—to examine\nhim, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible. It was a sudden\nmeeting, and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain. I had\nno difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from\nhasty advance.\n\nHis form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port\nwas still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features\naltered or sunk: not in one year’s space, by any sorrow, could his\nathletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted. But in his\ncountenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding—that\nreminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous\nto approach in his sullen woe. The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes\ncruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.\n\nAnd, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?—if you\ndo, you little know me. A soft hope blent with my sorrow that soon I\nshould dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so\nsternly sealed beneath it: but not yet. I would not accost him yet.\n\nHe descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards\nthe grass-plat. Where was his daring stride now? Then he paused, as if\nhe knew not which way to turn. He lifted his hand and opened his\neyelids; gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and\ntoward the amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void\ndarkness. He stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one,\nhe kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an\nidea of what lay around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees\nwere some yards off where he stood. He relinquished the endeavour,\nfolded his arms, and stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast\non his uncovered head. At this moment John approached him from some\nquarter.\n\n“Will you take my arm, sir?” he said; “there is a heavy shower coming\non: had you not better go in?”\n\n“Let me alone,” was the answer.\n\nJohn withdrew without having observed me. Mr. Rochester now tried to\nwalk about: vainly,—all was too uncertain. He groped his way back to\nthe house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.\n\nI now drew near and knocked: John’s wife opened for me. “Mary,” I said,\n“how are you?”\n\nShe started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her. To her hurried\n“Is it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?”\nI answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the\nkitchen, where John now sat by a good fire. I explained to them, in few\nwords, that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield,\nand that I was come to see Mr. Rochester. I asked John to go down to\nthe turn-pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my\ntrunk, which I had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and\nshawl, I questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the\nManor House for the night; and finding that arrangements to that\neffect, though difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I\nshould stay. Just at this moment the parlour-bell rang.\n\n“When you go in,” said I, “tell your master that a person wishes to\nspeak to him, but do not give my name.”\n\n“I don’t think he will see you,” she answered; “he refuses everybody.”\n\nWhen she returned, I inquired what he had said.\n\n“You are to send in your name and your business,” she replied. She then\nproceeded to fill a glass with water, and place it on a tray, together\nwith candles.\n\n“Is that what he rang for?” I asked.\n\n“Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind.”\n\n“Give the tray to me; I will carry it in.”\n\nI took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door. The tray\nshook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my\nribs loud and fast. Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.\n\nThis parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in\nthe grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the\nhigh, old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.\nHis old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled\nup as if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon. Pilot pricked up\nhis ears when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and\nbounded towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands. I set it\non the table; then patted him, and said softly, “Lie down!” Mr.\nRochester turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as\nhe _saw_ nothing, he returned and sighed.\n\n“Give me the water, Mary,” he said.\n\nI approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed\nme, still excited.\n\n“What is the matter?” he inquired.\n\n“Down, Pilot!” I again said. He checked the water on its way to his\nlips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down. “This is\nyou, Mary, is it not?”\n\n“Mary is in the kitchen,” I answered.\n\nHe put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,\nhe did not touch me. “Who is this? Who is this?” he demanded, trying,\nas it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes—unavailing and\ndistressing attempt! “Answer me—speak again!” he ordered, imperiously\nand aloud.\n\n“Will you have a little more water, sir? I spilt half of what was in\nthe glass,” I said.\n\n“_Who_ is it? _What_ is it? Who speaks?”\n\n“Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here. I came only this\nevening,” I answered.\n\n“Great God!—what delusion has come over me? What sweet madness has\nseized me?”\n\n“No delusion—no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,\nyour health too sound for frenzy.”\n\n“And where is the speaker? Is it only a voice? Oh! I _cannot_ see, but\nI must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst. Whatever—whoever\nyou are—be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!”\n\nHe groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.\n\n“Her very fingers!” he cried; “her small, slight fingers! If so there\nmust be more of her.”\n\nThe muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my\nshoulder—neck—waist—I was entwined and gathered to him.\n\n“Is it Jane? _What_ is it? This is her shape—this is her size—”\n\n“And this her voice,” I added. “She is all here: her heart, too. God\nbless you, sir! I am glad to be so near you again.”\n\n“Jane Eyre!—Jane Eyre,” was all he said.\n\n“My dear master,” I answered, “I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out—I\nam come back to you.”\n\n“In truth?—in the flesh? My living Jane?”\n\n“You touch me, sir,—you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a\ncorpse, nor vacant like air, am I?”\n\n“My living darling! These are certainly her limbs, and these her\nfeatures; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery. It is a dream;\nsuch dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to\nmy heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus—and felt that she loved\nme, and trusted that she would not leave me.”\n\n“Which I never will, sir, from this day.”\n\n“Never will, says the vision? But I always woke and found it an empty\nmockery; and I was desolate and abandoned—my life dark, lonely,\nhopeless—my soul athirst and forbidden to drink—my heart famished and\nnever to be fed. Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will\nfly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before\nyou go—embrace me, Jane.”\n\n“There, sir—and there!”’\n\nI pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes—I swept\nhis hair from his brow, and kissed that too. He suddenly seemed to\narouse himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.\n\n“It is you—is it, Jane? You are come back to me then?”\n\n“I am.”\n\n“And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream? And you are\nnot a pining outcast amongst strangers?”\n\n“No, sir! I am an independent woman now.”\n\n“Independent! What do you mean, Jane?”\n\n“My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds.”\n\n“Ah! this is practical—this is real!” he cried: “I should never dream\nthat. Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and\npiquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life\ninto it.—What, Janet! Are you an independent woman? A rich woman?”\n\n“Quite rich, sir. If you won’t let me live with you, I can build a\nhouse of my own close up to your door, and you may come and sit in my\nparlour when you want company of an evening.”\n\n“But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will\nlook after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind\nlameter like me?”\n\n“I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own\nmistress.”\n\n“And you will stay with me?”\n\n“Certainly—unless you object. I will be your neighbour, your nurse,\nyour housekeeper. I find you lonely: I will be your companion—to read\nto you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes\nand hands to you. Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you\nshall not be left desolate, so long as I live.”\n\nHe replied not: he seemed serious—abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened\nhis lips as if to speak: he closed them again. I felt a little\nembarrassed. Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities;\nand he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness. I had\nindeed made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me\nto be his wife: an expectation, not the less certain because\nunexpressed, had buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his\nown. But no hint to that effect escaping him and his countenance\nbecoming more overcast, I suddenly remembered that I might have been\nall wrong, and was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and I began\ngently to withdraw myself from his arms—but he eagerly snatched me\ncloser.\n\n“No—no—Jane; you must not go. No—I have touched you, heard you, felt\nthe comfort of your presence—the sweetness of your consolation: I\ncannot give up these joys. I have little left in myself—I must have\nyou. The world may laugh—may call me absurd, selfish—but it does not\nsignify. My very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will\ntake deadly vengeance on its frame.”\n\n“Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so.”\n\n“Yes—but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand\nanother. You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and\nchair—to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an\naffectionate heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make\nsacrifices for those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no\ndoubt. I suppose I should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for\nyou: do you think so? Come—tell me.”\n\n“I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse,\nif you think it better.”\n\n“But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young—you must marry\none day.”\n\n“I don’t care about being married.”\n\n“You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make\nyou care—but—a sightless block!”\n\nHe relapsed again into gloom. I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,\nand took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where\nthe difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite\nrelieved from my previous embarrassment. I resumed a livelier vein of\nconversation.\n\n“It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you,” said I, parting his\nthick and long uncut locks; “for I see you are being metamorphosed into\na lion, or something of that sort. You have a ‘faux air’ of\nNebuchadnezzar in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair\nreminds me of eagles’ feathers; whether your nails are grown like\nbirds’ claws or not, I have not yet noticed.”\n\n“On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails,” he said, drawing the\nmutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me. “It is a mere\nstump—a ghastly sight! Don’t you think so, Jane?”\n\n“It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes—and the scar of\nfire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of\nloving you too well for all this; and making too much of you.”\n\n“I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my\ncicatrised visage.”\n\n“Did you? Don’t tell me so—lest I should say something disparaging to\nyour judgment. Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,\nand have the hearth swept up. Can you tell when there is a good fire?”\n\n“Yes; with the right eye I see a glow—a ruddy haze.”\n\n“And you see the candles?”\n\n“Very dimly—each is a luminous cloud.”\n\n“Can you see me?”\n\n“No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you.”\n\n“When do you take supper?”\n\n“I never take supper.”\n\n“But you shall have some to-night. I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,\nonly you forget.”\n\nSummoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared\nhim, likewise, a comfortable repast. My spirits were excited, and with\npleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time\nafter. There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and\nvivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I\nsuited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.\nDelightful consciousness! It brought to life and light my whole nature:\nin his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine. Blind as he\nwas, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his\nlineaments softened and warmed.\n\nAfter supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,\nwhat I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only\nvery partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that\nnight. Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord—to open no\nfresh well of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer\nhim. Cheered, as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits. If a\nmoment’s silence broke the conversation, he would turn restless, touch\nme, then say, “Jane.”\n\n“You are altogether a human being, Jane? You are certain of that?”\n\n\nYou are altogether a human being, Jane? You are certain of that?\n\n“I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester.”\n\n“Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise\non my lone hearth? I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a\nhireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting\nJohn’s wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear.”\n\n“Because I had come in, in Mary’s stead, with the tray.”\n\n“And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.\nWho can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for\nmonths past? Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;\nfeeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger\nwhen I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a\nvery delirium of desire to behold my Jane again. Yes: for her\nrestoration I longed, far more than for that of my lost sight. How can\nit be that Jane is with me, and says she loves me? Will she not depart\nas suddenly as she came? To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more.”\n\nA commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed\nideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this\nframe of mind. I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that\nthey were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make\nthem grow as broad and black as ever.\n\n“Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when,\nat some fatal moment, you will again desert me—passing like a shadow,\nwhither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards\nundiscoverable?”\n\n“Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?”\n\n“What for, Jane?”\n\n“Just to comb out this shaggy black mane. I find you rather alarming,\nwhen I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I\nam sure, you are more like a brownie.”\n\n“Am I hideous, Jane?”\n\n“Very, sir: you always were, you know.”\n\n“Humph! The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have\nsojourned.”\n\n“Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times\nbetter people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in\nyour life: quite more refined and exalted.”\n\n“Who the deuce have you been with?”\n\n“If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your\nhead; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my\nsubstantiality.”\n\n“Who have you been with, Jane?”\n\n“You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till\nto-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of\nsecurity that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it. By\nthe bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of\nwater then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried\nham.”\n\n“You mocking changeling—fairy-born and human-bred! You make me feel as\nI have not felt these twelve months. If Saul could have had you for his\nDavid, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the\nharp.”\n\n“There, sir, you are redd up and made decent. Now I’ll leave you: I\nhave been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.\nGood night.”\n\n“Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you\nhave been?”\n\nI laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs. “A good\nidea!” I thought with glee. “I see I have the means of fretting him out\nof his melancholy for some time to come.”\n\nVery early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from\none room to another. As soon as Mary came down I heard the question:\n“Is Miss Eyre here?” Then: “Which room did you put her into? Was it\ndry? Is she up? Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will\ncome down.”\n\nI came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.\nEntering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered\nmy presence. It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of\nthat vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity. He sat in his\nchair—still, but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now\nhabitual sadness marking his strong features. His countenance reminded\none of a lamp quenched, waiting to be re-lit—and alas! it was not\nhimself that could now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was\ndependent on another for that office! I had meant to be gay and\ncareless, but the powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to\nthe quick: still I accosted him with what vivacity I could.\n\n“It is a bright, sunny morning, sir,” I said. “The rain is over and\ngone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk\nsoon.”\n\nI had wakened the glow: his features beamed.\n\n“Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark! Come to me. You are not gone:\nnot vanished? I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over\nthe wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising\nsun had rays. All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane’s\ntongue to my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the\nsunshine I can feel is in her presence.”\n\nThe water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just\nas if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a\nsparrow to become its purveyor. But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed\noff the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.\n\nMost of the morning was spent in the open air. I led him out of the wet\nand wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how\nbrilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked\nrefreshed; how sparklingly blue was the sky. I sought a seat for him in\na hidden and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to\nlet him, when seated, place me on his knee. Why should I, when both he\nand I were happier near than apart? Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.\nHe broke out suddenly while clasping me in his arms—\n\n“Cruel, cruel deserter! Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you\nhad fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after\nexamining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor\nanything which could serve as an equivalent! A pearl necklace I had\ngiven you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left\ncorded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour. What\ncould my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless? And what\ndid she do? Let me hear now.”\n\nThus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year. I\nsoftened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and\nstarvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict\nunnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart\ndeeper than I wished.\n\nI should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making\nmy way: I should have told him my intention. I should have confided in\nhim: he would never have forced me to be his mistress. Violent as he\nhad seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too\ntenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half\nhis fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than\nI should have flung myself friendless on the wide world. I had endured,\nhe was certain, more than I had confessed to him.\n\n“Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short,” I\nanswered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at\nMoor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c. The\naccession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due\norder. Of course, St. John Rivers’ name came in frequently in the\nprogress of my tale. When I had done, that name was immediately taken\nup.\n\n“This St. John, then, is your cousin?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You have spoken of him often: do you like him?”\n\n“He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him.”\n\n“A good man. Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?\nOr what does it mean?”\n\n“St John was only twenty-nine, sir.”\n\n“‘_Jeune encore_,’ as the French say. Is he a person of low stature,\nphlegmatic, and plain. A person whose goodness consists rather in his\nguiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue.”\n\n“He is untiringly active. Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to\nperform.”\n\n“But his brain? That is probably rather soft? He means well: but you\nshrug your shoulders to hear him talk?”\n\n“He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point. His brain\nis first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous.”\n\n“Is he an able man, then?”\n\n“Truly able.”\n\n“A thoroughly educated man?”\n\n“St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar.”\n\n“His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?—priggish and\nparsonic?”\n\n“I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste,\nthey must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike.”\n\n“His appearance,—I forget what description you gave of his\nappearance;—a sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white\nneckcloth, and stilted up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?”\n\n“St. John dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue\neyes, and a Grecian profile.”\n\n(Aside.) “Damn him!”—(To me.) “Did you like him, Jane?”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before.”\n\nI perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor. Jealousy had got\nhold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him\nrespite from the gnawing fang of melancholy. I would not, therefore,\nimmediately charm the snake.\n\n“Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?”\nwas the next somewhat unexpected observation.\n\n“Why not, Mr. Rochester?”\n\n“The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too\noverwhelming contrast. Your words have delineated very prettily a\ngraceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,—tall, fair,\nblue-eyed, and with a Grecian profile. Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,—a\nreal blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the\nbargain.”\n\n“I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like\nVulcan, sir.”\n\n“Well, you can leave me, ma’am: but before you go” (and he retained me\nby a firmer grasp than ever), “you will be pleased just to answer me a\nquestion or two.” He paused.\n\n“What questions, Mr. Rochester?”\n\nThen followed this cross-examination.\n\n“St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his\ncousin?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You would often see him? He would visit the school sometimes?”\n\n“Daily.”\n\n“He would approve of your plans, Jane? I know they would be clever, for\nyou are a talented creature!”\n\n“He approved of them—yes.”\n\n“He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to\nfind? Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary.”\n\n“I don’t know about that.”\n\n“You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come\nthere to see you?”\n\n“Now and then?”\n\n“Of an evening?”\n\n“Once or twice.”\n\nA pause.\n\n“How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship\nwas discovered?”\n\n“Five months.”\n\n“Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?”\n\n“Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the\nwindow, and we by the table.”\n\n“Did he study much?”\n\n“A good deal.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Hindostanee.”\n\n“And what did you do meantime?”\n\n“I learnt German, at first.”\n\n“Did he teach you?”\n\n“He did not understand German.”\n\n“Did he teach you nothing?”\n\n“A little Hindostanee.”\n\n“Rivers taught you Hindostanee?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“And his sisters also?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Only you?”\n\n“Only me.”\n\n“Did you ask to learn?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“He wished to teach you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nA second pause.\n\n“Why did he wish it? Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?”\n\n“He intended me to go with him to India.”\n\n“Ah! here I reach the root of the matter. He wanted you to marry him?”\n\n“He asked me to marry him.”\n\n“That is a fiction—an impudent invention to vex me.”\n\n“I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than\nonce, and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be.”\n\n“Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me. How often am I to say the\nsame thing? Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I\nhave given you notice to quit?”\n\n“Because I am comfortable there.”\n\n“No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not\nwith me: it is with this cousin—this St. John. Oh, till this moment, I\nthought my little Jane was all mine! I had a belief she loved me even\nwhen she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter. Long as we\nhave been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never\nthought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another! But it\nis useless grieving. Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers.”\n\n“Shake me off, then, sir,—push me away, for I’ll not leave you of my\nown accord.”\n\n“Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds\nso truthful. When I hear it, it carries me back a year. I forget that\nyou have formed a new tie. But I am not a fool—go—”\n\n“Where must I go, sir?”\n\n“Your own way—with the husband you have chosen.”\n\n“Who is that?”\n\n“You know—this St. John Rivers.”\n\n“He is not my husband, nor ever will be. He does not love me: I do not\nlove him. He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a\nbeautiful young lady called Rosamond. He wanted to marry me only\nbecause he thought I should make a suitable missionary’s wife, which\nshe would not have done. He is good and great, but severe; and, for me,\ncold as an iceberg. He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his\nside, nor near him, nor with him. He has no indulgence for me—no\nfondness. He sees nothing attractive in me; not even youth—only a few\nuseful mental points.—Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?”\n\nI shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind\nbut beloved master. He smiled.\n\n“What, Jane! Is this true? Is such really the state of matters between\nyou and Rivers?”\n\n“Absolutely, sir! Oh, you need not be jealous! I wanted to tease you a\nlittle to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than\ngrief. But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I\n_do_ love you, you would be proud and content. All my heart is yours,\nsir: it belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to\nexile the rest of me from your presence for ever.”\n\nAgain, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.\n\n“My seared vision! My crippled strength!” he murmured regretfully.\n\nI caressed, in order to soothe him. I knew of what he was thinking, and\nwanted to speak for him, but dared not. As he turned aside his face a\nminute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle\ndown the manly cheek. My heart swelled.\n\n“I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in\nThornfield orchard,” he remarked ere long. “And what right would that\nruin have to bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?”\n\n“You are no ruin, sir—no lightning-struck tree: you are green and\nvigorous. Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or\nnot, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they\ngrow they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your\nstrength offers them so safe a prop.”\n\nAgain he smiled: I gave him comfort.\n\n“You speak of friends, Jane?” he asked.\n\n“Yes, of friends,” I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant\nmore than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ. He\nhelped me.\n\n“Ah! Jane. But I want a wife.”\n\n“Do you, sir?”\n\n“Yes: is it news to you?”\n\n“Of course: you said nothing about it before.”\n\n“Is it unwelcome news?”\n\n“That depends on circumstances, sir—on your choice.”\n\n“Which you shall make for me, Jane. I will abide by your decision.”\n\n“Choose then, sir—_her who loves you best_.”\n\n“I will at least choose—_her I love best_. Jane, will you marry me?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to\nwait on?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Truly, Jane?”\n\n“Most truly, sir.”\n\n“Oh! my darling! God bless you and reward you!”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life—if ever I thought\na good thought—if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer—if ever\nI wished a righteous wish,—I am rewarded now. To be your wife is, for\nme, to be as happy as I can be on earth.”\n\n“Because you delight in sacrifice.”\n\n“Sacrifice! What do I sacrifice? Famine for food, expectation for\ncontent. To be privileged to put my arms round what I value—to press my\nlips to what I love—to repose on what I trust: is that to make a\nsacrifice? If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice.”\n\n“And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies.”\n\n“Which are none, sir, to me. I love you better now, when I can really\nbe useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when\nyou disdained every part but that of the giver and protector.”\n\n“Hitherto I have hated to be helped—to be led: henceforth, I feel I\nshall hate it no more. I did not like to put my hand into a hireling’s,\nbut it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane’s little fingers. I\npreferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but\nJane’s soft ministry will be a perpetual joy. Jane suits me: do I suit\nher?”\n\n“To the finest fibre of my nature, sir.”\n\n“The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must\nbe married instantly.”\n\nHe looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.\n\n“We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the\nlicence to get—then we marry.”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its\nmeridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner. Let me look at\nyour watch.”\n\n“Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no\nuse for it.”\n\n“It is nearly four o’clock in the afternoon, sir. Don’t you feel\nhungry?”\n\n“The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane. Never mind fine\nclothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip.”\n\n“The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir. The breeze is still: it\nis quite hot.”\n\n“Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment\nfastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat? I have worn it since\nthe day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her.”\n\n“We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way.”\n\nHe pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.\n\n“Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells\nwith gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now. He sees\nnot as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far\nmore wisely. I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent\nflower—breathed guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from\nme. I, in my stiff-necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation:\ninstead of bending to the decree, I defied it. Divine justice pursued\nits course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass through\nthe valley of the shadow of death. _His_ chastisements are mighty; and\none smote me which has humbled me for ever. You know I was proud of my\nstrength: but what is it now, when I must give it over to foreign\nguidance, as a child does its weakness? Of late, Jane—only—only of\nlate—I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God in my doom. I began\nto experience remorse, repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my\nMaker. I began sometimes to pray: very brief prayers they were, but\nvery sincere.\n\n“Some days since: nay, I can number them—four; it was last Monday\nnight, a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced\nfrenzy—sorrow, sullenness. I had long had the impression that since I\ncould nowhere find you, you must be dead. Late that night—perhaps it\nmight be between eleven and twelve o’clock—ere I retired to my dreary\nrest, I supplicated God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon\nbe taken from this life, and admitted to that world to come, where\nthere was still hope of rejoining Jane.\n\n“I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it\nsoothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and\nonly by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon. I longed\nfor thee, Janet! Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh! I\nasked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long\nenough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss\nand peace once more. That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged—that\nI could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my\nheart’s wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words—‘Jane!\nJane! Jane!’”\n\n“Did you speak these words aloud?”\n\n“I did, Jane. If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me\nmad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy.”\n\n“And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?”\n\n“Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange\npoint. You will think me superstitious,—some superstition I have in my\nblood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true—true at least it is\nthat I heard what I now relate.\n\n“As I exclaimed ‘Jane! Jane! Jane!’ a voice—I cannot tell whence the\nvoice came, but I know whose voice it was—replied, ‘I am coming: wait\nfor me;’ and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the\nwords—‘Where are you?’\n\n“I’ll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to\nmy mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.\nFerndean is buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls\ndull, and dies unreverberating. ‘Where are you?’ seemed spoken amongst\nmountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words. Cooler and\nfresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have\ndeemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting. In\nspirit, I believe we must have met. You no doubt were, at that hour, in\nunconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to\ncomfort mine; for those were your accents—as certain as I live—they\nwere yours!”\n\nReader, it was on Monday night—near midnight—that I too had received\nthe mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to\nit. I listened to Mr. Rochester’s narrative, but made no disclosure in\nreturn. The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be\ncommunicated or discussed. If I told anything, my tale would be such as\nmust necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer:\nand that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not\nthe deeper shade of the supernatural. I kept these things then, and\npondered them in my heart.\n\n“You cannot now wonder,” continued my master, “that when you rose upon\nme so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any\nother than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to\nsilence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had\nmelted before. Now, I thank God! I know it to be otherwise. Yes, I\nthank God!”\n\nHe put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his\nbrow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute\ndevotion. Only the last words of the worship were audible.\n\n“I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered\nmercy. I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead\nhenceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!”\n\nThen he stretched his hand out to be led. I took that dear hand, held\nit a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so\nmuch lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide. We\nentered the wood, and wended homeward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII—CONCLUSION\n\n\nReader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and\nclerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I went into\nthe kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and\nJohn cleaning the knives, and I said—\n\n“Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning.” The\nhousekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order\nof people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable\npiece of news without incurring the danger of having one’s ears pierced\nby some shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of\nwordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle\nwith which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did\nfor some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of\ntime John’s knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary,\nbending again over the roast, said only—\n\n“Have you, Miss? Well, for sure!”\n\nA short time after she pursued—“I seed you go out with the master, but\nI didn’t know you were gone to church to be wed;” and she basted away.\nJohn, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.\n\n“I telled Mary how it would be,” he said: “I knew what Mr. Edward”\n(John was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the\ncadet of the house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)—“I\nknew what Mr. Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long\nneither: and he’s done right, for aught I know. I wish you joy, Miss!”\nand he politely pulled his forelock.\n\n“Thank you, John. Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this.” I\nput into his hand a five-pound note. Without waiting to hear more, I\nleft the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time after,\nI caught the words—\n\n“She’ll happen do better for him nor ony o’ t’ grand ladies.” And\nagain, “If she ben’t one o’ th’ handsomest, she’s noan faâl and varry\ngood-natured; and i’ his een she’s fair beautiful, onybody may see\nthat.”\n\nI wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had\ndone: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and Mary\napproved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she would just\ngive me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see\nme.\n\n“She had better not wait till then, Jane,” said Mr. Rochester, when I\nread her letter to him; “if she does, she will be too late, for our\nhoneymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your\ngrave or mine.”\n\nHow St. John received the news, I don’t know: he never answered the\nletter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,\nwithout, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester’s name or alluding to my\nmarriage. His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind. He\nhas maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever\nsince: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live\nwithout God in the world, and only mind earthly things.\n\nYou have not quite forgotten little Adèle, have you, reader? I had not;\nI soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at\nthe school where he had placed her. Her frantic joy at beholding me\nagain moved me much. She looked pale and thin: she said she was not\nhappy. I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its\ncourse of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with\nme. I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this\nimpracticable; my time and cares were now required by another—my\nhusband needed them all. So I sought out a school conducted on a more\nindulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often,\nand bringing her home sometimes. I took care she should never want for\nanything that could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her\nnew abode, became very happy there, and made fair progress in her\nstudies. As she grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great\nmeasure her French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a\npleasing and obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and\nwell-principled. By her grateful attention to me and mine, she has long\nsince well repaid any little kindness I ever had it in my power to\noffer her.\n\nMy tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of\nmarried life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names\nhave most frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.\n\nI have now been married ten years. I know what it is to live entirely\nfor and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely\nblest—blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband’s\nlife as fully as he is mine. No woman was ever nearer to her mate than\nI am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. I\nknow no weariness of my Edward’s society: he knows none of mine, any\nmore than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our\nseparate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together. To be together is\nfor us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company. We\ntalk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more\nanimated and an audible thinking. All my confidence is bestowed on him,\nall his confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in\ncharacter—perfect concord is the result.\n\nMr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps\nit was that circumstance that drew us so very near—that knit us so very\nclose: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.\nLiterally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye. He saw\nnature—he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his\nbehalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town,\nriver, cloud, sunbeam—of the landscape before us; of the weather round\nus—and impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp\non his eye. Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of\nconducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished\nto be done. And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most\nexquisite, even though sad—because he claimed these services without\npainful shame or damping humiliation. He loved me so truly, that he\nknew no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him\nso fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest\nwishes.\n\nOne morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to\nhis dictation, he came and bent over me, and said—“Jane, have you a\nglittering ornament round your neck?”\n\nI had a gold watch-chain: I answered “Yes.”\n\n“And have you a pale blue dress on?”\n\n\nAnd have you a pale blue dress on?\n\nI had. He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the\nobscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was\nsure of it.\n\nHe and I went up to London. He had the advice of an eminent oculist;\nand he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye. He cannot now\nsee very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his\nway without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to\nhim—the earth no longer a void. When his first-born was put into his\narms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they\nonce were—large, brilliant, and black. On that occasion, he again, with\na full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.\n\nMy Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we\nmost love are happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:\nalternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see\nthem. Diana’s husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a\ngood man. Mary’s is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother’s,\nand, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.\nBoth Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved\nby them.\n\nAs to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India. He entered on\nthe path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still. A more\nresolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.\nFirm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he\nlabours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he\nhews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber\nit. He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but\nhis is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim\nconvoy from the onslaught of Apollyon. His is the exaction of the\napostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says—“Whosoever will come\nafter me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.”\nHis is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a\nplace in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth—who\nstand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty\nvictories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.\n\nSt. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself has hitherto\nsufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious\nsun hastens to its setting. The last letter I received from him drew\nfrom my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he\nanticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown. I know that a\nstranger’s hand will write to me next, to say that the good and\nfaithful servant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord.\nAnd why weep for this? No fear of death will darken St. John’s last\nhour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope\nwill be sure, his faith steadfast. His own words are a pledge of this—\n\n“My Master,” he says, “has forewarned me. Daily He announces more\ndistinctly,—‘Surely I come quickly!’ and hourly I more eagerly\nrespond,—‘Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!’”`\n);\n\nexport const thePrince = new Book(\n  'The Prince',\n  `\nThe Prince\n\nby Nicolo Machiavelli\n\nTranslated by W.

Died at Florence on 22nd\nJune 1527._\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nNicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was the\nsecond son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute,\nand of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were\nmembers of the old Florentine nobility.\n\nHis life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly\nenough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history of\nFlorence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as an\nItalian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de’ Medici, Il Magnifico.\nThe downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year\nMachiavelli entered the public service. During his official career\nFlorence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted\nuntil 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his\noffice. The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they\nwere once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli’s\nliterary activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few\nweeks of the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his\nfifty-eighth year, without having regained office.\n\n\n\n\nYOUTH — Æt. 1-25—1469-94\n\n\nAlthough there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the\nFlorence of those days is so well known that the early environment of\nthis representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has been\ndescribed as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by\nthe fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving\nLorenzo. Savonarola’s influence upon the young Machiavelli must have\nbeen slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over the\nfortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of a\ngibe in _The Prince_, where he is cited as an example of an unarmed\nprophet who came to a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Medicean\nrule during the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli\nstrongly, for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to\nLorenzo’s grandson that he dedicates _The Prince_.\n\nMachiavelli, in his “History of Florence,” gives us a picture of the\nyoung men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: “They were freer\nthan their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other\nkinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming,\nand women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with\nwit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly\nwas thought the wisest.” In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli\nshows why youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and\nleads us to infer that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes:\n“I have received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure,\nespecially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than\nwhich I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and to\nme, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do your\nshare.” Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: “This will turn\nout well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then,\nyou have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters\nand music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I\nhave. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success\nand honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help\nyou if you help yourself.”\n\n\n\n\nOFFICE — Æt. 25-43—1494-1512\n\n\nThe second period of Machiavelli’s life was spent in the service of the\nfree Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from the\nexpulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512. After\nserving four years in one of the public offices he was appointed\nChancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty and\nPeace. Here we are on firm ground when dealing with the events of\nMachiavelli’s life, for during this time he took a leading part in the\naffairs of the Republic, and we have its decrees, records, and\ndispatches to guide us, as well as his own writings. A mere\nrecapitulation of a few of his transactions with the statesmen and\nsoldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his activities, and\nsupplies the sources from which he drew the experiences and characters\nwhich illustrate _The Prince_.\n\nHis first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, “my lady of Forli”\nof _The Prince_, from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it\nis far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on\nfortresses. This is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and is\nurged by him in many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes.\n\nIn 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII for\ncontinuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conduct\nof affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraft\nsummarized in _The Prince_, and was consequently driven out. He, also,\nit was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of support\nto Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge\nthat such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning the\nfaith of princes.\n\nMachiavelli’s public life was largely occupied with events arising out\nof the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the\nDuke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of _The\nPrince_. Machiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke\nfor the benefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have\nseized; he can, indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the\npattern of Cesare Borgia’s conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed\nby some critics as the “hero” of _The Prince_. Yet in _The Prince_ the\nduke is in point of fact cited as a type of the man who rises on the\nfortune of others, and falls with them; who takes every course that\nmight be expected from a prudent man but the course which will save\nhim; who is prepared for all eventualities but the one which happens;\nand who, when all his abilities fail to carry him through, exclaims\nthat it was not his fault, but an extraordinary and unforeseen\nfatality.\n\nOn the death of Pius III, in 1503, Machiavelli was sent to Rome to\nwatch the election of his successor, and there he saw Cesare Borgia\ncheated into allowing the choice of the College to fall on Giuliano\ndelle Rovere (Julius II), who was one of the cardinals that had most\nreason to fear the duke. Machiavelli, when commenting on this election,\nsays that he who thinks new favours will cause great personages to\nforget old injuries deceives himself. Julius did not rest until he had\nruined Cesare.\n\nIt was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that\npontiff was commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he brought\nto a successful issue, as he did many of his other adventures, owing\nchiefly to his impetuous character. It is in reference to Pope Julius\nthat Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and\nwomen, and concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man\nthat will win and hold them both.\n\nIt is impossible to follow here the varying fortunes of the Italian\nstates, which in 1507 were controlled by France, Spain, and Germany,\nwith results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with those\nevents, and with the three great actors in them, so far only as they\nimpinge on the personality of Machiavelli. He had several meetings with\nLouis XII of France, and his estimate of that monarch’s character has\nalready been alluded to. Machiavelli has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as\nthe man who accomplished great things under the cloak of religion, but\nwho in reality had no mercy, faith, humanity, or integrity; and who,\nhad he allowed himself to be influenced by such motives, would have\nbeen ruined. The Emperor Maximilian was one of the most interesting men\nof the age, and his character has been drawn by many hands; but\nMachiavelli, who was an envoy at his court in 1507-8, reveals the\nsecret of his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man,\nwithout force of character—ignoring the human agencies necessary to\ncarry his schemes into effect, and never insisting on the fulfilment of\nhis wishes.\n\nThe remaining years of Machiavelli’s official career were filled with\nevents arising out of the League of Cambrai, made in 1508 between the\nthree great European powers already mentioned and the pope, with the\nobject of crushing the Venetian Republic. This result was attained in\nthe battle of Vaila, when Venice lost in one day all that she had won\nin eight hundred years. Florence had a difficult part to play during\nthese events, complicated as they were by the feud which broke out\nbetween the pope and the French, because friendship with France had\ndictated the entire policy of the Republic. When, in 1511, Julius II\nfinally formed the Holy League against France, and with the assistance\nof the Swiss drove the French out of Italy, Florence lay at the mercy\nof the Pope, and had to submit to his terms, one of which was that the\nMedici should be restored. The return of the Medici to Florence on 1st\nSeptember 1512, and the consequent fall of the Republic, was the signal\nfor the dismissal of Machiavelli and his friends, and thus put an end\nto his public career, for, as we have seen, he died without regaining\noffice.\n\n\n\n\nLITERATURE AND DEATH — Æt. 43-58—1512-27\n\n\nOn the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks had\nvainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of Florence,\nwas dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512. Shortly after this he\nwas accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici,\nimprisoned, and put to the question by torture. The new Medicean pope,\nLeo X, procured his release, and he retired to his small property at\nSan Casciano, near Florence, where he devoted himself to literature. In\na letter to Francesco Vettori, dated 13th December 1513, he has left a\nvery interesting description of his life at this period, which\nelucidates his methods and his motives in writing _The Prince_. After\ndescribing his daily occupations with his family and neighbours, he\nwrites: “The evening being come, I return home and go to my study; at\nthe entrance I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt,\nand put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed I pass\ninto the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovingly\nreceived by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone; where I\ndo not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the reason of their\nactions, and they in their benignity answer me; and for four hours I\nfeel no weariness, I forget every trouble, poverty does not dismay,\ndeath does not terrify me; I am possessed entirely by those great men.\nAnd because Dante says:\n\nKnowledge doth come of learning well retained,\nUnfruitful else,\n\nI have noted down what I have gained from their conversation, and have\ncomposed a small work on ‘Principalities,’ where I pour myself out as\nfully as I can in meditation on the subject, discussing what a\nprincipality is, what kinds there are, how they can be acquired, how\nthey can be kept, why they are lost: and if any of my fancies ever\npleased you, this ought not to displease you: and to a prince,\nespecially to a new one, it should be welcome: therefore I dedicate it\nto his Magnificence Giuliano. Filippo Casavecchio has seen it; he will\nbe able to tell you what is in it, and of the discourses I have had\nwith him; nevertheless, I am still enriching and polishing it.”\n\nThe “little book” suffered many vicissitudes before attaining the form\nin which it has reached us. Various mental influences were at work\nduring its composition; its title and patron were changed; and for some\nunknown reason it was finally dedicated to Lorenzo de’ Medici. Although\nMachiavelli discussed with Casavecchio whether it should be sent or\npresented in person to the patron, there is no evidence that Lorenzo\never received or even read it: he certainly never gave Machiavelli any\nemployment. Although it was plagiarized during Machiavelli’s lifetime,\n_The Prince_ was never published by him, and its text is still\ndisputable.\n\nMachiavelli concludes his letter to Vettori thus: “And as to this\nlittle thing [his book], when it has been read it will be seen that\nduring the fifteen years I have given to the study of statecraft I have\nneither slept nor idled; and men ought ever to desire to be served by\none who has reaped experience at the expense of others. And of my\nloyalty none could doubt, because having always kept faith I could not\nnow learn how to break it; for he who has been faithful and honest, as\nI have, cannot change his nature; and my poverty is a witness to my\nhonesty.”\n\nBefore Machiavelli had got _The Prince_ off his hands he commenced his\n“Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius,” which should be read\nconcurrently with _The Prince_. These and several minor works occupied\nhim until the year 1518, when he accepted a small commission to look\nafter the affairs of some Florentine merchants at Genoa. In 1519 the\nMedicean rulers of Florence granted a few political concessions to her\ncitizens, and Machiavelli with others was consulted upon a new\nconstitution under which the Great Council was to be restored; but on\none pretext or another it was not promulgated.\n\nIn 1520 the Florentine merchants again had recourse to Machiavelli to\nsettle their difficulties with Lucca, but this year was chiefly\nremarkable for his re-entry into Florentine literary society, where he\nwas much sought after, and also for the production of his “Art of War.”\nIt was in the same year that he received a commission at the instance\nof Cardinal de’ Medici to write the “History of Florence,” a task which\noccupied him until 1525. His return to popular favour may have\ndetermined the Medici to give him this employment, for an old writer\nobserves that “an able statesman out of work, like a huge whale, will\nendeavour to overturn the ship unless he has an empty cask to play\nwith.”\n\nWhen the “History of Florence” was finished, Machiavelli took it to\nRome for presentation to his patron, Giuliano de’ Medici, who had in\nthe meanwhile become pope under the title of Clement VII. It is\nsomewhat remarkable that, as, in 1513, Machiavelli had written _The\nPrince_ for the instruction of the Medici after they had just regained\npower in Florence, so, in 1525, he dedicated the “History of Florence”\nto the head of the family when its ruin was now at hand. In that year\nthe battle of Pavia destroyed the French rule in Italy, and left\nFrancis I a prisoner in the hands of his great rival, Charles V. This\nwas followed by the sack of Rome, upon the news of which the popular\nparty at Florence threw off the yoke of the Medici, who were once more\nbanished.\n\nMachiavelli was absent from Florence at this time, but hastened his\nreturn, hoping to secure his former office of secretary to the “Ten of\nLiberty and Peace.” Unhappily he was taken ill soon after he reached\nFlorence, where he died on 22nd June 1527.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN AND HIS WORKS\n\n\nNo one can say where the bones of Machiavelli rest, but modern Florence\nhas decreed him a stately cenotaph in Santa Croce, by the side of her\nmost famous sons; recognizing that, whatever other nations may have\nfound in his works, Italy found in them the idea of her unity and the\ngerms of her renaissance among the nations of Europe. Whilst it is idle\nto protest against the world-wide and evil signification of his name,\nit may be pointed out that the harsh construction of his doctrine which\nthis sinister reputation implies was unknown to his own day, and that\nthe researches of recent times have enabled us to interpret him more\nreasonably. It is due to these inquiries that the shape of an “unholy\nnecromancer,” which so long haunted men’s vision, has begun to fade.\n\nMachiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness, and\nindustry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him, and\nwith his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforced\nretirement from affairs. He does not present himself, nor is he\ndepicted by his contemporaries, as a type of that rare combination, the\nsuccessful statesman and author, for he appears to have been only\nmoderately prosperous in his several embassies and political\nemployments. He was misled by Catherina Sforza, ignored by Louis XII,\noverawed by Cesare Borgia; several of his embassies were quite barren\nof results; his attempts to fortify Florence failed, and the soldiery\nthat he raised astonished everybody by their cowardice. In the conduct\nof his own affairs he was timid and time-serving; he dared not appear\nby the side of Soderini, to whom he owed so much, for fear of\ncompromising himself; his connection with the Medici was open to\nsuspicion, and Giuliano appears to have recognized his real forte when\nhe set him to write the “History of Florence,” rather than employ him\nin the state. And it is on the literary side of his character, and\nthere alone, that we find no weakness and no failure.\n\nAlthough the light of almost four centuries has been focused on _The\nPrince_, its problems are still debatable and interesting, because they\nare the eternal problems between the ruled and their rulers. Such as\nthey are, its ethics are those of Machiavelli’s contemporaries; yet\nthey cannot be said to be out of date so long as the governments of\nEurope rely on material rather than on moral forces. Its historical\nincidents and personages become interesting by reason of the uses which\nMachiavelli makes of them to illustrate his theories of government and\nconduct.\n\nLeaving out of consideration those maxims of state which still furnish\nsome European and eastern statesmen with principles of action, _The\nPrince_ is bestrewn with truths that can be proved at every turn. Men\nare still the dupes of their simplicity and greed, as they were in the\ndays of Alexander VI. The cloak of religion still conceals the vices\nwhich Machiavelli laid bare in the character of Ferdinand of Aragon.\nMen will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish them\nto be—and are ruined. In politics there are no perfectly safe courses;\nprudence consists in choosing the least dangerous ones. Then—to pass to\na higher plane—Machiavelli reiterates that, although crimes may win an\nempire, they do not win glory. Necessary wars are just wars, and the\narms of a nation are hallowed when it has no other resource but to\nfight.\n\nIt is the cry of a far later day than Machiavelli’s that government\nshould be elevated into a living moral force, capable of inspiring the\npeople with a just recognition of the fundamental principles of\nsociety; to this “high argument” _The Prince_ contributes but little.\nMachiavelli always refused to write either of men or of governments\notherwise than as he found them, and he writes with such skill and\ninsight that his work is of abiding value. But what invests _The\nPrince_ with more than a merely artistic or historical interest is the\nincontrovertible truth that it deals with the great principles which\nstill guide nations and rulers in their relationship with each other\nand their neighbours.\n\nIn translating _The Prince_ my aim has been to achieve at all costs an\nexact literal rendering of the original, rather than a fluent\nparaphrase adapted to the modern notions of style and expression.\nMachiavelli was no facile phrasemonger; the conditions under which he\nwrote obliged him to weigh every word; his themes were lofty, his\nsubstance grave, his manner nobly plain and serious. _Quis eo fuit\nunquam in partiundis rebus, in definiendis, in explanandis pressior?_\nIn _The Prince_, it may be truly said, there is reason assignable, not\nonly for every word, but for the position of every word. To an\nEnglishman of Shakespeare’s time the translation of such a treatise was\nin some ways a comparatively easy task, for in those times the genius\nof the English more nearly resembled that of the Italian language; to\nthe Englishman of to-day it is not so simple. To take a single example:\nthe word _intrattenere_, employed by Machiavelli to indicate the policy\nadopted by the Roman Senate towards the weaker states of Greece, would\nby an Elizabethan be correctly rendered “entertain,” and every\ncontemporary reader would understand what was meant by saying that\n“Rome _entertained_ the Ætolians and the Achaeans without augmenting\ntheir power.” But to-day such a phrase would seem obsolete and\nambiguous, if not unmeaning: we are compelled to say that “_Rome\nmaintained friendly relations with the Ætolians_,” etc., using four\nwords to do the work of one. I have tried to preserve the pithy brevity\nof the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolute fidelity to\nthe sense. If the result be an occasional asperity I can only hope that\nthe reader, in his eagerness to reach the author’s meaning, may\noverlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it.\n\nThe following is a list of the works of Machiavelli:\n\nPrincipal works.

And if your\nMagnificence from the summit of your greatness will sometimes turn your\neyes to these lower regions, you will see how unmeritedly I suffer a\ngreat and continued malignity of fortune.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PRINCE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\nHOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE, AND BY WHAT MEANS THEY ARE\nACQUIRED\n\n\nAll states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been\nand are either republics or principalities.\n\nPrincipalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long\nestablished; or they are new.\n\nThe new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or\nthey are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the\nprince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples to that of\nthe King of Spain.\n\nSuch dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a\nprince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of\nthe prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\nCONCERNING HEREDITARY PRINCIPALITIES\n\n\nI will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another\nplace I have written of them at length, and will address myself only to\nprincipalities. In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above,\nand discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.\n\nI say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary\nstates, and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than\nnew ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of\nhis ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise,\nfor a prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless\nhe be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if\nhe should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to\nthe usurper, he will regain it.\n\nWe have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have\nwithstood the attacks of the Venetians in ’84, nor those of Pope Julius\nin ’10, unless he had been long established in his dominions. For the\nhereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it\nhappens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices\ncause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects\nwill be naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and\nduration of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are\nlost, for one change always leaves the toothing for another.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\nCONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES\n\n\nBut the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be\nnot entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken\ncollectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from\nan inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for\nmen change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and\nthis hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein\nthey are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have\ngone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common\nnecessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have\nsubmitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships\nwhich he must put upon his new acquisition.\n\nIn this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in\nseizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends\nwho put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the\nway they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them,\nfeeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed\nforces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill\nof the natives.\n\nFor these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied\nMilan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it\nonly needed Lodovico’s own forces; because those who had opened the\ngates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future\nbenefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is\nvery true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time,\nthey are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with\nlittle reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the\ndelinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in\nthe weakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time\nit was enough for the Duke Lodovico[1] to raise insurrections on the\nborders; but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to\nbring the whole world against him, and that his armies should be\ndefeated and driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above\nmentioned.\n\n [1] Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco Sforza, who\n married Beatrice d’Este. He ruled over Milan from 1494 to 1500, and\n died in 1510.\n\nNevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second\ntime. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains\nto name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and\nwhat any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself\nmore securely in his acquisition than did the King of France.\n\nNow I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an\nancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country\nand language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold\nthem, especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government;\nand to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of\nthe prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in\nother things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will\nlive quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony,\nand Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and,\nalthough there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the\ncustoms are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst\nthemselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has\nonly to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of\ntheir former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws\nnor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will\nbecome entirely one body with the old principality.\n\nBut when states are acquired in a country differing in language,\ncustoms, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great\nenergy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real\nhelps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside\nthere. This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has\nmade that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other\nmeasures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled\nthere, would not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the\nspot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy\nthem; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are\ngreat, and then one can no longer remedy them. Besides this, the\ncountry is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied\nby prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have\nmore cause to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He\nwho would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost\ncaution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested\nfrom him with the greatest difficulty.\n\nThe other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places,\nwhich may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do\nthis or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A\nprince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense\nhe can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority\nonly of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them\nto the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and\nscattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being\nuninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not\nto err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have\nbeen despoiled. In conclusion, I say that these colonies are not\ncostly, they are more faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as\nhas been said, being poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one\nhas to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed,\nbecause they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious\nones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man\nought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.\n\nBut in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much\nmore, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state,\nso that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are\nexasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting\nof the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and\nall become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their\nown ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such\nguards are as useless as a colony is useful.\n\nAgain, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects\nought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful\nneighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care\nthat no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a\nfooting there; for it will always happen that such a one will be\nintroduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of\nambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were\nbrought into Greece by the Ætolians; and in every other country where\nthey obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And\nthe usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner\nenters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the\nhatred which they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to\nthose subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over\nto himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he\nhas acquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold\nof too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces,\nand with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of\nthem, so as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does\nnot properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired,\nand whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and\ntroubles.\n\nThe Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these\nmeasures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with[2]\nthe minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the\ngreater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.\nGreece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and\nÆtolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was\nhumbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and\nÆtolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor\ndid the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends\nwithout first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make\nthem agree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because\nthe Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do,\nwho have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for\nwhich they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it\nis easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the\nmedicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable;\nfor it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic\nfever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but\ndifficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either\ndetected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but\ndifficult to cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the\nevils that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise\nman to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not\nhaving been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that\nevery one can see them, there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the\nRomans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to\navoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war\nis not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of\nothers; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in\nGreece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided\nboth, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which\nis forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:—Let us enjoy the\nbenefits of the time—but rather the benefits of their own valour and\nprudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring\nwith it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.\n\n [2] See remark in the introduction on the word “intrattenere.”\n\nBut let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the\nthings mentioned. I will speak of Louis[3] (and not of Charles)[4] as\nthe one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held\npossession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he\nhas done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain\na state composed of divers elements.\n\n [3] Louis XII, King of France, “The Father of the People,” born 1462,\n died 1515.\n\n [4] Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.\n\nKing Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who\ndesired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention. I\nwill not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a\nfoothold in Italy, and having no friends there—seeing rather that every\ndoor was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles—he was forced to\naccept those friendships which he could get, and he would have\nsucceeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not\nmade some mistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy,\nregained at once the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded;\nthe Florentines became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of\nFerrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of\nPesaro, of Rimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans,\nthe Sienese—everybody made advances to him to become his friend. Then\ncould the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them,\nwhich, in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made\nthe king master of two-thirds of Italy.\n\nLet any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could\nhave maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above\nlaid down, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although\nthey were numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the\nChurch, some of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been\nforced to stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have\nmade himself secure against those who remained powerful. But he was no\nsooner in Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to\noccupy the Romagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was\nweakening himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had\nthrown themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by\nadding much temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater\nauthority. And having committed this prime error, he was obliged to\nfollow it up, so much so that, to put an end to the ambition of\nAlexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was\nhimself forced to come into Italy.\n\nAnd as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and\ndeprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples,\ndivided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter\nin Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country\nand the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and\nwhereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he\ndrove him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out\nin turn.\n\nThe wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always\ndo so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but\nwhen they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is\nfolly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with\nher own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she\nought not to have divided it. And if the partition which she made with\nthe Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she\ngot a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had\nnot the excuse of that necessity.\n\nTherefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers,\nhe increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he\nbrought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did\nnot send colonies. Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to\ninjure him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from\nthe Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought\nSpain into Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to\nhumble them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have\nconsented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have\nkept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would\nnever have consented except to become masters themselves there; also\nbecause the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order\nto give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not\nhave had the courage.\n\nAnd if any one should say: “King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander\nand the kingdom to Spain to avoid war,” I answer for the reasons given\nabove that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war,\nbecause it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your\ndisadvantage. And if another should allege the pledge which the king\nhad given to the Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in\nexchange for the dissolution of his marriage[5] and for the cap to\nRouen,[6] to that I reply what I shall write later on concerning the\nfaith of princes, and how it ought to be kept.\n\n [5] Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis XI, and\n married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles VIII, in order to\n retain the Duchy of Brittany for the crown.\n\n [6] The Archbishop of Rouen. He was Georges d’Amboise, created a\n cardinal by Alexander VI. Born 1460, died 1510.\n\nThus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the\nconditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and\nwished to retain them. Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that\nis reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I spoke at Nantes\nwith Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope\nAlexander, was usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal\nRouen observing to me that the Italians did not understand war, I\nreplied to him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning\nthat otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such\ngreatness. And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the\nChurch and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin\nmay be attributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which\nnever or rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming\npowerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about\neither by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him\nwho has been raised to power.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\nWHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER, DID NOT REBEL\nAGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH\n\n\nConsidering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly\nacquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander the Great\nbecame the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst it was\nscarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the whole\nempire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained\nthemselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose\namong themselves from their own ambitions.\n\nI answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to\nbe governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body of\nservants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his\nfavour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity\nby antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such barons\nhave states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and\nhold them in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a\nprince and his servants hold their prince in more consideration,\nbecause in all the country there is no one who is recognized as\nsuperior to him, and if they yield obedience to another they do it as\nto a minister and official, and they do not bear him any particular\naffection.\n\nThe examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the\nKing of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one\nlord, the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into\nsanjaks, he sends there different administrators, and shifts and\nchanges them as he chooses. But the King of France is placed in the\nmidst of an ancient body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects,\nand beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king\ntake these away except at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both\nof these states will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state\nof the Turk, but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The\ncauses of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that\nthe usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can\nhe hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the\nlord has around him. This arises from the reasons given above; for his\nministers, being all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with\ngreat difficulty, and one can expect little advantage from them when\nthey have been corrupted, as they cannot carry the people with them,\nfor the reasons assigned. Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in\nmind that he will find him united, and he will have to rely more on his\nown strength than on the revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has\nbeen conquered, and routed in the field in such a way that he cannot\nreplace his armies, there is nothing to fear but the family of this\nprince, and, this being exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the\nothers having no credit with the people; and as the conqueror did not\nrely on them before his victory, so he ought not to fear them after it.\n\nThe contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because\none can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom,\nfor one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change. Such men,\nfor the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the\nvictory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with\ninfinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from\nthose you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated\nthe family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves\nthe heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either\nto satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings\nthe opportunity.\n\nNow if you will consider what was the nature of the government of\nDarius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and\ntherefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him\nin the field, and then to take the country from him. After which\nvictory, Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander,\nfor the above reasons. And if his successors had been united they would\nhave enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults\nraised in the kingdom except those they provoked themselves.\n\nBut it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted\nlike that of France. Hence arose those frequent rebellions against the\nRomans in Spain, France, and Greece, owing to the many principalities\nthere were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them\nendured, the Romans always held an insecure possession; but with the\npower and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed\naway, and the Romans then became secure possessors. And when fighting\nafterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself\nhis own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumed\nthere; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none other\nthan the Romans were acknowledged.\n\nWhen these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with\nwhich Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties which\nothers have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more;\nthis is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the\nconqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\nCONCERNING THE WAY TO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH LIVED UNDER\nTHEIR OWN LAWS BEFORE THEY WERE ANNEXED\n\n\nWhenever those states which have been acquired as stated have been\naccustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom, there are three\ncourses for those who wish to hold them: the first is to ruin them, the\nnext is to reside there in person, the third is to permit them to live\nunder their own laws, drawing a tribute, and establishing within it an\noligarchy which will keep it friendly to you. Because such a\ngovernment, being created by the prince, knows that it cannot stand\nwithout his friendship and interest, and does its utmost to support\nhim; and therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will\nhold it more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other\nway.\n\nThere are, for example, the Spartans and the Romans. The Spartans held\nAthens and Thebes, establishing there an oligarchy: nevertheless they\nlost them. The Romans, in order to hold Capua, Carthage, and Numantia,\ndismantled them, and did not lose them. They wished to hold Greece as\nthe Spartans held it, making it free and permitting its laws, and did\nnot succeed. So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities\nin the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them\notherwise than by ruining them. And he who becomes master of a city\naccustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be\ndestroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of\nliberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither\ntime nor benefits will ever cause it to forget. And whatever you may do\nor provide against, they never forget that name or their privileges\nunless they are disunited or dispersed, but at every chance they\nimmediately rally to them, as Pisa after the hundred years she had been\nheld in bondage by the Florentines.\n\nBut when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, and\nhis family is exterminated, they, being on the one hand accustomed to\nobey and on the other hand not having the old prince, cannot agree in\nmaking one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern\nthemselves. For this reason they are very slow to take up arms, and a\nprince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily. But\nin republics there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire\nfor vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of\ntheir former liberty to rest; so that the safest way is to destroy them\nor to reside there.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\nCONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED BY ONE’S OWN ARMS AND\nABILITY\n\n\nLet no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalities\nas I shall do, I adduce the highest examples both of prince and of\nstate; because men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others,\nand following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely\nto the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate. A\nwise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to\nimitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not\nequal theirs, at least it will savour of it. Let him act like the\nclever archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far\ndistant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow\nattains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their\nstrength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid of\nso high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach.\n\nI say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is a\nnew prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them,\naccordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired\nthe state. Now, as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station\npresupposes either ability or fortune, it is clear that one or other of\nthese things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties.\nNevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is established the\nstrongest. Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no\nother state, is compelled to reside there in person.\n\nBut to come to those who, by their own ability and not through fortune,\nhave risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus,\nand such like are the most excellent examples. And although one may not\ndiscuss Moses, he having been a mere executor of the will of God, yet\nhe ought to be admired, if only for that favour which made him worthy\nto speak with God. But in considering Cyrus and others who have\nacquired or founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their\nparticular deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be\nfound inferior to those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor.\nAnd in examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed\nanything to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material\nto mould into the form which seemed best to them. Without that\nopportunity their powers of mind would have been extinguished, and\nwithout those powers the opportunity would have come in vain.\n\nIt was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of\nIsrael in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that\nthey should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of\nbondage. It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba, and\nthat he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should\nbecome King of Rome and founder of the fatherland. It was necessary\nthat Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the government of\nthe Medes, and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace.\nTheseus could not have shown his ability had he not found the Athenians\ndispersed. These opportunities, therefore, made those men fortunate,\nand their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity\nwhereby their country was ennobled and made famous.\n\nThose who by valorous ways become princes, like these men, acquire a\nprincipality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease. The\ndifficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules\nand methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their\ngovernment and its security. And it ought to be remembered that there\nis nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or\nmore uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the\nintroduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for\nenemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and\nlukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This\ncoolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on\ntheir side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily\nbelieve in new things until they have had a long experience of them.\nThus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the\nopportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others\ndefend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along\nwith them.\n\nIt is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter\nthoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves\nor have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate\ntheir enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force? In\nthe first instance they always succeed badly, and never compass\nanything; but when they can rely on themselves and use force, then they\nare rarely endangered. Hence it is that all armed prophets have\nconquered, and the unarmed ones have been destroyed. Besides the\nreasons mentioned, the nature of the people is variable, and whilst it\nis easy to persuade them, it is difficult to fix them in that\npersuasion. And thus it is necessary to take such measures that, when\nthey believe no longer, it may be possible to make them believe by\nforce.\n\nIf Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could not\nhave enforced their constitutions for long—as happened in our time to\nFra Girolamo Savonarola, who was ruined with his new order of things\nimmediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and he had no\nmeans of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the\nunbelievers to believe. Therefore such as these have great difficulties\nin consummating their enterprise, for all their dangers are in the\nascent, yet with ability they will overcome them; but when these are\novercome, and those who envied them their success are exterminated,\nthey will begin to be respected, and they will continue afterwards\npowerful, secure, honoured, and happy.\n\nTo these great examples I wish to add a lesser one; still it bears some\nresemblance to them, and I wish it to suffice me for all of a like\nkind: it is Hiero the Syracusan.[1] This man rose from a private\nstation to be Prince of Syracuse, nor did he, either, owe anything to\nfortune but opportunity; for the Syracusans, being oppressed, chose him\nfor their captain, afterwards he was rewarded by being made their\nprince. He was of so great ability, even as a private citizen, that one\nwho writes of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to be a king.\nThis man abolished the old soldiery, organized the new, gave up old\nalliances, made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers and allies, on\nsuch foundations he was able to build any edifice: thus, whilst he had\nendured much trouble in acquiring, he had but little in keeping.\n\n [1] Hiero II, born about 307 B.C., died 216 B.C.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\nCONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER BY THE ARMS OF\nOTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE\n\n\nThose who solely by good fortune become princes from being private\ncitizens have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they\nhave not any difficulties on the way up, because they fly, but they\nhave many when they reach the summit. Such are those to whom some state\nis given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it; as\nhappened to many in Greece, in the cities of Ionia and of the\nHellespont, where princes were made by Darius, in order that they might\nhold the cities both for his security and his glory; as also were those\nemperors who, by the corruption of the soldiers, from being citizens\ncame to empire. Such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the\nfortune of him who has elevated them—two most inconstant and unstable\nthings. Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position;\nbecause, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not\nreasonable to expect that they should know how to command, having\nalways lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it\nbecause they have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful.\n\nStates that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature\nwhich are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and\ncorrespondencies[1] fixed in such a way that the first storm will not\noverthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become\nprinces are men of so much ability that they know they have to be\nprepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps,\nand that those foundations, which others have laid _before_ they became\nprinces, they must lay _afterwards_.\n\n [1] “Le radici e corrispondenze,” their roots (i.e. foundations) and\n correspondencies or relations with other states—a common meaning of\n “correspondence” and “correspondency” in the sixteenth and seventeenth\n centuries.\n\nConcerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or\nfortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, and\nthese are Francesco Sforza[2] and Cesare Borgia. Francesco, by proper\nmeans and with great ability, from being a private person rose to be\nDuke of Milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand anxieties\nhe kept with little trouble. On the other hand, Cesare Borgia, called\nby the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy\nof his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he\nhad taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise\nand able man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms and\nfortunes of others had bestowed on him.\n\n [2] Francesco Sforza, born 1401, died 1466. He married Bianca Maria\n Visconti, a natural daughter of Filippo Visconti, the Duke of Milan,\n on whose death he procured his own elevation to the duchy. Machiavelli\n was the accredited agent of the Florentine Republic to Cesare Borgia\n (1478-1507) during the transactions which led up to the assassinations\n of the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, and along with his letters to\n his chiefs in Florence he has left an account, written ten years\n before _The Prince_, of the proceedings of the duke in his\n “Descritione del modo tenuto dal duca Valentino nello ammazzare\n Vitellozzo Vitelli,” etc., a translation of which is appended to the\n present work.\n\nBecause, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations\nmay be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be\nlaid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building. If,\ntherefore, all the steps taken by the duke be considered, it will be\nseen that he laid solid foundations for his future power, and I do not\nconsider it superfluous to discuss them, because I do not know what\nbetter precepts to give a new prince than the example of his actions;\nand if his dispositions were of no avail, that was not his fault, but\nthe extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune.\n\nAlexander the Sixth, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his son, had\nmany immediate and prospective difficulties. Firstly, he did not see\nhis way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the\nChurch; and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke\nof Milan and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and Rimini\nwere already under the protection of the Venetians. Besides this, he\nsaw the arms of Italy, especially those by which he might have been\nassisted, in hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope,\nnamely, the Orsini and the Colonnesi and their following. It behoved\nhim, therefore, to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers,\nso as to make himself securely master of part of their states. This was\neasy for him to do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other\nreasons, inclined to bring back the French into Italy; he would not\nonly not oppose this, but he would render it more easy by dissolving\nthe former marriage of King Louis. Therefore the king came into Italy\nwith the assistance of the Venetians and the consent of Alexander. He\nwas no sooner in Milan than the Pope had soldiers from him for the\nattempt on the Romagna, which yielded to him on the reputation of the\nking. The duke, therefore, having acquired the Romagna and beaten the\nColonnesi, while wishing to hold that and to advance further, was\nhindered by two things: the one, his forces did not appear loyal to\nhim, the other, the goodwill of France: that is to say, he feared that\nthe forces of the Orsini, which he was using, would not stand to him,\nthat not only might they hinder him from winning more, but might\nthemselves seize what he had won, and that the king might also do the\nsame. Of the Orsini he had a warning when, after taking Faenza and\nattacking Bologna, he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack. And\nas to the king, he learned his mind when he himself, after taking the\nDuchy of Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and the king made him desist from\nthat undertaking; hence the duke decided to depend no more upon the\narms and the luck of others.\n\nFor the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in\nRome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen,\nmaking them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to\ntheir rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that\nin a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned\nentirely to the duke. After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the\nOrsini, having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house. This came\nto him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length\nthat the aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them,\ncalled a meeting of the Magione in Perugia. From this sprung the\nrebellion at Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless\ndangers to the duke, all of which he overcame with the help of the\nFrench. Having restored his authority, not to leave it at risk by\ntrusting either to the French or other outside forces, he had recourse\nto his wiles, and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that, by the\nmediation of Signor Pagolo—whom the duke did not fail to secure with\nall kinds of attention, giving him money, apparel, and horses—the\nOrsini were reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his\npower at Sinigalia.[3] Having exterminated the leaders, and turned\ntheir partisans into his friends, the duke laid sufficiently good\nfoundations to his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of\nUrbino; and the people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity, he\ngained them all over to himself. And as this point is worthy of notice,\nand to be imitated by others, I am not willing to leave it out.\n\n [3] Sinigalia, 31st December 1502.\n\nWhen the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of weak\nmasters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and gave\nthem more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country was\nfull of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so, wishing\nto bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered it\nnecessary to give it a good governor. Thereupon he promoted Messer\nRamiro d’Orco,[4] a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the fullest\npower. This man in a short time restored peace and unity with the\ngreatest success. Afterwards the duke considered that it was not\nadvisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but\nthat he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the\ncountry, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had their\nadvocates. And because he knew that the past severity had caused some\nhatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the\npeople, and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if\nany cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in\nthe natural sternness of the minister. Under this pretence he took\nRamiro, and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the\npiazza at Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side. The\nbarbarity of this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied\nand dismayed.\n\n [4] Ramiro d’Orco. Ramiro de Lorqua.\n\nBut let us return whence we started. I say that the duke, finding\nhimself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate\ndangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a great\nmeasure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if\nhe wished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider France,\nfor he knew that the king, who too late was aware of his mistake, would\nnot support him. And from this time he began to seek new alliances and\nto temporize with France in the expedition which she was making towards\nthe kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were besieging Gaeta.\nIt was his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would\nhave quickly accomplished had Alexander lived.\n\nSuch was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the future\nhe had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church\nmight not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which\nAlexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, by\nexterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so as\nto take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by winning to\nhimself all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope\nwith their aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting the\ncollege more to himself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much power before\nthe Pope should die that he could by his own measures resist the first\nshock. Of these four things, at the death of Alexander, he had\naccomplished three. For he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords\nas he could lay hands on, and few had escaped; he had won over the\nRoman gentlemen, and he had the most numerous party in the college. And\nas to any fresh acquisition, he intended to become master of Tuscany,\nfor he already possessed Perugia and Piombino, and Pisa was under his\nprotection. And as he had no longer to study France (for the French\nwere already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by the Spaniards, and\nin this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill), he pounced down\nupon Pisa. After this, Lucca and Siena yielded at once, partly through\nhatred and partly through fear of the Florentines; and the Florentines\nwould have had no remedy had he continued to prosper, as he was\nprospering the year that Alexander died, for he had acquired so much\npower and reputation that he would have stood by himself, and no longer\nhave depended on the luck and the forces of others, but solely on his\nown power and ability.\n\nBut Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword. He\nleft the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated, with the\nrest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies, and sick\nunto death. Yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, and\nhe knew so well how men are to be won or lost, and so firm were the\nfoundations which in so short a time he had laid, that if he had not\nhad those armies on his back, or if he had been in good health, he\nwould have overcome all difficulties. And it is seen that his\nfoundations were good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a\nmonth. In Rome, although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst\nthe Baglioni, the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they\ncould not effect anything against him. If he could not have made Pope\nhim whom he wished, at least the one whom he did not wish would not\nhave been elected. But if he had been in sound health at the death of\nAlexander,[5] everything would have been different to him. On the day\nthat Julius the Second[6] was elected, he told me that he had thought\nof everything that might occur at the death of his father, and had\nprovided a remedy for all, except that he had never anticipated that,\nwhen the death did happen, he himself would be on the point to die.\n\n [5] Alexander VI died of fever, 18th August 1503.\n\n [6] Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of San Pietro ad\n Vincula, born 1443, died 1513.\n\nWhen all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to\nblame him, but rather it appears to be, as I have said, that I ought to\noffer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or the arms of\nothers, are raised to government. Because he, having a lofty spirit and\nfar-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise, and\nonly the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness\nfrustrated his designs. Therefore, he who considers it necessary to\nsecure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome\neither by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the\npeople, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate\nthose who have power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of\nthings for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to\ndestroy a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship\nwith kings and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal\nand offend with caution, cannot find a more lively example than the\nactions of this man.\n\nOnly can he be blamed for the election of Julius the Second, in whom he\nmade a bad choice, because, as is said, not being able to elect a Pope\nto his own mind, he could have hindered any other from being elected\nPope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of any\ncardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they\nbecame pontiffs. For men injure either from fear or hatred. Those whom\nhe had injured, amongst others, were San Pietro ad Vincula, Colonna,\nSan Giorgio, and Ascanio.[7] The rest, in becoming Pope, had to fear\nhim, Rouen and the Spaniards excepted; the latter from their\nrelationship and obligations, the former from his influence, the\nkingdom of France having relations with him. Therefore, above\neverything, the duke ought to have created a Spaniard Pope, and,\nfailing him, he ought to have consented to Rouen and not San Pietro ad\nVincula. He who believes that new benefits will cause great personages\nto forget old injuries is deceived. Therefore, the duke erred in his\nchoice, and it was the cause of his ultimate ruin.\n\n [7] San Giorgio is Raffaello Riario. Ascanio is Ascanio Sforza.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\nCONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY WICKEDNESS\n\n\nAlthough a prince may rise from a private station in two ways, neither\nof which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, yet it is\nmanifest to me that I must not be silent on them, although one could be\nmore copiously treated when I discuss republics. These methods are\nwhen, either by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends to the\nprincipality, or when by the favour of his fellow-citizens a private\nperson becomes the prince of his country. And speaking of the first\nmethod, it will be illustrated by two examples—one ancient, the other\nmodern—and without entering further into the subject, I consider these\ntwo examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them.\n\nAgathocles, the Sicilian,[1] became King of Syracuse not only from a\nprivate but from a low and abject position. This man, the son of a\npotter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous\nlife. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of\nmind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession,\nhe rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. Being established\nin that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself\nprince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that\nwhich had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding\nfor this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army,\nwas fighting in Sicily. One morning he assembled the people and the\nsenate of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating\nto the Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the\nsenators and the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held\nthe princedom of that city without any civil commotion. And although he\nwas twice routed by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not\nonly was he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for\nits defence, with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time\nraised the siege of Syracuse. The Carthaginians, reduced to extreme\nnecessity, were compelled to come to terms with Agathocles, and,\nleaving Sicily to him, had to be content with the possession of Africa.\n\n [1] Agathocles the Sicilian, born 361 B.C., died 289 B.C.\n\nTherefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will\nsee nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as\nhe attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any\none, but step by step in the military profession, which steps were\ngained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly\nheld by him with many hazardous dangers. Yet it cannot be called talent\nto slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith,\nwithout mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but not\nglory. Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and\nextricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his\ngreatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be\nseen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain.\nNevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite\nwickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent\nmen. What he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius.\n\nIn our times, during the rule of Alexander the Sixth, Oliverotto da\nFermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up by\nhis maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of his\nyouth sent to fight under Pagolo Vitelli, that, being trained under his\ndiscipline, he might attain some high position in the military\nprofession. After Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo,\nand in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous body\nand mind, he became the first man in his profession. But it appearing a\npaltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of some\ncitizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than\nits liberty, and with the help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo. So\nhe wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been away from home for many\nyears, he wished to visit him and his city, and in some measure to look\nupon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire\nanything except honour, yet, in order that the citizens should see he\nhad not spent his time in vain, he desired to come honourably, so would\nbe accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his friends and retainers; and\nhe entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably\nby the Fermians, all of which would be not only to his honour, but also\nto that of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up.\n\nGiovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew,\nand he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he\nlodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having\narranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a\nsolemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of\nFermo. When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual\nin such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave\ndiscourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son\nCesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and\nothers answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to\nbe discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a\nchamber, whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after\nhim. No sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places\nand slaughtered Giovanni and the rest. After these murders Oliverotto,\nmounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief\nmagistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to\nobey him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the\nprince. He killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and\nstrengthened himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a\nway that, in the year during which he held the principality, not only\nwas he secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all\nhis neighbours. And his destruction would have been as difficult as\nthat of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by\nCesare Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia,\nas was stated above. Thus one year after he had committed this\nparricide, he was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had made\nhis leader in valour and wickedness.\n\nSome may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after\ninfinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in his\ncountry, and defend himself from external enemies, and never be\nconspired against by his own citizens; seeing that many others, by\nmeans of cruelty, have never been able even in peaceful times to hold\nthe state, still less in the doubtful times of war. I believe that this\nfollows from severities[2] being badly or properly used. Those may be\ncalled properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are\napplied at one blow and are necessary to one’s security, and that are\nnot persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage\nof the subjects. The badly employed are those which, notwithstanding\nthey may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather than\ndecrease. Those who practise the first system are able, by aid of God\nor man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did. It is\nimpossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves.\n\n [2] Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the modern\n equivalent of Machiavelli’s thought when he speaks of “crudelta” than\n the more obvious “cruelties.”\n\nHence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought\nto examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for\nhim to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to\nrepeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to\nreassure them, and win them to himself by benefits. He who does\notherwise, either from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to\nkeep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor\ncan they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and\nrepeated wrongs. For injuries ought to be done all at one time, so\nthat, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given\nlittle by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer.\n\nAnd above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such\na way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall\nmake him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled\ntimes, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help\nyou, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be\nunder any obligation to you for them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\nCONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY\n\n\nBut coming to the other point—where a leading citizen becomes the\nprince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence,\nbut by the favour of his fellow citizens—this may be called a civil\nprincipality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain\nto it, but rather a happy shrewdness. I say then that such a\nprincipality is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the\nfavour of the nobles. Because in all cities these two distinct parties\nare found, and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be\nruled nor oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and\noppress the people; and from these two opposite desires there arises in\ncities one of three results, either a principality, self-government, or\nanarchy.\n\nA principality is created either by the people or by the nobles,\naccordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the\nnobles, seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the\nreputation of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that\nunder his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. The people,\nfinding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of\none of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his\nauthority. He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles\nmaintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the\naid of the people, because the former finds himself with many around\nhim who consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can\nneither rule nor manage them to his liking. But he who reaches\nsovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, and has none around\nhim, or few, who are not prepared to obey him.\n\nBesides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others,\nsatisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is\nmore righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress,\nwhile the former only desire not to be oppressed. It is to be added\nalso that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people,\nbecause of there being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure\nhimself, as they are few in number. The worst that a prince may expect\nfrom a hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile\nnobles he has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will\nrise against him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and\nastute, always come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain\nfavours from him whom they expect to prevail. Further, the prince is\ncompelled to live always with the same people, but he can do well\nwithout the same nobles, being able to make and unmake them daily, and\nto give or take away authority when it pleases him.\n\nTherefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought to\nbe looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape\ntheir course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or\nthey do not. Those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought\nto be honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt\nwith in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a\nnatural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them,\nespecially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst in\nprosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them.\nBut when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it\nis a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you,\nand a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they\nwere open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him.\n\nTherefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people\nought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only\nask not to be oppressed by him. But one who, in opposition to the\npeople, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above\neverything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may\neasily do if he takes them under his protection. Because men, when they\nreceive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound more\nclosely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more\ndevoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their\nfavours; and the prince can win their affections in many ways, but as\nthese vary according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules,\nso I omit them; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a prince to have the\npeople friendly, otherwise he has no security in adversity.\n\nNabis,[1] Prince of the Spartans, sustained the attack of all Greece,\nand of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his\ncountry and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it was\nonly necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this\nwould not have been sufficient had the people been hostile. And do not\nlet any one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that “He who\nbuilds on the people, builds on the mud,” for this is true when a\nprivate citizen makes a foundation there, and persuades himself that\nthe people will free him when he is oppressed by his enemies or by the\nmagistrates; wherein he would find himself very often deceived, as\nhappened to the Gracchi in Rome and to Messer Giorgio Scali[2] in\nFlorence. But granted a prince who has established himself as above,\nwho can command, and is a man of courage, undismayed in adversity, who\ndoes not fail in other qualifications, and who, by his resolution and\nenergy, keeps the whole people encouraged—such a one will never find\nhimself deceived in them, and it will be shown that he has laid his\nfoundations well.\n\n [1] Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, conquered by the Romans under Flamininus\n in 195 B.C.; killed 192 B.C.\n\n [2] Messer Giorgio Scali. This event is to be found in Machiavelli’s\n “Florentine History,” Book III.\n\nThese principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from\nthe civil to the absolute order of government, for such princes either\nrule personally or through magistrates. In the latter case their\ngovernment is weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on\nthe goodwill of those citizens who are raised to the magistracy, and\nwho, especially in troubled times, can destroy the government with\ngreat ease, either by intrigue or open defiance; and the prince has not\nthe chance amid tumults to exercise absolute authority, because the\ncitizens and subjects, accustomed to receive orders from magistrates,\nare not of a mind to obey him amid these confusions, and there will\nalways be in doubtful times a scarcity of men whom he can trust. For\nsuch a prince cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times, when\ncitizens have need of the state, because then every one agrees with\nhim; they all promise, and when death is far distant they all wish to\ndie for him; but in troubled times, when the state has need of its\ncitizens, then he finds but few. And so much the more is this\nexperiment dangerous, inasmuch as it can only be tried once. Therefore\na wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will\nalways in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state\nand of him, and then he will always find them faithful.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\nCONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO\nBE MEASURED\n\n\nIt is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of\nthese principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in\ncase of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether\nhe has always need of the assistance of others. And to make this quite\nclear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by\ntheir own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise\na sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack\nthem; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot\nshow themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to\ndefend themselves by sheltering behind walls. The first case has been\ndiscussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. In the second\ncase one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision\nand fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country.\nAnd whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the\nother concerns of his subjects in the way stated above, and to be often\nrepeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men are\nalways adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it\nwill be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town\nwell fortified, and is not hated by his people.\n\nThe cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country\naround them, and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits\nthem, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them,\nbecause they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the\ntaking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they\nhave proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they\nalways keep in public depots enough for one year’s eating, drinking,\nand firing. And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss\nto the state, they always have the means of giving work to the\ncommunity in those labours that are the life and strength of the city,\nand on the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold\nmilitary exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to\nuphold them.\n\nTherefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself\nodious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only\nbe driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this\nworld are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a\nwhole year in the field without being interfered with. And whoever\nshould reply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it\nburnt, they will not remain patient, and the long siege and\nself-interest will make them forget their prince; to this I answer that\na powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by\ngiving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for\nlong, at another time fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving\nhimself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.\n\nFurther, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin\nthe country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot\nand ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the\nprince to hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the\ndamage is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer\nany remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with\ntheir prince, he appearing to be under obligations to them now that\ntheir houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his\ndefence. For it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they\nconfer as much as by those they receive. Therefore, if everything is\nwell considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the\nminds of his citizens steadfast from first to last, when he does not\nfail to support and defend them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\nCONCERNING ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES\n\n\nIt only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching\nwhich all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they\nare acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held\nwithout either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of\nreligion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the\nprincipalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live.\nThese princes alone have states and do not defend them; and they have\nsubjects and do not rule them; and the states, although unguarded, are\nnot taken from them, and the subjects, although not ruled, do not care,\nand they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate\nthemselves. Such principalities only are secure and happy. But being\nupheld by powers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I shall speak\nno more of them, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would\nbe the act of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them.\n\nNevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the Church\nhas attained such greatness in temporal power, seeing that from\nAlexander backwards the Italian potentates (not only those who have\nbeen called potentates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest)\nhave valued the temporal power very slightly—yet now a king of France\ntrembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, and\nto ruin the Venetians—although this may be very manifest, it does not\nappear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory.\n\nBefore Charles, King of France, passed into Italy,[1] this country was\nunder the dominion of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the\nDuke of Milan, and the Florentines. These potentates had two principal\nanxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms;\nthe other, that none of themselves should seize more territory. Those\nabout whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians.\nTo restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as\nit was for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made\nuse of the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini\nand Colonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with\narms in their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate\nweak and powerless. And although there might arise sometimes a\ncourageous pope, such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could\nrid him of these annoyances. And the short life of a pope is also a\ncause of weakness; for in the ten years, which is the average life of a\npope, he can with difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to\nspeak, one people should almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would\narise hostile to the Orsini, who would support their opponents, and yet\nwould not have time to ruin the Orsini. This was the reason why the\ntemporal powers of the pope were little esteemed in Italy.\n\n [1] Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494.\n\nAlexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that have\never been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to\nprevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by\nreason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things\nwhich I have discussed above in the actions of the duke. And although\nhis intention was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke,\nnevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the Church,\nwhich, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all\nhis labours.\n\nPope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, possessing all\nthe Romagna, the barons of Rome reduced to impotence, and, through the\nchastisements of Alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found the\nway open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been\npractised before Alexander’s time. Such things Julius not only\nfollowed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin\nthe Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these\nenterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit,\ninasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any\nprivate person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within\nthe bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them\nsome mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm:\nthe one, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and\nthe other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused\nthe disorders among them. For whenever these factions have their\ncardinals they do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster\nthe factions in Rome and out of it, and the barons are compelled to\nsupport them, and thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders\nand tumults among the barons. For these reasons his Holiness Pope\nLeo[2] found the pontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that,\nif others made it great in arms, he will make it still greater and more\nvenerated by his goodness and infinite other virtues.\n\n [2] Pope Leo X was the Cardinal de’ Medici.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\nHOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE, AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES\n\n\nHaving discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such\nprincipalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having\nconsidered in some degree the causes of there being good or bad, and\nhaving shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and\nto hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of\noffence and defence which belong to each of them.\n\nWe have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his\nfoundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to\nruin. The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or\ncomposite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good\nlaws where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are\nwell armed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the\ndiscussion and shall speak of the arms.\n\nI say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state\nare either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed.\nMercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds\nhis state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for\nthey are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful,\nvaliant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the\nfear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so\nlong as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war\nby the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for\nkeeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to\nmake them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be your\nsoldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take\nthemselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble\nto prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by\nresting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they\nformerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet\nwhen the foreigners came they showed what they were. Thus it was that\nCharles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in\nhand;[1] and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the\ntruth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have\nrelated. And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who\nhave also suffered the penalty.\n\n [1] “With chalk in hand,” “col gesso.” This is one of the _bons mots_\n of Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with which Charles VIII seized\n Italy, implying that it was only necessary for him to send his\n quartermasters to chalk up the billets for his soldiers to conquer the\n country. _Cf_. “The History of Henry VII,” by Lord Bacon: “King\n Charles had conquered the realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a\n kind of a felicity of a dream. He passed the whole length of Italy\n without resistance: so that it was true what Pope Alexander was wont\n to say: That the Frenchmen came into Italy with chalk in their hands,\n to mark up their lodgings, rather than with swords to fight.”\n\nI wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The\nmercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they are,\nyou cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own\ngreatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others\ncontrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are\nruined in the usual way.\n\nAnd if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way,\nwhether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted\nto, either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in\nperson and perform the duty of a captain; the republic has to send its\ncitizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it\nought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws so\nthat he does not leave the command. And experience has shown princes\nand republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and\nmercenaries doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to\nbring a republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its\ncitizens than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms. Rome and\nSparta stood for many ages armed and free. The Switzers are completely\narmed and quite free.\n\nOf ancient mercenaries, for example, there are the Carthaginians, who\nwere oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with the\nRomans, although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for captains.\nAfter the death of Epaminondas, Philip of Macedon was made captain of\ntheir soldiers by the Thebans, and after victory he took away their\nliberty.\n\nDuke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against\nthe Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio,[2]\nallied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters. His\nfather, Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna[3] of Naples, left\nher unprotected, so that she was forced to throw herself into the arms\nof the King of Aragon, in order to save her kingdom. And if the\nVenetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these\narms, and yet their captains did not make themselves princes, but have\ndefended them, I reply that the Florentines in this case have been\nfavoured by chance, for of the able captains, of whom they might have\nstood in fear, some have not conquered, some have been opposed, and\nothers have turned their ambitions elsewhere. One who did not conquer\nwas Giovanni Acuto,[4] and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot\nbe proved; but every one will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the\nFlorentines would have stood at his discretion. Sforza had the\nBracceschi always against him, so they watched each other. Francesco\nturned his ambition to Lombardy; Braccio against the Church and the\nkingdom of Naples. But let us come to that which happened a short while\nago. The Florentines appointed as their captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most\nprudent man, who from a private position had risen to the greatest\nrenown. If this man had taken Pisa, nobody can deny that it would have\nbeen proper for the Florentines to keep in with him, for if he became\nthe soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting, and if\nthey held to him they must obey him. The Venetians, if their\nachievements are considered, will be seen to have acted safely and\ngloriously so long as they sent to war their own men, when with armed\ngentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. This was before they turned\nto enterprises on land, but when they began to fight on land they\nforsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy. And in the\nbeginning of their expansion on land, through not having much\nterritory, and because of their great reputation, they had not much to\nfear from their captains; but when they expanded, as under\nCarmignuola,[5] they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him\na most valiant man (they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership),\nand, on the other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they\nfeared they would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason they\nwere not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to\nlose again that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order\nto secure themselves, to murder him. They had afterwards for their\ncaptains Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino, the count of\nPitigliano,[6] and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not\ngain, as happened afterwards at Vaila,[7] where in one battle they lost\nthat which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much\ntrouble. Because from such arms conquests come but slowly, long delayed\nand inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous.\n\n [2] Battle of Caravaggio, 15th September 1448.\n\n [3] Johanna II of Naples, the widow of Ladislao, King of Naples.\n\n [4] Giovanni Acuto. An English knight whose name was Sir John\n Hawkwood. He fought in the English wars in France, and was knighted by\n Edward III; afterwards he collected a body of troops and went into\n Italy. These became the famous “White Company.” He took part in many\n wars, and died in Florence in 1394. He was born about 1320 at Sible\n Hedingham, a village in Essex. He married Domnia, a daughter of\n Bernabo Visconti.\n\n [5] Carmignuola. Francesco Bussone, born at Carmagnola about 1390,\n executed at Venice, 5th May 1432.\n\n [6] Bartolomeo Colleoni of Bergamo; died 1457. Roberto of San\n Severino; died fighting for Venice against Sigismund, Duke of Austria,\n in 1487. “Primo capitano in Italia.”—Machiavelli. Count of Pitigliano;\n Nicolo Orsini, born 1442, died 1510.\n\n [7] Battle of Vaila in 1509.\n\nAnd as with these examples I have reached Italy, which has been ruled\nfor many years by mercenaries, I wish to discuss them more seriously,\nin order that, having seen their rise and progress, one may be better\nprepared to counteract them. You must understand that the empire has\nrecently come to be repudiated in Italy, that the Pope has acquired\nmore temporal power, and that Italy has been divided up into more\nstates, for the reason that many of the great cities took up arms\nagainst their nobles, who, formerly favoured by the emperor, were\noppressing them, whilst the Church was favouring them so as to gain\nauthority in temporal power: in many others their citizens became\nprinces. From this it came to pass that Italy fell partly into the\nhands of the Church and of republics, and, the Church consisting of\npriests and the republic of citizens unaccustomed to arms, both\ncommenced to enlist foreigners.\n\nThe first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio,[8]\nthe Romagnian. From the school of this man sprang, among others,\nBraccio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy. After\nthese came all the other captains who till now have directed the arms\nof Italy; and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been\noverrun by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted\nby the Switzers. The principle that has guided them has been, first, to\nlower the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own.\nThey did this because, subsisting on their pay and without territory,\nthey were unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not\ngive them any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a\nmoderate force of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs\nwere brought to such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand\nsoldiers, there were not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. They\nhad, besides this, used every art to lessen fatigue and danger to\nthemselves and their soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking\nprisoners and liberating without ransom. They did not attack towns at\nnight, nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at night;\nthey did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did\nthey campaign in the winter. All these things were permitted by their\nmilitary rules, and devised by them to avoid, as I have said, both\nfatigue and dangers; thus they have brought Italy to slavery and\ncontempt.\n\n [8] Alberigo da Conio. Alberico da Barbiano, Count of Cunio in\n Romagna. He was the leader of the famous “Company of St George,”\n composed entirely of Italian soldiers. He died in 1409.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\nCONCERNING AUXILIARIES, MIXED SOLDIERY, AND ONE’S OWN\n\n\nAuxiliaries, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a\nprince is called in with his forces to aid and defend, as was done by\nPope Julius in the most recent times; for he, having, in the enterprise\nagainst Ferrara, had poor proof of his mercenaries, turned to\nauxiliaries, and stipulated with Ferdinand, King of Spain,[1] for his\nassistance with men and arms. These arms may be useful and good in\nthemselves, but for him who calls them in they are always\ndisadvantageous; for losing, one is undone, and winning, one is their\ncaptive.\n\n [1] Ferdinand V (F. II of Aragon and Sicily, F. III of Naples),\n surnamed “The Catholic,” born 1452, died 1516.\n\nAnd although ancient histories may be full of examples, I do not wish\nto leave this recent one of Pope Julius the Second, the peril of which\ncannot fail to be perceived; for he, wishing to get Ferrara, threw\nhimself entirely into the hands of the foreigner. But his good fortune\nbrought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his\nrash choice; because, having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and the\nSwitzers having risen and driven out the conquerors (against all\nexpectation, both his and others), it so came to pass that he did not\nbecome prisoner to his enemies, they having fled, nor to his\nauxiliaries, he having conquered by other arms than theirs.\n\nThe Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand\nFrenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other\ntime of their troubles.\n\nThe Emperor of Constantinople,[2] to oppose his neighbours, sent ten\nthousand Turks into Greece, who, on the war being finished, were not\nwilling to quit; this was the beginning of the servitude of Greece to\nthe infidels.\n\n [2] Joannes Cantacuzenus, born 1300, died 1383.\n\nTherefore, let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these arms,\nfor they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because with them\nthe ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield obedience to\nothers; but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more time and\nbetter opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of one\ncommunity, they are found and paid by you, and a third party, which you\nhave made their head, is not able all at once to assume enough\nauthority to injure you. In conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy is most\ndangerous; in auxiliaries, valour. The wise prince, therefore, has\nalways avoided these arms and turned to his own; and has been willing\nrather to lose with them than to conquer with the others, not deeming\nthat a real victory which is gained with the arms of others.\n\nI shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions. This duke\nentered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French\nsoldiers, and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards,\nsuch forces not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries,\ndiscerning less danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli;\nwhom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and\ndangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own men. And the difference\nbetween one and the other of these forces can easily be seen when one\nconsiders the difference there was in the reputation of the duke, when\nhe had the French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli, and when he\nrelied on his own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and\nfound it ever increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when\nevery one saw that he was complete master of his own forces.\n\nI was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but I am\nunwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those I\nhave named above. This man, as I have said, made head of the army by\nthe Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, constituted\nlike our Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him\nthat he could neither keep them not let them go, he had them all cut to\npieces, and afterwards made war with his own forces and not with\naliens.\n\nI wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament\napplicable to this subject. David offered himself to Saul to fight with\nGoliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, Saul armed\nhim with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as he had them\non his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he wished to\nmeet the enemy with his sling and his knife. In conclusion, the arms of\nothers either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind\nyou fast.\n\nCharles the Seventh,[3] the father of King Louis the Eleventh,[4]\nhaving by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English,\nrecognized the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he\nestablished in his kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and\ninfantry. Afterwards his son, King Louis, abolished the infantry and\nbegan to enlist the Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as\nis now seen, a source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised\nthe reputation of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of\nhis own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his\nmen-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so\naccustomed to fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that they\ncan now conquer without them. Hence it arises that the French cannot\nstand against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come\noff well against others. The armies of the French have thus become\nmixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms\ntogether are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone,\nbut much inferior to one’s own forces. And this example proves it, for\nthe kingdom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of\nCharles had been enlarged or maintained.\n\n [3] Charles VII of France, surnamed “The Victorious,” born 1403, died\n 1461.\n\n [4] Louis XI, son of the above, born 1423, died 1483.\n\nBut the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks\nwell at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I\nhave said above of hectic fevers. Therefore, if he who rules a\nprincipality cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not\ntruly wise; and this insight is given to few. And if the first disaster\nto the Roman Empire[5] should be examined, it will be found to have\ncommenced only with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that time\nthe vigour of the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that valour\nwhich had raised it passed away to others.\n\n [5] “Many speakers to the House the other night in the debate on the\n reduction of armaments seemed to show a most lamentable ignorance of\n the conditions under which the British Empire maintains its existence.\n When Mr Balfour replied to the allegations that the Roman Empire sank\n under the weight of its military obligations, he said that this was\n ‘wholly unhistorical.’ He might well have added that the Roman power\n was at its zenith when every citizen acknowledged his liability to\n fight for the State, but that it began to decline as soon as this\n obligation was no longer recognised.”—_Pall Mall Gazette_, 15th May\n 1906.\n\nI conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having\nits own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good\nfortune, not having the valour which in adversity would defend it. And\nit has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing\ncan be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own\nstrength. And one’s own forces are those which are composed either of\nsubjects, citizens, or dependents; all others are mercenaries or\nauxiliaries. And the way to make ready one’s own forces will be easily\nfound if the rules suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and if one\nwill consider how Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, and many\nrepublics and princes have armed and organized themselves, to which\nrules I entirely commit myself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\nTHAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR\n\n\nA prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything\nelse for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is\nthe sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force\nthat it not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often\nenables men to rise from a private station to that rank. And, on the\ncontrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than\nof arms they have lost their states. And the first cause of your losing\nit is to neglect this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is\nto be master of the art. Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from\na private person became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding\nthe hardships and troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons.\nFor among other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to\nbe despised, and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince\nought to guard himself, as is shown later on. Because there is nothing\nproportionate between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not\nreasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him\nwho is unarmed, or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed\nservants. Because, there being in the one disdain and in the other\nsuspicion, it is not possible for them to work well together. And\ntherefore a prince who does not understand the art of war, over and\nabove the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected by\nhis soldiers, nor can he rely on them. He ought never, therefore, to\nhave out of his thoughts this subject of war, and in peace he should\naddict himself more to its exercise than in war; this he can do in two\nways, the one by action, the other by study.\n\nAs regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well\norganized and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which he\naccustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of\nlocalities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the\nvalleys open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of\nrivers and marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care. Which\nknowledge is useful in two ways. Firstly, he learns to know his\ncountry, and is better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by\nmeans of the knowledge and observation of that locality, he understands\nwith ease any other which it may be necessary for him to study\nhereafter; because the hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and\nmarshes that are, for instance, in Tuscany, have a certain resemblance\nto those of other countries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of\none country one can easily arrive at a knowledge of others. And the\nprince that lacks this skill lacks the essential which it is desirable\nthat a captain should possess, for it teaches him to surprise his\nenemy, to select quarters, to lead armies, to array the battle, to\nbesiege towns to advantage.\n\nPhilopoemen,[1] Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which\nwriters have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he\nnever had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in\nthe country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: “If\nthe enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here\nwith our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best\nadvance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to retreat,\nhow ought we to pursue?” And he would set forth to them, as he went,\nall the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their\nopinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these\ncontinual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any\nunexpected circumstances that he could not deal with.\n\n [1] Philopoemen, “the last of the Greeks,” born 252 B.C., died 183\n B.C.\n\nBut to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and\nstudy there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne\nthemselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories and defeat,\nso as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and above all do as\nan illustrious man did, who took as an exemplar one who had been\npraised and famous before him, and whose achievements and deeds he\nalways kept in his mind, as it is said Alexander the Great imitated\nAchilles, Caesar Alexander, Scipio Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of\nCyrus, written by Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the life of\nScipio how that imitation was his glory, and how in chastity,\naffability, humanity, and liberality Scipio conformed to those things\nwhich have been written of Cyrus by Xenophon. A wise prince ought to\nobserve some such rules, and never in peaceful times stand idle, but\nincrease his resources with industry in such a way that they may be\navailable to him in adversity, so that if fortune chances it may find\nhim prepared to resist her blows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\nCONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES, ARE PRAISED OR\nBLAMED\n\n\nIt remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a\nprince towards subject and friends. And as I know that many have\nwritten on this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in\nmentioning it again, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from\nthe methods of other people. But, it being my intention to write a\nthing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me\nmore appropriate to follow up the real truth of the matter than the\nimagination of it; for many have pictured republics and principalities\nwhich in fact have never been known or seen, because how one lives is\nso far distant from how one ought to live, that he who neglects what is\ndone for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his\npreservation; for a man who wishes to act entirely up to his\nprofessions of virtue soon meets with what destroys him among so much\nthat is evil.\n\nHence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how\nto do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity.\nTherefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince,\nand discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are\nspoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are\nremarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or\npraise; and thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly,\nusing a Tuscan term (because an avaricious person in our language is\nstill he who desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly\nwho deprives himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed\ngenerous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless,\nanother faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave;\none affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one\nsincere, another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another\nfrivolous; one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know\nthat every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a\nprince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but\nbecause they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human\nconditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently\nprudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which\nwould lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible,\nfrom those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he\nmay with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need\nnot make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without\nwhich the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is\nconsidered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like\nvirtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which\nlooks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\nCONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS\n\n\nCommencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I\nsay that it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless,\nliberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation\nfor it, injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should\nbe exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the\nreproach of its opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among\nmen the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of\nmagnificence; so that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts\nall his property, and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to\nmaintain the name of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax\nthem, and do everything he can to get money. This will soon make him\nodious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by\nany one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded\nfew, he is affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by\nwhatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing\nto draw back from it, he runs at once into the reproach of being\nmiserly.\n\nTherefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of\nliberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if\nhe is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in\ntime he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that\nwith his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himself\nagainst all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without\nburdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises\nliberality towards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless,\nand meanness towards those to whom he does not give, who are few.\n\nWe have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have\nbeen considered mean; the rest have failed. Pope Julius the Second was\nassisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet he\ndid not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King\nof France; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax\non his subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his\nlong thriftiness. The present King of Spain would not have undertaken\nor conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. A\nprince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that\nhe can defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that he\nis not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account a\nreputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices which will\nenable him to govern.\n\nAnd if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and\nmany others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal,\nand by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince in fact,\nor in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is\ndangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal;\nand Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome;\nbut if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his\nexpenses, he would have destroyed his government. And if any one should\nreply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies,\nwho have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends\nthat which is his own or his subjects’ or else that of others. In the\nfirst case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to\nneglect any opportunity for liberality. And to the prince who goes\nforth with his army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion,\nhandling that which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary,\notherwise he would not be followed by soldiers. And of that which is\nneither yours nor your subjects’ you can be a ready giver, as were\nCyrus, Caesar, and Alexander; because it does not take away your\nreputation if you squander that of others, but adds to it; it is only\nsquandering your own that injures you.\n\nAnd there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst\nyou exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor\nor despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And a\nprince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised\nand hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser to\nhave a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred,\nthan to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to\nincur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\nCONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY, AND WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO BE LOVED\nTHAN FEARED\n\n\nComing now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every\nprince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel.\nNevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare\nBorgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled\nthe Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And if\nthis be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more\nmerciful than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for\ncruelty, permitted Pistoia to be destroyed.[1] Therefore a prince, so\nlong as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the\nreproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more\nmerciful than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to\narise, from which follow murders or robberies; for these are wont to\ninjure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a\nprince offend the individual only.\n\n [1] During the rioting between the Cancellieri and Panciatichi\n factions in 1502 and 1503.\n\nAnd of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the\nimputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. Hence\nVirgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign\nowing to its being new, saying:\n\n“Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt\nMoliri, et late fines custode tueri.”[2]\n\nNevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he\nhimself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and\nhumanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and\ntoo much distrust render him intolerable.\n\n [2] . . . against my will, my fate\nA throne unsettled, and an infant state,\nBid me defend my realms with all my pow’rs,\nAnd guard with these severities my shores.\n\nChristopher Pitt.\n\nUpon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than\nfeared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to\nbe both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it\nis much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be\ndispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that\nthey are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as\nyou succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood,\nproperty, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far\ndistant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince\nwho, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other\nprecautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by\npayments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be\nearned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied\nupon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than\none who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation\nwhich, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for\ntheir advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which\nnever fails.\n\nNevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he\ndoes not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well\nbeing feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he\nabstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their\nwomen. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of\nsomeone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause,\nbut above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others,\nbecause men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss\nof their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are\nnever wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always\nfind pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for\ntaking life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner\nlapse. But when a prince is with his army, and has under control a\nmultitude of soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard\nthe reputation of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army\nunited or disposed to its duties.\n\nAmong the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that\nhaving led an enormous army, composed of many various races of men, to\nfight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or\nagainst the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This\narose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his\nboundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his\nsoldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not\nsufficient to produce this effect. And short-sighted writers admire his\ndeeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal\ncause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been\nsufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most\nexcellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man,\nagainst whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from\nnothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more\nlicense than is consistent with military discipline. For this he was\nupbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of\nthe Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio,\nyet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate\npunished, owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone in\nthe Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew\nmuch better how not to err than to correct the errors of others. This\ndisposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have\ndestroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the\ncontrol of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed\nitself, but contributed to his glory.\n\nReturning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the\nconclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing\naccording to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself\non that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must\nendeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.[1]\nCONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH\n\n\n [1] “The present chapter has given greater offence than any other\n portion of Machiavelli’s writings.” Burd, “Il Principe,” p. 297.\n\nEvery one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and\nto live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience\nhas been that those princes who have done great things have held good\nfaith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect\nof men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on\ntheir word. You must know there are two ways of contesting,[2] the one\nby the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the\nsecond to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient,\nit is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is\nnecessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast\nand the man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient\nwriters, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were\ngiven to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his\ndiscipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who\nwas half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know\nhow to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not\ndurable. A prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the\nbeast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot\ndefend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against\nwolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares\nand a lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do\nnot understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor\nought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him,\nand when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If\nmen were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they\nare bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to\nobserve it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince\nlegitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless\nmodern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and\nengagements have been made void and of no effect through the\nfaithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the\nfox has succeeded best.\n\n [2] “Contesting,” _i.e_. “striving for mastery.” Mr Burd points out\n that this passage is imitated directly from Cicero’s “De Officiis”:\n “Nam cum sint duo genera decertandi, unum per disceptationem, alterum\n per vim; cumque illud proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugiendum\n est ad posterius, si uti non licet superiore.”\n\nBut it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic,\nand to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and\nso subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will\nalways find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. One recent\nexample I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the Sixth did nothing\nelse but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he\nalways found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power\nin asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would\nobserve it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to\nhis wishes,[3] because he well understood this side of mankind.\n\n [3] “Nondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni (ad votum).” The\n words “ad votum” are omitted in the Testina addition, 1550.\n\nAlexander never did what he said,\nCesare never said what he did.\n\nItalian Proverb.\n\nTherefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities\nI have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And\nI shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe\nthem is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear\nmerciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with\na mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able\nand know how to change to the opposite.\n\nAnd you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one,\ncannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being often\nforced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity,[4]\nfriendship, humanity, and religion. Therefore it is necessary for him\nto have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and\nvariations of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to\ndiverge from the good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then\nto know how to set about it.\n\n [4] “Contrary to fidelity” or “faith,” “contro alla fede,” and “tutto\n fede,” “altogether faithful,” in the next paragraph. It is noteworthy\n that these two phrases, “contro alla fede” and “tutto fede,” were\n omitted in the Testina edition, which was published with the sanction\n of the papal authorities. It may be that the meaning attached to the\n word “fede” was “the faith,” _i.e_. the Catholic creed, and not as\n rendered here “fidelity” and “faithful.” Observe that the word\n “religione” was suffered to stand in the text of the Testina, being\n used to signify indifferently every shade of belief, as witness “the\n religion,” a phrase inevitably employed to designate the Huguenot\n heresy. South in his Sermon IX, p. 69, ed. 1843, comments on this\n passage as follows: “That great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe,\n Nicolo Machiavel, laid down this for a master rule in his political\n scheme: ‘That the show of religion was helpful to the politician, but\n the reality of it hurtful and pernicious.’”\n\nFor this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything\nslip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five\nqualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether\nmerciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing\nmore necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as\nmen judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it\nbelongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you.\nEvery one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and\nthose few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who\nhave the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all\nmen, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge,\none judges by the result.\n\nFor that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding\nhis state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be\npraised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a\nthing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are\nonly the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have\nno ground to rest on.\n\nOne prince[5] of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never\npreaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is most\nhostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of\nreputation and kingdom many a time.\n\n [5] Ferdinand of Aragon. “When Machiavelli was writing _The Prince_ it\n would have been clearly impossible to mention Ferdinand’s name here\n without giving offence.” Burd’s “Il Principe,” p. 308.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\nTHAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED\n\n\nNow, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I\nhave spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discuss\nbriefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as has\nbeen in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make him\nhated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he will\nhave fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other\nreproaches.\n\nIt makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious,\nand to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from\nboth of which he must abstain. And when neither their property nor\ntheir honor is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has\nonly to contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease\nin many ways.\n\nIt makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous,\neffeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince\nshould guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in\nhis actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his\nprivate dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are\nirrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can\nhope either to deceive him or to get round him.\n\nThat prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself,\nand he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for,\nprovided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by\nhis people, he can only be attacked with difficulty. For this reason a\nprince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his\nsubjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. From\nthe latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies,\nand if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will\nalways remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they\nshould have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should\naffairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations\nand has lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will\nresist every attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.\n\nBut concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has\nonly to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince can\neasily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by\nkeeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary for\nhim to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most\nefficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not\nto be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against a\nprince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the\nconspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have\nthe courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront a\nconspirator are infinite. And as experience shows, many have been the\nconspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires\ncannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he\nbelieves to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind to\na malcontent you have given him the material with which to content\nhimself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so\nthat, seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the\nother to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare\nfriend, or a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith\nwith you.\n\nAnd, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side\nof the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of\npunishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the\nmajesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and\nthe state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the\npopular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to\nconspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the\nexecution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to\nthe crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and\nthus cannot hope for any escape.\n\nEndless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content\nwith one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers. Messer\nAnnibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the\npresent Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had\nconspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer\nGiovanni,[1] who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination\nthe people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from the\npopular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in\nBologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after\nthe death of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese,\nhaving information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in\nFlorence, who up to that time had been considered the son of a\nblacksmith, sent to Florence for him and gave him the government of\ntheir city, and it was ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due\ncourse to the government.\n\n [1] Giovanni Bentivogli, born in Bologna 1438, died at Milan 1508. He\n ruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506. Machiavelli’s strong condemnation of\n conspiracies may get its edge from his own very recent experience\n (February 1513), when he had been arrested and tortured for his\n alleged complicity in the Boscoli conspiracy.\n\nFor this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies\nof little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it is\nhostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear\neverything and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise princes have\ntaken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep\nthe people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most\nimportant objects a prince can have.\n\nAmong the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France,\nand in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty\nand security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its\nauthority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of\nthe nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths\nwould be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the\nhatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to\nprotect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care\nof the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be\nliable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people\nfor favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who\ncould beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the\nking. Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or\na greater source of security to the king and kingdom. From this one can\ndraw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs\nof reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in\ntheir own hands. And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish\nthe nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people.\n\nIt may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths\nof the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary to\nmy opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great\nqualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have\nbeen killed by subjects who have conspired against them. Wishing,\ntherefore, to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of\nsome of the emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were\nnot different to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only\nsubmit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who\nstudies the affairs of those times.\n\nIt seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to\nthe empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were\nMarcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son\nAntoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.\n\nThere is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the\nambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be\ncontended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to\nput up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so\nbeset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard\nthing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the\npeople loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring\nprince, whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold,\ncruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should\nexercise upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give\nvent to their own greed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors\nwere always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great\nauthority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the\nprincipality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours,\nwere inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about\ninjuring the people. Which course was necessary, because, as princes\ncannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to\navoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they\nought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the\nmost powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had\nneed of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the\npeople; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not,\naccordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.\n\nFrom these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being\nall men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane,\nand benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died\nhonoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title,\nand owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards,\nbeing possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always\nkept both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated\nnor despised.\n\nBut Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers,\nwho, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not\nendure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus,\nhaving given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt\nfor his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his\nadministration. And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as\nmuch by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a\nprince wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for\nwhen that body is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain\nyourself—it may be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles—you\nhave to submit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works\nwill do you harm.\n\nBut let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness,\nthat among the other praises which are accorded him is this, that in\nthe fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by\nhim unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who\nallowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became despised, the\narmy conspired against him, and murdered him.\n\nTurning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus\nCaracalla, and Maximinus, you will find them all cruel and\nrapacious-men who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to\ncommit every kind of iniquity against the people; and all, except\nSeverus, came to a bad end; but in Severus there was so much valour\nthat, keeping the soldiers friendly, although the people were oppressed\nby him, he reigned successfully; for his valour made him so much\nadmired in the sight of the soldiers and people that the latter were\nkept in a way astonished and awed and the former respectful and\nsatisfied. And because the actions of this man, as a new prince, were\ngreat, I wish to show briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the\nfox and the lion, which natures, as I said above, it is necessary for a\nprince to imitate.\n\nKnowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in\nSclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to\nRome and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the\npraetorian soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to\naspire to the throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy\nbefore it was known that he had started. On his arrival at Rome, the\nSenate, through fear, elected him emperor and killed Julian. After this\nthere remained for Severus, who wished to make himself master of the\nwhole empire, two difficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the\nAsiatic army, had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in\nthe west where Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne. And as he\nconsidered it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided\nto attack Niger and to deceive Albinus. To the latter he wrote that,\nbeing elected emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that\ndignity with him and sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that\nthe Senate had made Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted\nby Albinus as true. But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger,\nand settled oriental affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the\nSenate that Albinus, little recognizing the benefits that he had\nreceived from him, had by treachery sought to murder him, and for this\ningratitude he was compelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought him\nout in France, and took from him his government and life. He who will,\ntherefore, carefully examine the actions of this man will find him a\nmost valiant lion and a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and\nrespected by every one, and not hated by the army; and it need not be\nwondered at that he, a new man, was able to hold the empire so well,\nbecause his supreme renown always protected him from that hatred which\nthe people might have conceived against him for his violence.\n\nBut his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent\nqualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and\nacceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring of\nfatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which\ncaused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his ferocity and\ncruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single\nmurders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those\nof Alexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by\nthose he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the\nmidst of his army by a centurion. And here it must be noted that\nsuch-like deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and\ndesperate courage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who\ndoes not fear to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the\nless because they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do\nany grave injury to those whom he employs or has around him in the\nservice of the state. Antoninus had not taken this care, but had\ncontumeliously killed a brother of that centurion, whom also he daily\nthreatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was\na rash thing to do, and proved the emperor’s ruin.\n\nBut let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to\nhold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it, and\nhe had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his\npeople and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave\nhimself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he\nmight indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not\nmaintaining his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete\nwith gladiators, and doing other vile things, little worthy of the\nimperial majesty, he fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being\nhated by one party and despised by the other, he was conspired against\nand was killed.\n\nIt remains to discuss the character of Maximinus. He was a very warlike\nman, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander,\nof whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the\nthrone. This he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated\nand despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which brought\nhim into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a great\nindignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accession to\nhis dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the\nimperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity\nby having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire,\npractised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger at\nthe meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity. First Africa\nrebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italy\nconspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter,\nbesieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were\ndisgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so\nmany against him, murdered him.\n\nI do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being\nthoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring this\ndiscourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this\ndifficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far\nless degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some\nindulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that\nare veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were\nthe armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary\nto give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more\nnecessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy\nthe people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more\npowerful.\n\nFrom the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him\ntwelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend\nthe security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that,\nputting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them\nhis friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in\nthe hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the\npeople, he must keep them his friends. But you must note that the state\nof the Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that\nit is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an\nhereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old\nprince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by\nthose who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen. And this\nbeing an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality,\nbecause there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in\nnew ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state\nis old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its\nhereditary lord.\n\nBut returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will\nconsider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been\nfatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how\nit happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number in\nanother, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to\nunhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous for\nPertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, who was\nheir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly\ndestructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated\nSeverus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread in\nhis footsteps. Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot\nimitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow\nthose of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which\nare necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are\nproper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and\nfirm.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\nARE FORTRESSES, AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO WHICH PRINCES OFTEN RESORT,\nADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL?\n\n\n1. Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their\nsubjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions;\nothers have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid\nthemselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning\nof their governments; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown\nand destroyed them. And although one cannot give a final judgment on\nall of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those\nstates in which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak as\ncomprehensively as the matter of itself will admit.\n\n2. There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather\nwhen he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by\narming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted\nbecome faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your\nsubjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be\narmed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be\nhandled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they\nquite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter,\nconsidering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and\nservice should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarm\nthem, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either\nfor cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions\nbreeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it\nfollows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character\nalready shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient\nto defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects.\nTherefore, as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has\nalways distributed arms. Histories are full of examples. But when a\nprince acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old\none, then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those\nwho have been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time\nand opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters\nshould be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state\nshall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.\n\n3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed\nto say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by\nfortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their\ntributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily. This\nmay have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way\nbalanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for\nto-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use;\nrather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided\ncities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always\nassist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist. The\nVenetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the\nGuelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although\nthey never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these\ndisputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their\ndifferences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not\nafterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one\nparty at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue,\ntherefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be\npermitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the\nmore easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but\nif war comes this policy proves fallacious.\n\n4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the\ndifficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore\nfortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who\nhas a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes\nenemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may\nhave the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher,\nas by a ladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many\nconsider that a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with\ncraft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed\nit, his renown may rise higher.\n\n5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and\nassistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule were\ndistrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo\nPetrucci, Prince of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been\ndistrusted than by others. But on this question one cannot speak\ngenerally, for it varies so much with the individual; I will only say\nthis, that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have been\nhostile, if they are of a description to need assistance to support\nthemselves, can always be gained over with the greatest ease, and they\nwill be tightly held to serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as\nthey know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad\nimpression which he had formed of them; and thus the prince always\nextracts more profit from them than from those who, serving him in too\nmuch security, may neglect his affairs. And since the matter demands\nit, I must not fail to warn a prince, who by means of secret favours\nhas acquired a new state, that he must well consider the reasons which\ninduced those to favour him who did so; and if it be not a natural\naffection towards him, but only discontent with their government, then\nhe will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty, for\nit will be impossible to satisfy them. And weighing well the reasons\nfor this in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern\naffairs, we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make friends\nof those men who were contented under the former government, and are\ntherefore his enemies, than of those who, being discontented with it,\nwere favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it.\n\n6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states\nmore securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit\nto those who might design to work against them, and as a place of\nrefuge from a first attack. I praise this system because it has been\nmade use of formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in\nour times has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello\nso that he might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on\nreturning to his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia,\nrazed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province, and\nconsidered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the\nBentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses,\ntherefore, are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you\ngood in one way they injure you in another. And this question can be\nreasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than\nfrom foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear\nfrom foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone. The\ncastle of Milan, built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make,\nmore trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the\nstate. For this reason the best possible fortress is—not to be hated by\nthe people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they\nwill not save you if the people hate you, for there will never be\nwanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you.\nIt has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use\nto any prince, unless to the Countess of Forli,[1] when the Count\nGirolamo, her consort, was killed; for by that means she was able to\nwithstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan, and\nthus recover her state; and the posture of affairs was such at that\ntime that the foreigners could not assist the people. But fortresses\nwere of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her,\nand when the people, her enemy, were allied with foreigners. Therefore,\nit would have been safer for her, both then and before, not to have\nbeen hated by the people than to have had the fortresses. All these\nthings considered then, I shall praise him who builds fortresses as\nwell as him who does not, and I shall blame whoever, trusting in them,\ncares little about being hated by the people.\n\n [1] Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and Lucrezia\n Landriani, born 1463, died 1509. It was to the Countess of Forli that\n Machiavelli was sent as envoy on 1499. A letter from Fortunati to the\n countess announces the appointment: “I have been with the signori,”\n wrote Fortunati, “to learn whom they would send and when. They tell me\n that Nicolo Machiavelli, a learned young Florentine noble, secretary\n to my Lords of the Ten, is to leave with me at once.” _Cf_. “Catherine\n Sforza,” by Count Pasolini, translated by P. Sylvester, 1898.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\nHOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN RENOWN\n\n\nNothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and\nsetting a fine example. We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the\npresent King of Spain. He can almost be called a new prince, because he\nhas risen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be\nthe foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds\nyou will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. In the\nbeginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the\nfoundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without\nany fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile\noccupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations;\nthus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power\nand authority over them. He was able with the money of the Church and\nof the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the\nfoundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him.\nFurther, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater\nschemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and\nclearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable\nexample, nor one more rare. Under this same cloak he assailed Africa,\nhe came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his\nachievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the\nminds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the\nissue of them. And his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of\nthe other, that men have never been given time to work steadily against\nhim.\n\nAgain, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal\naffairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da\nMilano, who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil life\ndoing some extraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take some\nmethod of rewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about.\nAnd a prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action\nto gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man.\n\nA prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a\ndownright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he\ndeclares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course\nwill always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two\nof your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character\nthat, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not. In\neither case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare\nyourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if\nyou do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to the\nconqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been\nconquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to\nprotect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does not want\ndoubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who\nloses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in\nhand, court his fate.\n\nAntiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the Ætolians to drive out\nthe Romans. He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of the\nRomans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the\nRomans urged them to take up arms. This question came to be discussed\nin the council of the Achaeans, where the legate of Antiochus urged\nthem to stand neutral. To this the Roman legate answered: “As for that\nwhich has been said, that it is better and more advantageous for your\nstate not to interfere in our war, nothing can be more erroneous;\nbecause by not interfering you will be left, without favour or\nconsideration, the guerdon of the conqueror.” Thus it will always\nhappen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutrality,\nwhilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declare yourself with\narms. And irresolute princes, to avoid present dangers, generally\nfollow the neutral path, and are generally ruined. But when a prince\ndeclares himself gallantly in favour of one side, if the party with\nwhom he allies himself conquers, although the victor may be powerful\nand may have him at his mercy, yet he is indebted to him, and there is\nestablished a bond of amity; and men are never so shameless as to\nbecome a monument of ingratitude by oppressing you. Victories after all\nare never so complete that the victor must not show some regard,\nespecially to justice. But if he with whom you ally yourself loses, you\nmay be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he may aid you, and you\nbecome companions on a fortune that may rise again.\n\nIn the second case, when those who fight are of such a character that\nyou have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is it\ngreater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction of\none by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have saved\nhim; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with\nyour assistance, he remains at your discretion. And here it is to be\nnoted that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with\none more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others,\nunless necessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers\nyou are at his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as\npossible being at the discretion of any one. The Venetians joined with\nFrance against the Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which caused their\nruin, could have been avoided. But when it cannot be avoided, as\nhappened to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to\nattack Lombardy, then in such a case, for the above reasons, the prince\nought to favour one of the parties.\n\nNever let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe\ncourses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones,\nbecause it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid\none trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in\nknowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to\ntake the lesser evil.\n\nA prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour\nthe proficient in every art. At the same time he should encourage his\ncitizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce and\nagriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not\nbe deterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken\naway from him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes; but\nthe prince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things\nand designs in any way to honour his city or state.\n\nFurther, he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles\nat convenient seasons of the year; and as every city is divided into\nguilds or into societies,[1] he ought to hold such bodies in esteem,\nand associate with them sometimes, and show himself an example of\ncourtesy and liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the majesty\nof his rank, for this he must never consent to abate in anything.\n\n [1] “Guilds or societies,” “in arti o in tribu.” “Arti” were craft or\n trade guilds, _cf_. Florio: “Arte . . . a whole company of any trade\n in any city or corporation town.” The guilds of Florence are most\n admirably described by Mr Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject\n (Methuen, 1906). Institutions of a somewhat similar character, called\n “artel,” exist in Russia to-day, _cf_. Sir Mackenzie Wallace’s\n “Russia,” ed. 1905: “The sons . . . were always during the working\n season members of an artel. In some of the larger towns there are\n artels of a much more complex kind— permanent associations, possessing\n large capital, and pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the\n individual members.” The word “artel,” despite its apparent\n similarity, has, Mr Aylmer Maude assures me, no connection with “ars”\n or “arte.” Its root is that of the verb “rotisya,” to bind oneself by\n an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only another form of\n “rota,” which now signifies a “regimental company.” In both words the\n underlying idea is that of a body of men united by an oath. “Tribu”\n were possibly gentile groups, united by common descent, and included\n individuals connected by marriage. Perhaps our words “sects” or\n “clans” would be most appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\nCONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES\n\n\nThe choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they\nare good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And the\nfirst opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is\nby observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and\nfaithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how to\nrecognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they are\notherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime error\nwhich he made was in choosing them.\n\nThere were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of\nPandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to\nbe a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because there\nare three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself;\nanother which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which\nneither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first\nis the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless.\nTherefore, it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the\nfirst rank, he was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know\ngood and bad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have\nthe initiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his\nservant, and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the\nservant cannot hope to deceive him, and is kept honest.\n\nBut to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one\ntest which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his\nown interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in\neverything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you\never be able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in\nhis hands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince,\nand never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not\nconcerned.\n\nOn the other hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study\nhim, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing with\nhim the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see that he\ncannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him desire more,\nmany riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make him\ndread chances. When, therefore, servants, and princes towards servants,\nare thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise,\nthe end will always be disastrous for either one or the other.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\nHOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED\n\n\nI do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it\nis a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless\nthey are very careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers, of\nwhom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own\naffairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with\ndifficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they\nrun the danger of falling into contempt. Because there is no other way\nof guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that\nto tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tell\nyou the truth, respect for you abates.\n\nTherefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the\nwise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking\nthe truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires,\nand of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, and\nlisten to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions. With\nthese councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry\nhimself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more\nfreely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of\nthese, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be\nsteadfast in his resolutions. He who does otherwise is either\noverthrown by flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions\nthat he falls into contempt.\n\nI wish on this subject to adduce a modern example. Fra Luca, the man of\naffairs to Maximilian,[1] the present emperor, speaking of his majesty,\nsaid: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything.\nThis arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the\nabove; for the emperor is a secretive man—he does not communicate his\ndesigns to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them. But as in\ncarrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are at\nonce obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, being\npliant, is diverted from them. Hence it follows that those things he\ndoes one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he\nwishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions.\n\n [1] Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the Holy Roman\n Empire. He married, first, Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold; after\n her death, Bianca Sforza; and thus became involved in Italian\n politics.\n\nA prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he\nwishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every\none from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to\nbe a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning\nthe things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any\nconsideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be\nfelt.\n\nAnd if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impression\nof his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the good\nadvisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived,\nbecause this is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not\nwise himself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has\nyielded his affairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very\nprudent man. In this case indeed he may be well governed, but it would\nnot be for long, because such a governor would in a short time take\naway his state from him.\n\nBut if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more\nthan one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to\nunite them. Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests,\nand the prince will not know how to control them or to see through\nthem. And they are not to be found otherwise, because men will always\nprove untrue to you unless they are kept honest by constraint.\nTherefore it must be inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they\ncome, are born of the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the\nprince from good counsels.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\nWHY THE PRINCES OF ITALY HAVE LOST THEIR STATES\n\n\nThe previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new prince\nto appear well established, and render him at once more secure and\nfixed in the state than if he had been long seated there. For the\nactions of a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an\nhereditary one, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men\nand bind far tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more\nby the present than by the past, and when they find the present good\nthey enjoy it and seek no further; they will also make the utmost\ndefence of a prince if he fails them not in other things. Thus it will\nbe a double glory for him to have established a new principality, and\nadorned and strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and\nwith a good example; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a\nprince, shall lose his state by want of wisdom.\n\nAnd if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in\nItaly in our times, such as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and\nothers, there will be found in them, firstly, one common defect in\nregard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in\nthe next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the\npeople hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, he has not known\nhow to secure the nobles. In the absence of these defects states that\nhave power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost.\n\nPhilip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who\nwas conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to the\ngreatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him, yet being a\nwarlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles,\nhe sustained the war against his enemies for many years, and if in the\nend he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he retained the\nkingdom.\n\nTherefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their\nprincipalities after so many years’ possession, but rather their own\nsloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be a\nchange (it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the\ncalm against the tempest), and when afterwards the bad times came they\nthought of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped that\nthe people, disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would\nrecall them. This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very\nbad to have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would\nnever wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later\non to restore you. This again either does not happen, or, if it does,\nit will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no\navail which does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable,\ncertain, and durable that depend on yourself and your valour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\nWHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO WITHSTAND HER\n\n\nIt is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the\nopinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by\nfortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and\nthat no one can even help them; and because of this they would have us\nbelieve that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but to let\nchance govern them. This opinion has been more credited in our times\nbecause of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and may\nstill be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes\npondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion.\nNevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true\nthat Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions,[1] but that she\nstill leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.\n\n [1] Frederick the Great was accustomed to say: “The older one gets the\n more convinced one becomes that his Majesty King Chance does\n three-quarters of the business of this miserable universe.” Sorel’s\n “Eastern Question.”\n\nI compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood\noverflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away\nthe soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to\nits violence, without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet,\nthough its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men, when\nthe weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences\nand barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may pass\naway by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so\ndangerous. So it happens with fortune, who shows her power where valour\nhas not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces where\nshe knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain\nher.\n\nAnd if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and\nwhich has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open\ncountry without barriers and without any defence. For if it had been\ndefended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either\nthis invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it\nwould not have come at all. And this I consider enough to say\nconcerning resistance to fortune in general.\n\nBut confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be\nseen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change\nof disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from\ncauses that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the\nprince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes. I\nbelieve also that he will be successful who directs his actions\naccording to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not\naccord with the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in\naffairs that lead to the end which every man has before him, namely,\nglory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution,\nanother with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience,\nanother by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by\na different method. One can also see of two cautious men the one attain\nhis end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different\nobservances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other\nimpetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they\nconform in their methods to the spirit of the times. This follows from\nwhat I have said, that two men working differently bring about the same\neffect, and of two working similarly, one attains his object and the\nother does not.\n\nChanges in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs\nhimself with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in such a\nway that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if\ntimes and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change his course\nof action. But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to\nknow how to accommodate himself to the change, both because he cannot\ndeviate from what nature inclines him to do, and also because, having\nalways prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it\nis well to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is time\nto turn adventurous, does not know how to do it, hence he is ruined;\nbut had he changed his conduct with the times fortune would not have\nchanged.\n\nPope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and\nfound the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of\naction that he always met with success. Consider his first enterprise\nagainst Bologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive. The\nVenetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he\nhad the enterprise still under discussion with the King of France;\nnevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition with his\naccustomed boldness and energy, a move which made Spain and the\nVenetians stand irresolute and passive, the latter from fear, the\nformer from desire to recover the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand,\nhe drew after him the King of France, because that king, having\nobserved the movement, and desiring to make the Pope his friend so as\nto humble the Venetians, found it impossible to refuse him. Therefore\nJulius with his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff\nwith simple human wisdom could have done; for if he had waited in Rome\nuntil he could get away, with his plans arranged and everything fixed,\nas any other pontiff would have done, he would never have succeeded.\nBecause the King of France would have made a thousand excuses, and the\nothers would have raised a thousand fears.\n\nI will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they\nall succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience\nthe contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go\ncautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have\ndeviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.\n\nI conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind\nsteadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are\nsuccessful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider\nthat it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is a\nwoman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and\nill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by\nthe adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She\nis, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they\nare less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\nAN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS\n\n\nHaving carefully considered the subject of the above discourses, and\nwondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to a\nnew prince, and whether there were elements that would give an\nopportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of\nthings which would do honour to him and good to the people of this\ncountry, it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new\nprince that I never knew a time more fit than the present.\n\nAnd if, as I said, it was necessary that the people of Israel should be\ncaptive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses; that the Persians\nshould be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the\nsoul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should be dispersed to illustrate\nthe capabilities of Theseus: then at the present time, in order to\ndiscover the virtue of an Italian spirit, it was necessary that Italy\nshould be reduced to the extremity that she is now in, that she should\nbe more enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians,\nmore scattered than the Athenians; without head, without order, beaten,\ndespoiled, torn, overrun; and to have endured every kind of desolation.\n\nAlthough lately some spark may have been shown by one, which made us\nthink he was ordained by God for our redemption, nevertheless it was\nafterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune rejected\nhim; so that Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall yet\nheal her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of\nLombardy, to the swindling and taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany,\nand cleanse those sores that for long have festered. It is seen how she\nentreats God to send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs\nand barbarous insolencies. It is seen also that she is ready and\nwilling to follow a banner if only someone will raise it.\n\nNor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope\nthan in your illustrious house,[1] with its valour and fortune,\nfavoured by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and\nwhich could be made the head of this redemption. This will not be\ndifficult if you will recall to yourself the actions and lives of the\nmen I have named. And although they were great and wonderful men, yet\nthey were men, and each one of them had no more opportunity than the\npresent offers, for their enterprises were neither more just nor easier\nthan this, nor was God more their friend than He is yours.\n\n [1] Giuliano de Medici. He had just been created a cardinal by Leo X.\n In 1523 Giuliano was elected Pope, and took the title of Clement VII.\n\nWith us there is great justice, because that war is just which is\nnecessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in\nthem. Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness\nis great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those\nmen to whom I have directed your attention. Further than this, how\nextraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond example:\nthe sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the rock has poured forth\nwater, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to your\ngreatness; you ought to do the rest. God is not willing to do\neverything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory\nwhich belongs to us.\n\nAnd it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians\nhave been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious\nhouse; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many\ncampaigns, it has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted,\nthis has happened because the old order of things was not good, and\nnone of us have known how to find a new one. And nothing honours a man\nmore than to establish new laws and new ordinances when he himself was\nnewly risen. Such things when they are well founded and dignified will\nmake him revered and admired, and in Italy there are not wanting\nopportunities to bring such into use in every form.\n\nHere there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head.\nLook attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how\nsuperior the Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety. But\nwhen it comes to armies they do not bear comparison, and this springs\nentirely from the insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are\ncapable are not obedient, and each one seems to himself to know, there\nhaving never been any one so distinguished above the rest, either by\nvalour or fortune, that others would yield to him. Hence it is that for\nso long a time, and during so much fighting in the past twenty years,\nwhenever there has been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a\npoor account of itself; the first witness to this is Il Taro,\nafterwards Allesandria, Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.[2]\n\n [2] The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua, 1501;\n Genoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.\n\nIf, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable\nmen who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things,\nas a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your own\nforces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better\nsoldiers. And although singly they are good, altogether they will be\nmuch better when they find themselves commanded by their prince,\nhonoured by him, and maintained at his expense. Therefore it is\nnecessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended\nagainst foreigners by Italian valour.\n\nAnd although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very\nformidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which\na third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be\nrelied upon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry,\nand the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in\nclose combat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the\nSpaniards are unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are\noverthrown by Spanish infantry. And although a complete proof of this\nlatter cannot be shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at\nthe battle of Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by\nGerman battalions, who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the\nSpaniards, by agility of body and with the aid of their shields, got in\nunder the pikes of the Germans and stood out of danger, able to attack,\nwhile the Germans stood helpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed\nup, all would have been over with them. It is possible, therefore,\nknowing the defects of both these infantries, to invent a new one,\nwhich will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry; this need not\ncreate a new order of arms, but a variation upon the old. And these are\nthe kind of improvements which confer reputation and power upon a new\nprince.\n\nThis opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for\nletting Italy at last see her liberator appear. Nor can one express the\nlove with which he would be received in all those provinces which have\nsuffered so much from these foreign scourings, with what thirst for\nrevenge, with what stubborn faith, with what devotion, with what tears.\nWhat door would be closed to him? Who would refuse obedience to him?\nWhat envy would hinder him? What Italian would refuse him homage? To\nall of us this barbarous dominion stinks. Let, therefore, your\nillustrious house take up this charge with that courage and hope with\nwhich all just enterprises are undertaken, so that under its standard\nour native country may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be\nverified that saying of Petrarch:\n\nVirtu contro al Furore\n    Prendera l’arme, e fia il combatter corto:\nChe l’antico valore\n    Negli italici cuor non e ancor morto.\n\nVirtue against fury shall advance the fight,\n    And it i’ th’ combat soon shall put to flight:\nFor the old Roman valour is not dead,\n    Nor in th’ Italians’ brests extinguished.\n\nEdward Dacre, 1640.\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE VALENTINO WHEN MURDERING\nVITELLOZZO VITELLI, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, THE SIGNOR PAGOLO, AND THE\nDUKE DI GRAVINA ORSINI\n\nBY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI\n\n\nThe Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been to\nclear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been\nraised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of\nArezzo and other towns in the Val di Chiana, and had arrived at Imola,\nwhence he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against\nGiovanni Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna: for he intended to bring\nthat city under his domination, and to make it the head of his\nRomagnian duchy.\n\nThese matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and\ntheir following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too\npowerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seek\nto destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy. Upon\nthis a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia, to\nwhich came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini,\nVitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the\ntyrant of Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo\nPetrucci, the Prince of Siena. Here were discussed the power and\ncourage of the duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which\nmight otherwise bring danger to the rest of being ruined. And they\ndecided not to abandon the Bentivogli, but to strive to win over the\nFlorentines; and they sent their men to one place and another,\npromising to one party assistance and to another encouragement to unite\nwith them against the common enemy. This meeting was at once reported\nthroughout all Italy, and those who were discontented under the duke,\namong whom were the people of Urbino, took hope of effecting a\nrevolution.\n\nThus it arose that, men’s minds being thus unsettled, it was decided by\ncertain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which was held\nfor the duke, and which they captured by the following means. The\ncastellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there;\nso the conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were being\ncarried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from\nbeing drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping\nupon the bridge and thence into the fortress. Upon this capture being\neffected, the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being\nencouraged in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the\nDiet at Magione, from whom they expected to get assistance.\n\nThose who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose\nthe opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as to take any\ntown, should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state; and\nthey sent again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in\ndestroying the common firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and\nthat they ought not to wait for another opportunity.\n\nBut the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the Vitelli\nand Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo\nMachiavelli, their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the\nduke against his enemies. The duke was found full of fear at Imola,\nbecause, against everybody’s expectation, his soldiers had at once gone\nover to the enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door.\nBut recovering courage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided\nto temporize before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to\nhim, and to negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance.\nThis latter he obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France\nfor men and by enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into\ncavalry of a sort: to all he gave money.\n\nNotwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached\nFossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with the\naid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them. When this happened, the\nduke resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with\noffers of reconciliation, and being a most perfect dissembler he did\nnot fail in any practices to make the insurgents understand that he\nwished every man who had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough\nfor him to have the title of prince, whilst others might have the\nprincipality.\n\nAnd the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to\nhim to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their army to a\nstandstill. But the duke did not stop his preparations, and took every\ncare to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such\npreparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops in\nseparate parties to every part of the Romagna. In the meanwhile there\ncame also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found\nhimself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open\nwar, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous to\noutwit them, and for this reason he did not stop the work of\nreconciliation.\n\nAnd that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in\nwhich he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand\nducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formed\nan alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to come\npersonally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so. On the\nother hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and\nother places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and\nnot to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his\npermission.\n\nThis reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino,\nagain fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in his\nstate; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that the\nfortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by\nthe enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends.\nBut the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed\nhis men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of\nNovember together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to\nCesena, where he stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the\nVitelli and Orsini, who had assembled with their men in the duchy of\nUrbino, as to the enterprise in which they should now take part; but\nnothing being concluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that\nif the duke wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were\nready; if he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia. To\nthis the duke replied that he did not wish to enter into war with\nTuscany, and thus become hostile to the Florentines, but that he was\nvery willing to proceed against Sinigalia.\n\nIt happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the\nfortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give\nit up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted him to\ncome there. This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being\ninvited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no\nsuspicions. And the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French\nmen-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred\nlancers under Mons. di Candales, his brother-in-law. He left Cesena\nabout the middle of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmost\ncunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for\nhim at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance\nwould cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the\nreconciliation, and that he was a man who wished to make use of the\narms and councils of his friends. But Vitellozzo remained very\nstubborn, for the death of his brother warned him that he should not\noffend a prince and afterwards trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by\nPagolo Orsini, whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises, he\nagreed to wait.\n\nUpon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be on\n30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most\ntrusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor\nd’Euna, who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as\nVitellozzo, Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should\narrive, his followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting\ncertain men to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they\nreached Sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they\ncame to the duke’s quarters, where they should be seized.\n\nThe duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which\nthere were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to\nassemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from\nFano, and await him there. He found himself, therefore, on the last day\nof December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade of\nabout two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the\ninfantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.\n\nFano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situated on the shore of\nthe Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who\ngoes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases\nof which are touched by the sea in some places. The city of Sinigalia\nis distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot\nand from the shore about a mile. On the side opposite to the city runs\na little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards\nFano, facing the high road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes\nfor a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river\nwhich passes by Sinigalia. If he turns to his left hand along the bank\nof it, and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge\nwhich crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that\nleads into Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely. Before\nthis gate there stands a collection of houses with a square to which\nthe bank of the river forms one side.\n\nThe Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and\nto honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant\nfrom Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the men\nof the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band,\nwhich consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty\nhorsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above. Matters\nhaving been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and\nwhen the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass\nover, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and\nthe other towards the country, and a way was left in the middle through\nwhich the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town.\n\nVitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a\nfew horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a\ncape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his\napproaching death—a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the\nman and his former fortune, caused some amazement. And it is said that\nwhen he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet\nthe duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them. He\nrecommended his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his\nnephews that it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of\ntheir fathers that should be kept in mind. These three, therefore, came\nbefore the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him\nwith goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were\ncommissioned to look after them.\n\nBut the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band\nin Sinigalia, was missing—for Oliverotto was waiting in the square\nbefore his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and\ndrilling them—signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care\nof Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that\nOliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined\nOliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of\ntheir quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke;\nand he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come\nhimself to meet the duke. And Oliverotto, having taken this advice,\ncame before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and\nOliverotto, having made his obeisance, joined the others.\n\nSo the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke’s\nquarters, and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made\nthem prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that\nthe men of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms.\nThose of Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of\nthe Orsini and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment\nof the destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves,\nand bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and\nVitellian houses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the\ncountry and saved themselves.\n\nBut the duke’s soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the men\nof Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had not\nrepressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have\ncompletely sacked it. Night having come and the tumult being silenced,\nthe duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into a\nroom and caused them to be strangled. Neither of them used words in\nkeeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of\nthe pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the\nblame for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo. Pagolo and the\nDuke di Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome\nthat the pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of\nFlorence, and Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce. After which news, on 18th\nJanuary 1502, in the castle of Pieve, they also were strangled in the\nsame way.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA\n\nWRITTEN BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI\n\nAnd sent to his friends ZANOBI BUONDELMONTI And LUIGI ALAMANNI\n\nCASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 1284-1328\n\n\nIt appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who\nhave considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them,\nwho have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in\ntheir day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and\nobscurity; or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way.\nThey have either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have\nhad so mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to\nbe sons of Jove or of some other deity. It would be wearisome to relate\nwho these persons may have been because they are well known to\neverybody, and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to\nthose who read them, they are omitted. I believe that these lowly\nbeginnings of great men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to\nthe world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because\nshe begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in\ntheir career: thus all success must be attributed to her. Castruccio\nCastracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds, if he is\nmeasured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he was\nborn; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate nor distinguished\nin his birth, as the course of this history will show. It appeared to\nbe desirable to recall his memory, because I have discerned in him such\nindications of valour and fortune as should make him a great exemplar\nto men. I think also that I ought to call your attention to his\nactions, because you of all men I know delight most in noble deeds.\n\nThe family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families\nof Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in\nestate, as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a\nson Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca,\nand for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He\nhad an only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but\nBuonaccorso dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again\nwent to live with her brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the\nhouse where he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens,\nany person could have access to it without difficulty. One morning,\nshortly after sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio\nwas called, had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather\nherbs for seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the\nleaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard\nsomething resembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon she went towards\nit, and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the\nleaves and who seemed to be crying for its mother. Partly wondering and\npartly fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it\nto the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is\ncustomary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. When\nhe heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised\nor compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselves\nwhat should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no\nchildren, they finally determined to bring it up. They had a nurse for\nit, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. They\nbaptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father. As\nthe years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of\nwit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those\nlessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer Antonio intended\nto make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his\ncanonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with\nthis object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio\nwas quite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached\nthe age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of\nMesser Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left\noff reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms,\ndelighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in\nrunning, leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he\nfar excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at\nany time he did turn to books, only those pleased him which told of\nwars and the mighty deeds of men. Messer Antonio beheld all this with\nvexation and sorrow.\n\nThere lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family,\nnamed Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches,\nbodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He had\noften fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a\nGhibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentleman\nresided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most\nmornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the\ntop of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he\nhad often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street\nin those games of which I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far\nexcelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal\nauthority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer\nFrancesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being\ninformed of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt\na greater desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one\nday and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of\na gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in\nthe house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and the\nservices of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleased\nCastruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though he\nstood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer\nFrancesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable,\nnothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and\ntake up those of a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and\nin a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was\ndriven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear\nthat he would not be able to hold him much longer.\n\nThus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to\nthe house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was\nastonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that\nvirtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true\ngentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and\ncould manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and\ntournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others,\nand he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity. But what\nenhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful\nmodesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to\nothers, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his\nequals, and courteous to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved,\nnot only by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio\nhad reached his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia\nby the Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist\nthe Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces.\nCastruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this\nexpedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and\nhis name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all\nLombardy.\n\nCastruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation than he\nleft it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many\nfriends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary\nfor that purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son\nthirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio to\nbe his son’s tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he died\nFrancesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that\ngoodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to\nthe son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the\nfather. Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and\ntutor of Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and\ncreated a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the\nformer universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring\ntyrannical intentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli\nOpizi, the head of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of\nMesser Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him\nthat Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and\nholding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity;\ntherefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of\nhis eminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but\nafterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able\nto bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples\nand have him driven out of Lucca.\n\nThe Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo,\nwho being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became\ntheir lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca,\nwith whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting\ntheir restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought\ninto his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of\nthe Opizi. Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio\ncautiously fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies\nand munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few\ndays in case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon\nwith Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and\nPisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed\nUguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the\nportcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling\nthe people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. Uguccione\nentered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer\nGiorgio with all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The\ngovernor was driven out, and the government reformed according to the\nwishes of Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found\nthat more than one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those\nwho fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the\nheadquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most\nhostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.\n\nAs it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party\nthat the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they\ndetermined to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a\nlarge army in the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence\nthey marched to Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into\nLucca. Upon this Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and\nwith a number of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved\nagainst the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the\nenemy withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between\nMontecatini and Pescia. Uguccione now took up a position near to\nMontecarlo, and within about two miles of the enemy, and slight\nskirmishes between the horse of both parties were of daily occurrence.\nOwing to the illness of Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed\ncoming to battle with the enemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing\nworse, went to Montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the army\nin the hands of Castruccio. This change brought about the ruin of the\nGuelphs, who, thinking that the hostile army having lost its captain\nhad lost its head, grew over-confident. Castruccio observed this, and\nallowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief; he also\nshowed signs of fear, and did not allow any of the munitions of the\ncamp to be used. On the other side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the\nmore they saw these evidences of fear, and every day they drew out in\nthe order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio. Presently,\ndeeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered\ntheir tactics, he decided to join battle with them. First he spoke a\nfew words of encouragement to his soldiers, and pointed out to them the\ncertainty of victory if they would but obey his commands. Castruccio\nhad noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre\nof the line of battle, and his less reliable men on the wings of the\narmy; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most valiant\nmen on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he\nmoved to the centre. Observing this order of battle, he drew out of his\nlines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army, who, as usual, had\ncome in their insolence to defy him. He then commanded his centre\nsquadrons to march slowly, whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the\nwings. Thus, when they came into contact with the enemy, only the wings\nof the two armies became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained\nout of action, for these two portions of the line of battle were\nseparated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach\neach other. By this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccio’s men\nwere opposed to the weaker part of the enemy’s troops, and the most\nefficient men of the enemy were disengaged; and thus the Florentines\nwere unable to fight with those who were arrayed opposite to them, or\nto give any assistance to their own flanks. So, without much\ndifficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flanks, and the\ncentre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to\nattack, without having a chance of displaying their valour. The defeat\nwas complete, and the loss in men very heavy, there being more than ten\nthousand men killed with many officers and knights of the Guelph party\nin Tuscany, and also many princes who had come to help them, among whom\nwere Piero, the brother of King Ruberto, and Carlo, his nephew, and\nFilippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of Castruccio the loss did\nnot amount to more than three hundred men, among whom was Francesco,\nthe son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was killed in the\nfirst onset.\n\nThis victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that\nUguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it\nappeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of\npower, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only\nwaited for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the\ndeath of Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in\nLucca, the murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge.\nOn the sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were\ndriven off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming\nto the knowledge of Uguccione, who was then at Pisa, it appeared to him\na proper opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his\nson Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take\nCastruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio,\nfearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was\nentertained at supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing\nto put him to death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive,\nin order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions.\nUgucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once\nset out from Pisa to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the\nbusiness in his own way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the\nPisans rebelled and put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo\ndella Gherardesca their lord. Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard\nof the occurrences at Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn\nback, lest the Lucchese with the example of Pisa before them should\nclose their gates against him. But the Lucchese, having heard of what\nhad happened at Pisa, availed themselves of this opportunity to demand\nthe liberation of Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had\narrived in their city. They first began to speak of it in private\ncircles, afterwards openly in the squares and streets; then they raised\na tumult, and with arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded\nthat Castruccio should be set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse\nmight happen, released him from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered\nhis friends around him, and with the help of the people attacked\nUguccione; who, finding he had no resource but in flight, rode away\nwith his friends to Lombardy, to the lords of Scale, where he died in\npoverty.\n\nBut Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca,\nand he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people\nthat they appointed him captain of their army for one year. Having\nobtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the\nrecovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of\nUguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded\na treaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed\na fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course\nof two months Castruccio captured the town. With the reputation gained\nat that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in a\nshort time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the\npass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and\nwrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the\nlord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed\nby the whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any\nlonger to defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord\nof Lucca by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico,\nFrancesco Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had\ncorrupted; and he was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected\nprince by the people. At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of\nthe Romans, came into Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and\nCastruccio, in order that he might make friends with him, met him at\nthe head of five hundred horsemen. Castruccio had left as his deputy in\nLucca, Pagolo Guinigi, who was held in high estimation, because of the\npeople’s love for the memory of his father. Castruccio was received in\ngreat honour by Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him,\nand he was appointed the emperor’s lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time\nthe Pisans were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had\ndriven out of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick.\nFrederick created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread\nof the Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were\nconstrained to accept him as their lord.\n\nFrederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian\naffairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian\nGhibellines, who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio\nfor help and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his\ncountry, if enabled to recover it with his assistance. Among these\nexiles were Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi,\nand Piero Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines.\nCastruccio had the secret intention of becoming the master of all\nTuscany by the aid of these men and of his own forces; and in order to\ngain greater weight in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer\nMatteo Visconti, the Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces\nof his city and the country districts. As Lucca had five gates, he\ndivided his own country districts into five parts, which he supplied\nwith arms, and enrolled the men under captains and ensigns, so that he\ncould quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers, without\nthose whom he could summon to his assistance from Pisa. While he\nsurrounded himself with these forces and allies, it happened at Messer\nMatteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven\nout the Ghibellines with the assistance of a Florentine army and the\nKing Ruberto. Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the\nFlorentines in their own territories, so that, being attacked at home,\nthey should be compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to\ndefend themselves. Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized\nFucecchio and San Miniato, inflicting immense damage upon the country.\nWhereupon the Florentines recalled their army, which had scarcely\nreached Tuscany, when Castruccio was forced by other necessities to\nreturn to Lucca.\n\nThere resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so\npowerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance\nhim to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not\nreceived such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited\nother families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They\nfound their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set\nupon the lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and\nkilled him. They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano\ndi Poggio, a peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion,\nintervened and compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms;\nand he offered to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him\nwhat they desired. Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater\nintelligence than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard the\nnews of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi in\ncommand of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home.\nContrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he\nposted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city. As\nit appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to\nhim, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf,\nfor he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to\npardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their\nformer friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to\ntheir house. To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged\nStefano to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure\nto find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to\nhear of its inception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to\nhim, saying that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of\nshowing his clemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and\nCastruccio they surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown\ninto prison and put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered\nSan Miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace,\nas it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to\nleave him. He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce,\nwhich they readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and\ndesirous of getting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded\nwith them for two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the\nconquests they had made. Castruccio thus released from this trouble,\nturned his attention to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should\nnot again be subject to the perils from which he had just escaped, he,\nunder various pretences and reasons, first wiped out all those who by\ntheir ambition might aspire to the principality; not sparing one of\nthem, but depriving them of country and property, and those whom he had\nin his hands of life also, stating that he had found by experience that\nnone of them were to be trusted. Then for his further security he\nraised a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom\nhe had killed or hunted out of the state.\n\nWhilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his\nposition in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of\nincreasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he\ncould get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence,\nwhich was his great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends\nwith the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both\nparties confided their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it\nalways had been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the\nBianchi was Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each\nof these men held secret communications with Castruccio, and each\ndesired to drive the other out of the city; and, after many\nthreatenings, they came to blows. Jacopo fortified himself at the\nFlorentine gate, Bastiano at that of the Lucchese side of the city;\nboth trusted more in Castruccio than in the Florentines, because they\nbelieved that Castruccio was far more ready and willing to fight than\nthe Florentines, and they both sent to him for assistance. He gave\npromises to both, saying to Bastiano that he would come in person, and\nto Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo Guinigi. At the\nappointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa, and went himself\ndirect to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside the city, and\nboth were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders entered, and at a\nsignal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia, and the other\nBastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed the partisans\nof either faction. Without further opposition Pistoia passed into the\nhands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to leave the\npalace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him, making them\nmany promises and remitting their old debts. The countryside flocked to\nthe city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope and\nquickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great\nvalour.\n\nAbout this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness\nof living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon.\nThe German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened—murders\nand tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put\nan end to them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should\ncall in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of\nthe city, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he\ncould apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not\nonly to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome.\nCastruccio considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the\nemperor this service, because he believed that he himself would not be\nsafe if at any time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo\nGuinigi in command at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six\nhundred horsemen, where he was received by Enrico with the greatest\ndistinction. In a short time the presence of Castruccio obtained such\nrespect for the emperor that, without bloodshed or violence, good order\nwas restored, chiefly by reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from\nthe country round Pisa large quantities of corn, and thus removed the\nsource of the trouble. When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders,\nand admonished others, voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico.\nCastruccio received many honours, and was made a Roman senator. This\ndignity was assumed with the greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in\na brocaded toga, which had the following words embroidered on its\nfront: “I am what God wills.” Whilst on the back was: “What God desires\nshall be.”\n\nDuring this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio\nshould have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could\ntempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be\ndifficult in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were\nBaldo Cecchi and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face\ndanger. These men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia,\nand with the aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and\nafter driving out some of Castruccio’s officials and partisans, and\nkilling others, they restored the city to its freedom. The news of this\ngreatly angered Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on\nin great haste to Pistoia. When the Florentines heard of his return,\nknowing that he would lose no time, they decided to intercept him with\ntheir forces in the Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so\nthey would cut off his road to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of the\nsupporters of the Guelph cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian\nterritories. On the other hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his\narmy; and having heard where the Florentines’ lay, he decided not to\nencounter it in the plains of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of\nPescia, but, as far as he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the\nPass of Serravalle. He believed that if he succeeded in this design,\nvictory was assured, although he was informed that the Florentines had\nthirty thousand men, whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he\nhad every confidence in his own abilities and the valour of his troops,\nyet he hesitated to attack his enemy in the open lest he should be\noverwhelmed by numbers. Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and\nPistoia, situated on a hill which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the\nexact pass, but about a bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places\nnarrow and steep, whilst in general it ascends gently, but is still\nnarrow, especially at the summit where the waters divide, so that\ntwenty men side by side could hold it. The lord of Serravalle was\nManfred, a German, who, before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia, had\nbeen allowed to remain in possession of the castle, it being common to\nthe Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed by either—neither of them\nwishing to displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of\nneutrality, and came under obligations to no one. For these reasons,\nand also because the castle was well fortified, he had always been able\nto maintain his position. It was here that Castruccio had determined to\nfall upon his enemy, for here his few men would have the advantage, and\nthere was no fear lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile force\nbefore they became engaged, they should not stand. As soon as this\ntrouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the immense advantage which\npossession of this castle would give him, and having an intimate\nfriendship with a resident in the castle, he managed matters so with\nhim that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into the castle\nthe night before the attack on the Florentines, and the castellan put\nto death.\n\nCastruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the\nFlorentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away\nfrom Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his\narmy from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they\nreached their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill\non the following morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the\ncastle at night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching\nfrom thence at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of\nSerravalle: thus he and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the\nhill at the same time in the morning. Castruccio sent forward his\ninfantry by the main road, and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a\npath on the left towards the castle. The Florentines sent forward four\nhundred cavalry ahead of their army which was following, never\nexpecting to find Castruccio in possession of the hill, nor were they\naware of his having seized the castle. Thus it happened that the\nFlorentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely taken by surprise\nwhen they discovered the infantry of Castruccio, and so close were they\nupon it they had scarcely time to pull down their visors. It was a case\nof unready soldiers being attacked by ready, and they were assailed\nwith such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own,\nalthough some few of them got through. When the noise of the fighting\nreached the Florentine camp below, it was filled with confusion. The\ncavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed: the captains were\nunable to get their men either backward or forward, owing to the\nnarrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought\nto be done or what could be done. In a short time the cavalry who were\nengaged with the enemy’s infantry were scattered or killed without\nhaving made any effective defence because of their unfortunate\nposition, although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout\nresistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on both\nflanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their\nfriends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a\ndecisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand\ninfantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred\nhorsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole\nforce to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These orders they carried\nout with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack,\nbut gave way, and were soon in full retreat—conquered more by their\nunfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy. Those in the\nrear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each man\nseeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and very\nsanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were Bandini\ndei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all\nFlorentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on\nthe Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the\nGuelphs. Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out\nthe friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was not\ncontent with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both\nsides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola,\nabout two miles from Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing the\nspoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding\nhorse races, and foot races for men and women. He also struck medals in\ncommemoration of the defeat of the Florentines. He endeavoured to\ncorrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the city\ngates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the\nparticipators in it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci\nand Lambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the Florentines great\nanxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys\nto King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and\nhe, knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph\ncause was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to\nreceive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and\nhe sent his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.\n\nShortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the\npressure of Castruccio’s army, owing to his being compelled to leave\nhis positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a\nconspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi,\none of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland\nshould be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed this\nconspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of\nCastruccio, and drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracy\npaucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few\nare not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy\nLanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio.\nThis betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio\nCerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering\ntheir banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put\nhim to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their\nfamilies into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and\nPistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and\nenergy upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines\ntheir opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of\nCarlo, the son of the King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided\nto lose no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty\nthousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry—having called to their aid\nevery Guelph there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should\nattack Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to\nmarch on the latter—a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more\nlikely to succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed\nthat the surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa.\n\nIn the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army\nand quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from\nthence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous army\nwhich the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree\nalarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would\ndeliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to\nthink that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects\nof success, than at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousand\nfoot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to\nFucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand\ninfantry. Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in the\nPisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and\nGusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain.\nMoreover, the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they\ndivided their forces, nor could they approach it either from the\ndirection of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or\nattack Castruccio’s forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they\nwould find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his\nown command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they\nwould have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy,\nan undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to\ntake this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of\nthe river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide\nexpanse of land between them and the river.\n\nThe Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to\ndecide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and,\nhaving weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the\nlatter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet\nthe water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the\nsaddles of the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the\nFlorentines commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of\ncavalry and ten thousand infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was\nfixed, and who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines\nwith five thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing\nthem to issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one\nthousand light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the\nArno. The infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their\narms and the water that they were not able to mount the banks of the\nriver, whilst the cavalry had made the passage of the river more\ndifficult for the others, by reason of the few who had crossed having\nbroken up the bed of the river, and this being deep with mud, many of\nthe horses rolled over with their riders and many of them had stuck so\nfast that they could not move. When the Florentine captains saw the\ndifficulties their men were meeting, they withdrew them and moved\nhigher up the river, hoping to find the river bed less treacherous and\nthe banks more adapted for landing. These men were met at the bank by\nthe forces which Castruccio had already sent forward, who, being light\narmed with bucklers and javelins in their hands, let fly with\ntremendous shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry. The horses,\nalarmed by the noise and the wounds, would not move forward, and\ntrampled each other in great confusion. The fight between the men of\nCastruccio and those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp\nand terrible; both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither\nwould yield. The soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others back\ninto the river, whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing on land\nin order to make room for the others pressing forward, who if they\ncould but get out of the water would be able to fight, and in this\nobstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains. Castruccio\nshouted to his men that these were the same enemies whom they had\nbefore conquered at Serravalle, whilst the Florentines reproached each\nother that the many should be overcome by the few. At length\nCastruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted, and that both his\nmen and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that both sides had many\nkilled and wounded, pushed forward another body of infantry to take up\na position at the rear of those who were fighting; he then commanded\nthese latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat, and\none part of them to turn to the right and another to the left. This\ncleared a space of which the Florentines at once took advantage, and\nthus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield. But when these\ntired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with Castruccio’s\nreserves they could not stand against them and at once fell back into\nthe river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any\ndecisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his\ninferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the\ndefensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that\nwhen he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work\nof the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the\nFlorentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder\nof his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy. This they did with\nlance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the\nenemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight. The Florentine\ncaptains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in\ncrossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower\ndown the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio’s army. But\nhere, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of\nCastruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines\nwere so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them\nescaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains\nwere taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with\nMichelagnolo Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine\ncommissioners, fled to Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter\nwas infinitely greater, as might be expected in such a battle. Of the\nFlorentines there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men,\nwhilst Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy men.\n\nBut Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his\nlife just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus\nruined all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry\ninto effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but\ndeath could have stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle\nthe whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued\nand overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on\ntheir return from victory and personally thank them. He was also on the\nwatch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day;\nhe being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be\nthe first man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio\nstood exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the\nArno, and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of\nwhich he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it\nwas the cause of his death. On the following night he was attacked with\nhigh fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must\nprove fatal. Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and\naddressed him as follows:\n\n“If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the\nmidst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my\nsuccesses promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have left\nthee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils,\nbecause I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and\nPisa. I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the\nFlorentines with so many injuries. But I would have made both these\npeoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least\nmore peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but\none more secure and established on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who\ninsists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me\nwith sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time\nto surmount it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have\nnever concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a\nboy—a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should\nfeel—and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had been\nborn of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and\ncapable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been\nwitness. When thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all\nhis possessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love,\nand increased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show. And\nin order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy\nfather left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained,\nI have never married, so that the love of children should never deflect\nmy mind from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father.\nThus I leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am\ndeeply concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure.\nThou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest\ncontented under thy government. Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are\nof nature changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be\nsometimes held in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under\na Lucchese. Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with\nfactions and deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs\nrecently inflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended\nFlorentines, injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly\ndestroyed, who will hail the news of my death with more delight than\nthey would the acquisition of all Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the\nprinces of Milan thou canst place no reliance, for they are far\ndistant, slow, and their help is very long in coming. Therefore, thou\nhast no hope in anything but in thine own abilities, and in the memory\nof my valour, and in the prestige which this latest victory has brought\nthee; which, as thou knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist\nthee to come to terms with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering\nunder this great defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. And\nwhereas I have sought to make them my enemies, because I believed that\nwar with them would conduce to my power and glory, thou hast every\ninducement to make friends of them, because their alliance will bring\nthee advantages and security. It is of the greatest important in this\nworld that a man should know himself, and the measure of his own\nstrength and means; and he who knows that he has not a genius for\nfighting must learn how to govern by the arts of peace. And it will be\nwell for thee to rule thy conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this\nway to enjoy what my life-work and dangers have gained; and in this\nthou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that what I\nhave told thee is true. And thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that\nI have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it.”\n\nAfter this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia,\nand Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending\nPagolo to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his\nsuccessor, he died. He left a happy memory to those who had known him,\nand no prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he\nwas. His obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he\nwas buried in San Francesco at Lucca. Fortune was not so friendly to\nPagolo Guinigi as she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the\nabilities. Not long after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa,\nand then Pistoia, and only with difficulty held on to Lucca. This\nlatter city continued in the family of Guinigi until the time of the\ngreat-grandson of Pagolo.\n\nFrom what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a\nman of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own time,\nbut also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above the\nordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious\npresence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke\nwith him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red,\nand he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or\nsnowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends,\nbut terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false\nwith the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he\ndesired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory\nthat brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was\nbolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He\nwas accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear\nnothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees\nthat the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully\nsharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look\nfor any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not\nangered with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that\nhe has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on\nthe following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a\npartridge, and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom\nCastruccio had said: “You would not have given more than a penny.”\n“That is true,” answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: “A\nducat is much less to me.” Having about him a flatterer on whom he had\nspat to show that he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: “Fisherman\nare willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that\nthey may take a few little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by\nspittle that I may catch a whale”; and this was not only heard by\nCastruccio with patience but rewarded. When told by a priest that it\nwas wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: “If that be\na vice then you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our\nsaints.” Passing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of\na house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him:\n“Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest\ninto such places.” A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo\nand was told: “Fool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which\ngave so much trouble to fasten.” Castruccio said to one who professed\nto be a philosopher: “You are like the dogs who always run after those\nwho will give them the best to eat,” and was answered: “We are rather\nlike the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest\nneed of them.” Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much\ndisturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for\ncowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not fear\nanything. Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that, since\nevery man valued his soul for what is was worth. Being asked by one\nwhat he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: “When thou goest to a\nbanquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon\nanother.” To a person who was boasting that he had read many things,\nCastruccio said: “He knows better than to boast of remembering many\nthings.” Someone bragged that he could drink much without becoming\nintoxicated. Castruccio replied: “An ox does the same.” Castruccio was\nacquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations, and being\nblamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be\ntaken in by a woman, he said: “She has not taken me in, I have taken\nher.” Being also blamed for eating very dainty foods, he answered:\n“Thou dost not spend as much as I do?” and being told that it was true,\nhe continued: “Then thou art more avaricious than I am gluttonous.”\nBeing invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and splendid citizen of\nLuca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown by Taddeo into a\nchamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones representing flowers\nand foliage of the most beautiful colouring. Castruccio gathered some\nsaliva in his mouth and spat it out upon Taddeo, and seeing him much\ndisturbed by this, said to him: “I knew not where to spit in order to\noffend thee less.” Being asked how Caesar died he said: “God willing I\nwill die as he did.” Being one night in the house of one of his\ngentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was reproved by one of\nhis friends for dancing and amusing himself with them more than was\nusual in one of his station, so he said: “He who is considered wise by\nday will not be considered a fool at night.” A person came to demand a\nfavour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea\nthrew himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by\nCastruccio, said: “Thou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast\nthy ears in thy feet,” whereupon he obtained double the favour he had\nasked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one,\nseeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled\nblindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous\nwords, he said to him: “When you have another request to make, send\nsomeone else to make it.” Having been wearied by a similar man with a\nlong oration who wound up by saying: “Perhaps I have fatigued you by\nspeaking so long,” Castruccio said: “You have not, because I have not\nlistened to a word you said.” He used to say of one who had been a\nbeautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he was\ndangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he\ntook the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who laughed, he\nsaid: “Do you laugh because you are successful or because another is\nunfortunate?” Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco\nGuinigi, one of his companions said to him: “What shall I give you if\nyou will let me give you a blow on the nose?” Castruccio answered: “A\nhelmet.” Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been\ninstrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done\nwrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived\nthemselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio praised greatly\nthose men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying\nthat they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused\nwhen the time came. He said that it always struck him with surprise\nthat whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first\nto learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with\nonly looking at her. He was once asked in what manner he would wish to\nbe buried when he died, and answered: “With the face turned downwards,\nfor I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down.” On\nbeing asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order\nto save his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared\nstrange to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione\ndella Faggiuola to the Inferno. He was once asked when should a man eat\nto preserve his health, and replied: “If the man be rich let him eat\nwhen he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can.” Seeing one of his\ngentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: “I\npray God that you will let him feed you also.” Seeing that someone had\nwritten upon his house in Latin the words: “May God preserve this house\nfrom the wicked,” he said, “The owner must never go in.” Passing\nthrough one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door,\nand remarked: “That house will fly through the door.” He was having a\ndiscussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the\nproperty of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them,\nand the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king. “Is this\nking of yours a bad man or a good one?” asked Castruccio, and was told\nthat he was a good one, whereupon he said, “Why should you suggest that\nI should be afraid of a good man?”\n\nI could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and\nweighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to his\nhigh qualities. He lived forty-four years, and was in every way a\nprince. And as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune,\nso he also desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune;\ntherefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be\nseen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they\nwere placed by him to testify forever to his days of adversity. As in\nhis life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon, the father of\nAlexander, nor to Scipio of Rome, so he died in the same year of his\nage as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had\nFortune decreed that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia\nor Rome.\n\n\n`\n);\n\nexport const theGreatGatsby = new Book(\n  'The Great Gatsby',\n  `\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n by\nF.

In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a\nhabit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me\nthe victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to\ndetect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal\nperson, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of\nbeing a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,\nunknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have\nfeigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by\nsome unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on\nthe horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least\nthe terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and\nmarred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of\ninfinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I\nforget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly\nrepeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out\nunequally at birth.\n\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission\nthat it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the\nwet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded\non. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted\nthe world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I\nwanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\nhuman heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\nexempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I\nhave an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\nsuccessful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\nto one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\nthousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\n“creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a\nromantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and\nwhich it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out\nall right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust\nfloated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my\ninterest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle\nWestern city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a\nclan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of\nBuccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s\nbrother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil\nWar, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father\ncarries on today.\n\nI never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with\nspecial reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in\nfather’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of\na century after my father, and a little later I participated in that\ndelayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the\ncounter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being\nthe warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the\nragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond\nbusiness. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it\ncould support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it\nover as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said,\n“Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance\nme for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I\nthought, in the spring of twenty-two.\n\nThe practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm\nseason, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly\ntrees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a\nhouse together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He\nfound the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a\nmonth, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and\nI went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a\nfew days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who\nmade my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to\nherself over the electric stove.\n\nIt was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more\nrecently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.\n\n“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.\n\nI told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide,\na pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the\nfreedom of the neighbourhood.\n\nAnd so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the\ntrees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar\nconviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.\n\nThere was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to\nbe pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen\nvolumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they\nstood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,\npromising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and\nMaecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other\nbooks besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a\nseries of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now\nI was going to bring back all such things into my life and become\nagain that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.”\nThis isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at\nfrom a single window, after all.\n\nIt was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of\nthe strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender\nriotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where\nthere are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of\nland. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in\ncontour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most\ndomesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great\nwet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the\negg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact\nend—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\nwonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more\ninteresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular\nexcept shape and size.\n\nI lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though\nthis is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little\nsinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the\negg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge\nplaces that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on\nmy right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual\nimitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one\nside, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble\nswimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was\nGatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a\nmansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an\neyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I\nhad a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and\nthe consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a\nmonth.\n\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg\nglittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins\non the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom\nBuchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom\nin college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in\nChicago.\n\nHer husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of\nthe most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a\nnational figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute\nlimited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of\nanticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his\nfreedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago\nand come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\ninstance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake\nForest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was\nwealthy enough to do that.\n\nWhy they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for\nno particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully\nwherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a\npermanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe\nit—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift\non forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of\nsome irrecoverable football game.\n\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East\nEgg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house\nwas even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white\nGeorgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at\nthe beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,\njumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when\nit reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though\nfrom the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French\nwindows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm\nwindy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with\nhis legs apart on the front porch.\n\nHe had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy\nstraw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a\nsupercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established\ndominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning\naggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding\nclothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill\nthose glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could\nsee a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his\nthin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.\n\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\nfractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in\nit, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who\nhad hated his guts.\n\n“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to\nsay, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We\nwere in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I\nalways had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like\nhim with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\n\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n\n“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about\nrestlessly.\n\nTurning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the\nfront vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half\nacre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped\nthe tide offshore.\n\n“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again,\npolitely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”\n\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,\nfragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The\nwindows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside\nthat seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through\nthe room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale\nflags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the\nceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow\non it as wind does on the sea.\n\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous\ncouch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an\nanchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were\nrippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a\nshort flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments\nlistening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a\npicture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the\nrear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the\ncurtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the\nfloor.\n\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full\nlength at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her\nchin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which\nwas quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes\nshe gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring\nan apology for having disturbed her by coming in.\n\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly\nforward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,\ncharming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\nroom.\n\n“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”\n\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my\nhand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was\nno one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she\nhad. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was\nBaker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less\ncharming.)\n\nAt any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\nimperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object\nshe was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her\nsomething of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.\nAlmost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned\ntribute from me.\n\nI looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,\nthrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and\ndown, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be\nplayed again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\nbright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement\nin her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\na singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had\ndone gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\nexciting things hovering in the next hour.\n\nI told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,\nand how a dozen people had sent their love through me.\n\n“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.\n\n“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel\npainted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all\nnight along the north shore.”\n\n“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!” Then she added\nirrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”\n\n“I’d like to.”\n\n“She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?”\n\n“Never.”\n\n“Well, you ought to see her. She’s—”\n\nTom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped\nand rested his hand on my shoulder.\n\n“What you doing, Nick?”\n\n“I’m a bond man.”\n\n“Who with?”\n\nI told him.\n\n“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.\n\nThis annoyed me.\n\n“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the East.”\n\n“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at\nDaisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something\nmore. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”\n\nAt this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that\nI started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the\nroom. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned\nand with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\n\n“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long\nas I can remember.”\n\n“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to\nNew York all afternoon.”\n\n“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the\npantry. “I’m absolutely in training.”\n\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\n\n“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom\nof a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”\n\nI looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I\nenjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with\nan erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward\nat the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked\nback at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,\ndiscontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a\npicture of her, somewhere before.\n\n“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody\nthere.”\n\n“I don’t know a single—”\n\n“You must know Gatsby.”\n\n“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”\n\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;\nwedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled\nme from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\n\nSlenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two\nyoung women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward\nthe sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the\ndiminished wind.\n\n“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\nfingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She\nlooked at us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest day\nof the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in\nthe year and then miss it.”\n\n“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\ntable as if she were getting into bed.\n\n“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me\nhelplessly: “What do people plan?”\n\nBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\nlittle finger.\n\n“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”\n\nWe all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.\n\n“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean to,\nbut you did do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a\ngreat, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”\n\n“I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in\nkidding.”\n\n“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.\n\nSometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a\nbantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool\nas their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all\ndesire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a\npolite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew\nthat presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too\nwould be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the\nWest, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its\nclose, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer\nnervous dread of the moment itself.\n\n“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass\nof corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops or\nsomething?”\n\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in\nan unexpected way.\n\n“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve\ngotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise\nof the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”\n\n“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n\n“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is\nif we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly\nsubmerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”\n\n“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of\nunthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in\nthem. What was that word we—”\n\n“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her\nimpatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to\nus, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will\nhave control of things.”\n\n“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously\ntoward the fervent sun.\n\n“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom\ninterrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n\n“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are,\nand—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a\nslight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the\nthings that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all\nthat. Do you see?”\n\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his\ncomplacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.\nWhen, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler\nleft the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned\ntowards me.\n\n“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically.\n“It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler’s\nnose?”\n\n“That’s why I came over tonight.”\n\n“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher\nfor some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred\npeople. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it\nbegan to affect his nose—”\n\n“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.\n\n“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up\nhis position.”\n\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her\nglowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I\nlistened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering\nregret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\n\nThe butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear,\nwhereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went\ninside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned\nforward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n\n“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an\nabsolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:\n“An absolute rose?”\n\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only\nextemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart\nwas trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,\nthrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and\nexcused herself and went into the house.\n\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of\nmeaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!”\nin a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the\nroom beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to\nhear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,\nmounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n\n“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.\n\n“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”\n\n“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.\n\n“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.\n“I thought everybody knew.”\n\n“I don’t.”\n\n“Why—” she said hesitantly. “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”\n\n“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.\n\nMiss Baker nodded.\n\n“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time.\nDon’t you think?”\n\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a\ndress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at\nthe table.\n\n“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.\n\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and\ncontinued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic\noutdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a\nnightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing\naway—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”\n\n“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light\nenough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”\n\nThe telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head\ndecisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,\nvanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes\nat table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I\nwas conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to\navoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but\nI doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain\nhardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill\nmetallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation\nmight have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone\nimmediately for the police.\n\nThe horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss\nBaker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into\nthe library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,\ntrying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed\nDaisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In\nits deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\n\nDaisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and\nher eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that\nturbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be\nsome sedative questions about her little girl.\n\n“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even\nif we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”\n\n“I wasn’t back from the war.”\n\n“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick,\nand I’m pretty cynical about everything.”\n\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more,\nand after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her\ndaughter.\n\n“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”\n\n“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you\nwhat I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”\n\n“Very much.”\n\n“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was\nless than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of\nthe ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right\naway if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I\nturned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a\ngirl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be\nin this world, a beautiful little fool.’\n\n“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a\nconvinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I\nknow. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.”\nHer eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and\nshe laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’m\nsophisticated!”\n\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my\nbelief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me\nuneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to\nexact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a\nmoment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as\nif she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret\nsociety to which she and Tom belonged.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at\neither end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the\nSaturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running\ntogether in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and\ndull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as\nshe turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.\n\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n\n“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in\nour very next issue.”\n\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she\nstood up.\n\n“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the\nceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”\n\n“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy,\n“over at Westchester.”\n\n“Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”\n\nI knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous\nexpression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the\nsporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard\nsome story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I\nhad forgotten long ago.\n\n“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”\n\n“If you’ll get up.”\n\n“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”\n\n“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy. “In fact I think I’ll arrange a\nmarriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you\ntogether. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push\nyou out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”\n\n“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs. “I haven’t heard a\nword.”\n\n“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let\nher run around the country this way.”\n\n“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.\n\n“Her family.”\n\n“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s\ngoing to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots\nof weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be\nvery good for her.”\n\nDaisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\n\n“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.\n\n“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our\nbeautiful white—”\n\n“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?”\ndemanded Tom suddenly.\n\n“Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we\ntalked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept\nup on us and first thing you know—”\n\n“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.\n\nI said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes\nlater I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood\nside by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor\nDaisy peremptorily called: “Wait!”\n\n“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were\nengaged to a girl out West.”\n\n“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were\nengaged.”\n\n“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”\n\n“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again\nin a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be\ntrue.”\n\nOf course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even\nvaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one\nof the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old\nfriend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention\nof being rumoured into marriage.\n\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them less remotely\nrich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove\naway. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out\nof the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such\nintentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman\nin New York” was really less surprising than that he had been\ndepressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of\nstale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his\nperemptory heart.\n\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside\ngarages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and\nwhen I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and\nsat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had\nblown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the\ntrees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth\nblew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered\nacross the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I\nwas not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of\nmy neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets\nregarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely\nmovements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested\nthat it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was\nhis of our local heavens.\n\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and\nthat would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he\ngave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched\nout his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was\nfrom him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced\nseaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute\nand far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked\nonce more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the\nunquiet darkness.\n\n\n                         II\n\nAbout halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily\njoins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as\nto shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley\nof ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and\nhills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and\nchimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of\nash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery\nair. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track,\ngives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the\nash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable\ncloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.\n\nBut above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift\nendlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.\nJ. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and\ngigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face,\nbut, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass\nover a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set\nthem there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then\nsank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved\naway. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun\nand rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.\n\nThe valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and,\nwhen the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on\nwaiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an\nhour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was\nbecause of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.\n\nThe fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His\nacquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafés\nwith her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with\nwhomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire\nto meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one\nafternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet\nand, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.\n\n“We’re getting off,” he insisted. “I want you to meet my girl.”\n\nI think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination\nto have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption\nwas that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.\n\nI followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked\nback a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s\npersistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of\nyellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact\nMain Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing.\nOne of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an\nall-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a\ngarage—Repairs. George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold.—and I followed\nTom inside.\n\nThe interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the\ndust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had\noccurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that\nsumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the\nproprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands\non a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and\nfaintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his\nlight blue eyes.\n\n“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the\nshoulder. “How’s business?”\n\n“I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly. “When are you\ngoing to sell me that car?”\n\n“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”\n\n“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”\n\n“No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly. “And if you feel that way about it,\nmaybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.”\n\n“I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly. “I just meant—”\n\nHis voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage.\nThen I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish\nfigure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was\nin the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh\nsensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark\nblue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there\nwas an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of\nher body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking\nthrough her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom,\nlooking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without\nturning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:\n\n“Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”\n\n“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little\noffice, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A\nwhite ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled\neverything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.\n\n“I want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on the next train.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.”\n\nShe nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with\ntwo chairs from his office door.\n\nWe waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days\nbefore the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was\nsetting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.\n\n“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor\nEckleburg.\n\n“Awful.”\n\n“It does her good to get away.”\n\n“Doesn’t her husband object?”\n\n“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so\ndumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”\n\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not\nquite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom\ndeferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might\nbe on the train.\n\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched\ntight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in\nNew York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a\nmoving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream\nand a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive\nshe let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one,\nlavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from\nthe mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she\nturned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the\nfront glass.\n\n“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get\none for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”\n\nWe backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John\nD. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very\nrecent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n\n“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the\ntaxi-window.\n\n“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”\n\n“I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got\nthat kind?”\n\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and\ndrew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\n\n“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.\n\n“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment\nin his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the\nbrown washrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dog\nthat’ll never bother you with catching cold.”\n\n“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much is\nit?”\n\n“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you ten\ndollars.”\n\nThe Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it\nsomewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and\nsettled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the\nweatherproof coat with rapture.\n\n“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.\n\n“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”\n\n“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy\nten more dogs with it.”\n\nWe drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the\nsummer Sunday afternoon. I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great\nflock of white sheep turn the corner.\n\n“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”\n\n“No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly. “Myrtle’ll be hurt if you\ndon’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”\n\n“Come on,” she urged. “I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. She’s said\nto be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”\n\n“Well, I’d like to, but—”\n\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.\nAt 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of\napartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the\nneighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other\npurchases, and went haughtily in.\n\n“I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in\nthe elevator. “And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”\n\nThe apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small\ndining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded\nto the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for\nit, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of\nladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an\nover-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.\nLooked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a\nbonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the\nroom. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with\na copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines\nof Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant\nelevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he\nadded on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of\nwhich decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all\nafternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked\nbureau door.\n\nI have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that\nafternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it,\nalthough until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful\nsun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the\ntelephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some\nat the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both\ndisappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a\nchapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the\nwhisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.\n\nJust as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called\neach other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive\nat the apartment door.\n\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty,\nwith a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky\nwhite. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more\nrakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the\nold alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about\nthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets\njingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary\nhaste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I\nwondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed\nimmoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a\ngirl friend at a hotel.\n\nMr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just\nshaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he\nwas most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He\ninformed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later\nthat he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of\nMrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His\nwife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with\npride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven\ntimes since they had been married.\n\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now\nattired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,\nwhich gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With\nthe influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a\nchange. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage\nwas converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her\nassertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she\nexpanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be\nrevolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.\n\n“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of\nthese fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I\nhad a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me\nthe bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”\n\n“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs. McKee.\n\n“Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own\nhomes.”\n\n“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”\n\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.\n\n“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes\nwhen I don’t care what I look like.”\n\n“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs.\nMcKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could\nmake something of it.”\n\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair\nfrom over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr.\nMcKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved\nhis hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.\n\n“I should change the light,” he said after a moment. “I’d like to\nbring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold of\nall the back hair.”\n\n“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think\nit’s—”\n\nHer husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again,\nwhereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.\n\n“You McKees have something to drink,” he said. “Get some more ice and\nmineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”\n\n“I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair\nat the shiftlessness of the lower orders. “These people! You have to\nkeep after them all the time.”\n\nShe looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to\nthe dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying\nthat a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.\n\n“I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.\n\nTom looked at him blankly.\n\n“Two of them we have framed downstairs.”\n\n“Two what?” demanded Tom.\n\n“Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the\nother I call Montauk Point—The Sea.”\n\nThe sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.\n\n“Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired.\n\n“I live at West Egg.”\n\n“Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named\nGatsby’s. Do you know him?”\n\n“I live next door to him.”\n\n“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s\nwhere all his money comes from.”\n\n“Really?”\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”\n\nThis absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs.\nMcKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:\n\n“Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but\nMr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.\n\n“I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry.\nAll I ask is that they should give me a start.”\n\n“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as\nMrs. Wilson entered with a tray. “She’ll give you a letter of\nintroduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”\n\n“Do what?” she asked, startled.\n\n“You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can\ndo some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he\ninvented, “ ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like\nthat.”\n\nCatherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:\n\n“Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”\n\n“Can’t they?”\n\n“Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. “What I say\nis, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them? If I was them\nI’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”\n\n“Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”\n\nThe answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle, who had\noverheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.\n\n“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again.\n“It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart. She’s a Catholic, and\nthey don’t believe in divorce.”\n\nDaisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the\nelaborateness of the lie.\n\n“When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going West\nto live for a while until it blows over.”\n\n“It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”\n\n“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly. “I just got back\nfrom Monte Carlo.”\n\n“Really.”\n\n“Just last year. I went over there with another girl.”\n\n“Stay long?”\n\n“No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of\nMarseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we\ngot gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an\nawful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!”\n\nThe late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the\nblue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee\ncalled me back into the room.\n\n“I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously. “I almost\nmarried a little kike who’d been after me for years. I knew he was\nbelow me. Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below\nyou!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”\n\n“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,\n“at least you didn’t marry him.”\n\n“I know I didn’t.”\n\n“Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously. “And that’s the\ndifference between your case and mine.”\n\n“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine. “Nobody forced you to.”\n\nMyrtle considered.\n\n“I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she said\nfinally. “I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t\nfit to lick my shoe.”\n\n“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.\n\n“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously. “Who said I was crazy\nabout him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that\nman there.”\n\nShe pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I\ntried to show by my expression that I expected no affection.\n\n“The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made\na mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and\nnever even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he\nwas out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said. ‘This is the first I ever\nheard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to\nbeat the band all afternoon.”\n\n“She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me.\n“They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom’s the\nfirst sweetie she ever had.”\n\nThe bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by all\npresent, excepting Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing at\nall.” Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated\nsandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to\nget out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight,\nbut each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident\nargument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet\nhigh over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed\ntheir share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening\nstreets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and\nwithout, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible\nvariety of life.\n\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath\npoured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n\n“It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the\nlast ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my\nsister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather\nshoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked\nat me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his\nhead. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white\nshirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call\na policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into\na taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway\ntrain. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live\nforever; you can’t live forever.’ ”\n\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial\nlaughter.\n\n“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m\nthrough with it. I’ve got to get another one tomorrow. I’m going to\nmake a list of all the things I’ve got to get. A massage and a wave,\nand a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where\nyou touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s\ngrave that’ll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won’t\nforget all the things I got to do.”\n\nIt was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch\nand found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists\nclenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out\nmy handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that\nhad worried me all the afternoon.\n\nThe little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes\nthrough the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People\ndisappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost\neach other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet\naway. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood\nface to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson\nhad any right to mention Daisy’s name.\n\n“Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!” shouted Mrs. Wilson. “I’ll say it whenever I\nwant to! Daisy! Dai—”\n\nMaking a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his\nopen hand.\n\nThen there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’s\nvoices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of\npain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the\ndoor. When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the\nscene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled\nhere and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and\nthe despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to\nspread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of\nVersailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door.\nTaking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.\n\n“Come to lunch some day,” he suggested, as we groaned down in the\nelevator.\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Anywhere.”\n\n“Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the elevator boy.\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. McKee with dignity, “I didn’t know I was\ntouching it.”\n\n“All right,” I agreed, “I’ll be glad to.”\n\n… I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the\nsheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.\n\n“Beauty and the Beast … Loneliness … Old Grocery Horse … Brook’n\nBridge …”\n\nThen I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the\nPennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting for\nthe four o’clock train.\n\n\n                        III\n\nThere was music from my neighbour’s house through the summer nights.\nIn his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the\nwhisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the\nafternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or\ntaking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats\nslit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of\nfoam. On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties\nto and from the city between nine in the morning and long past\nmidnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to\nmeet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra\ngardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers\nand garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.\n\nEvery Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a\nfruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left\nhis back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in\nthe kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in\nhalf an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a\nbutler’s thumb.\n\nAt least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several\nhundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas\ntree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with\nglistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of\nharlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark\ngold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and\nstocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that\nmost of his female guests were too young to know one from another.\n\nBy seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair,\nbut a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and\ncornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have\ncome in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from\nNew York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and\nsalons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in\nstrange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is\nin full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden\noutside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual\ninnuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic\nmeetings between women who never knew each other’s names.\n\nThe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and\nnow the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of\nvoices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute,\nspilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups\nchange more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the\nsame breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave\nhere and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,\njoyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph,\nglide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under\nthe constantly changing light.\n\nSuddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail\nout of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like\nFrisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the\norchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a\nburst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda\nGray’s understudy from the Follies. The party has begun.\n\nI believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was one\nof the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not\ninvited—they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out\nto Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door. Once there\nthey were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they\nconducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated\nwith an amusement park. Sometimes they came and went without having\nmet Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that\nwas its own ticket of admission.\n\nI had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-egg\nblue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly\nformal note from his employer: the honour would be entirely Gatsby’s,\nit said, if I would attend his “little party” that night. He had seen\nme several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a\npeculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay\nGatsby, in a majestic hand.\n\nDressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after\nseven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies\nof people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticed\non the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of\nyoung Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little\nhungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous\nAmericans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or\ninsurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the\neasy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few\nwords in the right key.\n\nAs soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or\nthree people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an\namazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements,\nthat I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place\nin the garden where a single man could linger without looking\npurposeless and alone.\n\nI was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when\nJordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble\nsteps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous\ninterest down into the garden.\n\nWelcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone\nbefore I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby.\n\n“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally\nloud across the garden.\n\n“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up.\n“I remembered you lived next door to—”\n\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me\nin a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who\nstopped at the foot of the steps.\n\n“Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry you didn’t win.”\n\nThat was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week\nbefore.\n\n“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we\nmet you here about a month ago.”\n\n“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started,\nbut the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to\nthe premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a\ncaterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we\ndescended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of\ncocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a\ntable with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced\nto us as Mr. Mumble.\n\n“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl\nbeside her.\n\n“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an\nalert confident voice. She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for\nyou, Lucille?”\n\nIt was for Lucille, too.\n\n“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I always\nhave a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and\nhe asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from\nCroirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”\n\n“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.\n\n“Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the\nbust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two\nhundred and sixty-five dollars.”\n\n“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,”\nsaid the other girl eagerly. “He doesn’t want any trouble with\nanybody.”\n\n“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.\n\n“Gatsby. Somebody told me—”\n\nThe two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.\n\n“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”\n\nA thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and\nlistened eagerly.\n\n“I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’s\nmore that he was a German spy during the war.”\n\nOne of the men nodded in confirmation.\n\n“I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in\nGermany,” he assured us positively.\n\n“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in\nthe American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to\nher she leaned forward with enthusiasm. “You look at him sometimes\nwhen he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.”\n\nShe narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned\nand looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic\nspeculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those\nwho had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this\nworld.\n\nThe first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now\nbeing served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were\nspread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were\nthree married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate\ngiven to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that\nsooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a\ngreater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had\npreserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function\nof representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg\ncondescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its\nspectroscopic gaiety.\n\n“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and\ninappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”\n\nWe got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I\nhad never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The\nundergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\n\nThe bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not\nthere. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t\non the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and\nwalked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak,\nand probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.\n\nA stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was\nsitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with\nunsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he\nwheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.\n\n“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.\n\n“About what?”\n\nHe waved his hand toward the bookshelves.\n\n“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I\nascertained. They’re real.”\n\n“The books?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice\ndurable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real.  Pages\nand—Here! Lemme show you.”\n\nTaking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and\nreturned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.\n\n“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed\nmatter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a\ntriumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop,\ntoo—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”\n\nHe snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf,\nmuttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable\nto collapse.\n\n“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you just come? I was brought.\nMost people were brought.”\n\nJordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.\n\n“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. Claud\nRoosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve been\ndrunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit\nin a library.”\n\n“Has it?”\n\n“A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an hour.\nDid I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—”\n\n“You told us.”\n\nWe shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.\n\nThere was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing\nyoung girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples\nholding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the\ncorners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually or\nrelieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the\ntraps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had\nsung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and\nbetween the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden,\nwhile happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A\npair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a\nbaby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than\nfinger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was\na triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny\ndrip of the banjoes on the lawn.\n\nI was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man\nof about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the\nslightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying\nmyself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene\nhad changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and\nprofound.\n\nAt a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.\n\n“Your face is familiar,” he said politely. “Weren’t you in the First\nDivision during the war?”\n\n“Why yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.”\n\n“I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen\nyou somewhere before.”\n\nWe talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.\nEvidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just\nbought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.\n\n“Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”\n\n“What time?”\n\n“Any time that suits you best.”\n\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked\naround and smiled.\n\n“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.\n\n“Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is an\nunusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over\nthere—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and\nthis man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”\n\nFor a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.\n\n“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.\n\n“What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your pardon.”\n\n“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”\n\nHe smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one\nof those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that\nyou may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to\nface—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on\nyou with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you\njust so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you\nwould like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had\nprecisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to\nconvey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an\nelegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate\nformality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he\nintroduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his\nwords with care.\n\nAlmost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler\nhurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him\non the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of\nus in turn.\n\n“If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me.\n“Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”\n\nWhen he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure\nher of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid\nand corpulent person in his middle years.\n\n“Who is he?” I demanded. “Do you know?”\n\n“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”\n\n“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”\n\n“Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile.\n“Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.”\n\nA dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next\nremark it faded away.\n\n“However, I don’t believe it.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”\n\nSomething in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he\nkilled a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would\nhave accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from\nthe swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That\nwas comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial\ninexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and\nbuy a palace on Long Island Sound.\n\n“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject\nwith an urban distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties.\nThey’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”\n\nThere was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra\nleader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are\ngoing to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which\nattracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the\npapers you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial\ncondescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody\nlaughed.\n\n“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s\nJazz History of the World!’ ”\n\nThe nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it\nbegan my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and\nlooking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin\nwas drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as\nthough it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about\nhim. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him\noff from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as\nthe fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the World”\nwas over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a\npuppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into\nmen’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their\nfalls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched\nGatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s\nhead for one link.\n\n“I beg your pardon.”\n\nGatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.\n\n“Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would\nlike to speak to you alone.”\n\n“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.\n\n“Yes, madame.”\n\nShe got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and\nfollowed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her\nevening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a\njauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk\nupon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\n\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and\nintriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which\noverhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now\nengaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who\nimplored me to join him, I went inside.\n\nThe large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was\nplaying the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady\nfrom a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of\nchampagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly,\nthat everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was\nweeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with\ngasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering\nsoprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for\nwhen they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they\nassumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow\nblack rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes\non her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and\nwent off into a deep vinous sleep.\n\n“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a\ngirl at my elbow.\n\nI looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights\nwith men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet\nfrom East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was\ntalking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after\nattempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent\nway, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals\nshe appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed:\n“You promised!” into his ear.\n\nThe reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall\nwas at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly\nindignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in\nslightly raised voices.\n\n“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.”\n\n“Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”\n\n“We’re always the first ones to leave.”\n\n“So are we.”\n\n“Well, we’re almost the last tonight,” said one of the men sheepishly.\n“The orchestra left half an hour ago.”\n\nIn spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond\ncredibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives\nwere lifted, kicking, into the night.\n\nAs I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and\nJordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last\nword to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into\nformality as several people approached him to say goodbye.\n\nJordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she\nlingered for a moment to shake hands.\n\n“I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,” she whispered. “How long\nwere we in there?”\n\n“Why, about an hour.”\n\n“It was … simply amazing,” she repeated abstractedly. “But I swore I\nwouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.” She yawned gracefully\nin my face. “Please come and see me … Phone book … Under the name of\nMrs. Sigourney Howard … My aunt …” She was hurrying off as she\ntalked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her\nparty at the door.\n\nRather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I\njoined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him. I\nwanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to\napologize for not having known him in the garden.\n\n“Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly. “Don’t give it another\nthought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiarity\nthan the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. “And don’t\nforget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine\no’clock.”\n\nThen the butler, behind his shoulder:\n\n“Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.”\n\n“All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll be right there … Good night.”\n\n“Good night.”\n\n“Good night.” He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant\nsignificance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired\nit all the time. “Good night, old sport … Good night.”\n\nBut as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite\nover. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a\nbizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side\nup, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had\nleft Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall\naccounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting\nconsiderable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However,\nas they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din\nfrom those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to\nthe already violent confusion of the scene.\n\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in\nthe middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the\ntyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\n\n“See!” he explained. “It went in the ditch.”\n\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the\nunusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of\nGatsby’s library.\n\n“How’d it happen?”\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.\n\n“But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?”\n\n“Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole\nmatter. “I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It\nhappened, and that’s all I know.”\n\n“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”\n\n“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even\ntrying.”\n\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\n\n“Do you want to commit suicide?”\n\n“You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!”\n\n“You don’t understand,” explained the criminal. “I wasn’t driving.\nThere’s another man in the car.”\n\nThe shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained\n“Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was\nnow a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened\nwide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a\npale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively\nat the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\n\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant\ngroaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment\nbefore he perceived the man in the duster.\n\n“Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “Did we run outa gas?”\n\n“Look!”\n\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it\nfor a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it\nhad dropped from the sky.\n\n“It came off,” someone explained.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”\n\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders,\nhe remarked in a determined voice:\n\n“Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”\n\nAt least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was,\nexplained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any\nphysical bond.\n\n“Back out,” he suggested after a moment. “Put her in reverse.”\n\n“But the wheel’s off!”\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n“No harm in trying,” he said.\n\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and\ncut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a\nmoon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before,\nand surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.\nA sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great\ndoors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who\nstood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the\nimpression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were\nall that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events\nin a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me\ninfinitely less than my personal affairs.\n\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my\nshadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York\nto the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen\nby their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded\nrestaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I\neven had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and\nworked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing\nmean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I\nlet it blow quietly away.\n\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the\ngloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and\nstudied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There\nwere generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the\nlibrary, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was\nmellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel,\nand over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\n\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night,\nand the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and\nmachines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue\nand pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few\nminutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever\nknow or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their\napartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and\nsmiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm\ndarkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting\nloneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who\nloitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary\nrestaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant\nmoments of night and life.\n\nAgain at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined\nfive deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I\nfelt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they\nwaited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes,\nand lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining\nthat I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate\nexcitement, I wished them well.\n\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I\nfound her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her,\nbecause she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it\nwas something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of\ntender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world\nconcealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually,\neven though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it\nwas. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a\nborrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about\nit—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me\nthat night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a\nrow that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved\nher ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached\nthe proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his\nstatement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been\nmistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\n\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw\nthat this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence\nfrom a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.\nShe wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this\nunwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she\nwas very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to\nthe world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.\n\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you\nnever blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on\nthat same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving\na car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our\nfender flicked a button on one man’s coat.\n\n“You’re a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you ought to be more\ncareful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”\n\n“I am careful.”\n\n“No, you’re not.”\n\n“Well, other people are,” she said lightly.\n\n“What’s that got to do with it?”\n\n“They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It takes two to make an\naccident.”\n\n“Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.”\n\n“I hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate careless people. That’s\nwhy I like you.”\n\nHer grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had\ndeliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved\nher. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as\nbrakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself\ndefinitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once\na week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was\nhow, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of\nperspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague\nunderstanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.\n\nEveryone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and\nthis is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever\nknown.\n\n\n                         IV\n\nOn Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore,\nthe world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled\nhilariously on his lawn.\n\n“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between\nhis cocktails and his flowers. “One time he killed a man who had found\nout that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the\ndevil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there\ncrystal glass.”\n\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of\nthose who came to Gatsby’s house that summer. It is an old timetable\nnow, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect\nJuly 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the grey names, and they will\ngive you a better impression than my generalities of those who\naccepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of\nknowing nothing whatever about him.\n\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a\nman named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who\nwas drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie\nVoltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a\ncorner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came\nnear. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and\nMr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned\ncotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\n\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once,\nin white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the\ngarden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O.\nR. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the\nFishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he\nwent to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that\nMrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies\ncame, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice\nA. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and\nBeluga’s girls.\n\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and\nCecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who\ncontrolled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don\nS. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the\nmovies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.\nEarl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his\nwife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.\n(“Rot-Gut”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to\ngamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was\ncleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably\nnext day.\n\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as\n“the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people\nthere were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George\nDuckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the\nBackhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and\nthe Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the\nSmirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who\nkilled himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.\n\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite\nthe same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with\nanother that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have\nforgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria\nor Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names\nof flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American\ncapitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves\nto be.\n\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came\nthere at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had\nhis nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag,\nhis fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of\nthe American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be\nher chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and\nwhose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\n\nAll these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car\nlurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody\nfrom its three-noted horn.\n\nIt was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of\nhis parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation,\nmade frequent use of his beach.\n\n“Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me today and I\nthought we’d ride up together.”\n\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that\nresourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes,\nI suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more,\nwith the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality\nwas continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape\nof restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping\nfoot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\n\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n\n“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off to give me a better\nview. “Haven’t you ever seen it before?”\n\nI’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright\nwith nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with\ntriumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with\na labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down\nbehind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory,\nwe started to town.\n\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and\nfound, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first\nimpression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had\ngradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an\nelaborate roadhouse next door.\n\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t reached West Egg\nvillage before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished\nand slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured\nsuit.\n\n“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly, “what’s your\nopinion of me, anyhow?”\n\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that\nquestion deserves.\n\n“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted.\n“I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you\nhear.”\n\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation\nin his halls.\n\n“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine\nretribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in the\nMiddle West—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at\nOxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many\nyears. It is a family tradition.”\n\nHe looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he\nwas lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed\nit, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with\nthis doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if\nthere wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.\n\n“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.\n\n“San Francisco.”\n\n“I see.”\n\n“My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”\n\nHis voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a\nclan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling\nmy leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n\n“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of\nEurope—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting\nbig game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to\nforget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”\n\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very\nphrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that\nof a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued\na tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\n\n“Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very\nhard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a\ncommission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I\ntook the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there\nwas a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t\nadvance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty\nmen with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last\nthey found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of\ndead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave\nme a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the\nAdriatic Sea!”\n\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his\nsmile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and\nsympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It\nappreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had\nelicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart. My\nincredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming\nhastily through a dozen magazines.\n\nHe reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon,\nfell into my palm.\n\n“That’s the one from Montenegro.”\n\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. “Orderi di\nDanilo,” ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”\n\n“Turn it.”\n\n“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”\n\n“Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It\nwas taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of\nDoncaster.”\n\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an\narchway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,\nlooking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.\n\nThen it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace\non the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with\ntheir crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\n\n“I’m going to make a big request of you today,” he said, pocketing his\nsouvenirs with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought to know something\nabout me. I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,\nI usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there\ntrying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” He hesitated.\n“You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”\n\n“At lunch?”\n\n“No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss\nBaker to tea.”\n\n“Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”\n\n“No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak\nto you about this matter.”\n\nI hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was more\nannoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to\ndiscuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something\nutterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon\nhis overpopulated lawn.\n\nHe wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared\nthe city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of\nred-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with\nthe dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds.\nThen the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a\nglimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting\nvitality as we went by.\n\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half\nAstoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated\nI heard the familiar “jug-jug-spat!” of a motorcycle, and a frantic\npoliceman rode alongside.\n\n“All right, old sport,” called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white\ncard from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes.\n\n“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. “Know you next\ntime, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!”\n\n“What was that?” I inquired. “The picture of Oxford?”\n\n“I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a\nChristmas card every year.”\n\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a\nconstant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across\nthe river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of\nnonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always\nthe city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the\nmystery and the beauty in the world.\n\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two\ncarriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for\nfriends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short\nupper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of\nGatsby’s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we\ncrossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white\nchauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I\nlaughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in\nhaughty rivalry.\n\n“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought;\n“anything at all …”\n\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRoaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby\nfor lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes\npicked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\n\n“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.”\n\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two\nfine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a\nmoment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.\n\n“—So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand\nearnestly, “and what do you think I did?”\n\n“What?” I inquired politely.\n\nBut evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and\ncovered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\n\n“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh,\ndon’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and\nthere.”\n\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the\nrestaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was\nstarting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\n\n“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.\n\n“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the\npresbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. “But I like across the street\nbetter!”\n\n“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’s too\nhot over there.”\n\n“Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full of memories.”\n\n“What place is that?” I asked.\n\n“The old Metropole.”\n\n“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. “Filled with\nfaces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’t\nforget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It\nwas six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all\nevening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a\nfunny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. ‘All\nright,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his\nchair.\n\n“ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t\nyou, so help me, move outside this room.’\n\n“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the\nblinds we’d of seen daylight.”\n\n“Did he go?” I asked innocently.\n\n“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly. “He\nturned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away\nmy coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three\ntimes in his full belly and drove away.”\n\n“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.\n\n“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.\n“I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”\n\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered\nfor me:\n\n“Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”\n\n“No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.\n\n“This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about that some other\ntime.”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”\n\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more\nsentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with\nferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around\nthe room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people\ndirectly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have\ntaken one short glance beneath our own table.\n\n“Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid I\nmade you a little angry this morning in the car.”\n\nThere was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.\n\n“I don’t like mysteries,” I answered, “and I don’t understand why you\nwon’t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got\nto come through Miss Baker?”\n\n“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me. “Miss Baker’s a great\nsportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all\nright.”\n\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room,\nleaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.\n\n“He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his\neyes. “Fine fellow, isn’t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect\ngentleman.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“He’s an Oggsford man.”\n\n“Oh!”\n\n“He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?”\n\n“I’ve heard of it.”\n\n“It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”\n\n“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired.\n\n“Several years,” he answered in a gratified way. “I made the pleasure\nof his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a\nman of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to\nmyself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce\nto your mother and sister.’ ” He paused. “I see you’re looking at my\ncuff buttons.”\n\nI hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of\noddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n\n“Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.\n\n“Well!” I inspected them. “That’s a very interesting idea.”\n\n“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’s very\ncareful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’s\nwife.”\n\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and\nsat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his\nfeet.\n\n“I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you\ntwo young men before I outstay my welcome.”\n\n“Don’t hurry Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem\nraised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n\n“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced\nsolemnly. “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies\nand your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his\nhand. “As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on\nyou any longer.”\n\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I\nwondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n\n“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This is\none of his sentimental days. He’s quite a character around New York—a\ndenizen of Broadway.”\n\n“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“A dentist?”\n\n“Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added,\ncoolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”\n\n“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.\n\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World’s\nSeries had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I\nwould have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of\nsome inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could\nstart to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the\nsingle-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.\n\n“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute.\n\n“He just saw the opportunity.”\n\n“Why isn’t he in jail?”\n\n“They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.”\n\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I\ncaught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.\n\n“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello to\nsomeone.”\n\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our\ndirection.\n\n“Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly. “Daisy’s furious because you\nhaven’t called up.”\n\n“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”\n\nThey shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of\nembarrassment came over Gatsby’s face.\n\n“How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of me. “How’d you happen to\ncome up this far to eat?”\n\n“I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”\n\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne October day in nineteen-seventeen—\n\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a\nstraight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\n\n—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks\nand half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on\nshoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the\nsoft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the\nwind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in\nfront of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut,\nin a disapproving way.\n\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to\nDaisy Fay’s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and\nby far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She\ndressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long\nthe telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp\nTaylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that\nnight. “Anyways, for an hour!”\n\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was\nbeside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had\nnever seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she\ndidn’t see me until I was five feet away.\n\n“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. “Please come here.”\n\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the\nolder girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red\nCross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she\ncouldn’t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was\nspeaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at\nsometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the\nincident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on\nhim again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I\ndidn’t realize it was the same man.\n\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux\nmyself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very\noften. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone\nat all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had\nfound her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say\ngoodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually\nprevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for\nseveral weeks. After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any\nmore, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town,\nwho couldn’t get into the army at all.\n\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a début\nafter the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a\nman from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago,\nwith more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He\ncame down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a\nwhole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he\ngave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand\ndollars.\n\nI was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the\nbridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June\nnight in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle\nof Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n\n“ ’Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never had a drink before, but oh how\nI do enjoy it.”\n\n“What’s the matter, Daisy?”\n\nI was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before.\n\n“Here, dearies.” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her\non the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. “Take ’em downstairs\nand give ’em back to whoever they belong to. Tell ’em all Daisy’s\nchange’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’ ”\n\nShe began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her\nmother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath.\nShe wouldn’t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her\nand squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the\nsoap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\n\nBut she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and\nput ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half\nan hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around\nher neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o’clock she\nmarried Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a\nthree months’ trip to the South Seas.\n\nI saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I’d\nnever seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a\nminute she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” and\nwear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the\ndoor. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the\nhour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with\nunfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you\nlaugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I\nleft Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night,\nand ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got\ninto the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the\nchambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.\n\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for\na year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and\nthen they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in\nChicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young\nand rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect\nreputation. Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantage\nnot to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and,\nmoreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that\neverybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy\nnever went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice\nof hers …\n\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first\ntime in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew\nGatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and\nwoke me up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him—I was\nhalf asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man\nshe used to know. It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsby\nwith the officer in her white car.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza\nfor half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park.\nThe sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in\nthe West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered\nlike crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:\n\n“I’m the Sheik of Araby. Your love belongs to me. At night when\nyou’re asleep Into your tent I’ll creep—”\n\n“It was a strange coincidence,” I said.\n\n“But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.”\n\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that\nJune night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of\nhis purposeless splendour.\n\n“He wants to know,” continued Jordan, “if you’ll invite Daisy to your\nhouse some afternoon and then let him come over.”\n\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and\nbought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that\nhe could “come over” some afternoon to a stranger’s garden.\n\n“Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?”\n\n“He’s afraid, he’s waited so long. He thought you might be\noffended. You see, he’s regular tough underneath it all.”\n\nSomething worried me.\n\n“Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?”\n\n“He wants her to see his house,” she explained. “And your house is\nright next door.”\n\n“Oh!”\n\n“I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some\nnight,” went on Jordan, “but she never did. Then he began asking\npeople casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It\nwas that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard\nthe elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately\nsuggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:\n\n“ ‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’ he kept saying. ‘I\nwant to see her right next door.’\n\n“When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s, he started to\nabandon the whole idea. He doesn’t know very much about Tom, though he\nsays he’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of\ncatching a glimpse of Daisy’s name.”\n\nIt was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm\naround Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her\nto dinner. Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more,\nbut of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal\nscepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my\narm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady\nexcitement: “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and\nthe tired.”\n\n“And Daisy ought to have something in her life,” murmured Jordan to\nme.\n\n“Does she want to see Gatsby?”\n\n“She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t want her to know. You’re\njust supposed to invite her to tea.”\n\nWe passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of Fifty-Ninth\nStreet, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.\nUnlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face\nfloated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up\nthe girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth\nsmiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.\n\n\n                         V\n\nWhen I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that\nmy house was on fire. Two o’clock and the whole corner of the\npeninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery\nand made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a\ncorner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.\n\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved\nitself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the\nhouse thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only wind in\nthe trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on\nagain as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned\naway I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\n\n“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.\n\n“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have been\nglancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, old\nsport. In my car.”\n\n“It’s too late.”\n\n“Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t made\nuse of it all summer.”\n\n“I’ve got to go to bed.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\n\n“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment. “I’m going to call\nup Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.”\n\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put you\nto any trouble.”\n\n“What day would suit you?”\n\n“What day would suit you?” he corrected me quickly. “I don’t want to\nput you to any trouble, you see.”\n\n“How about the day after tomorrow?”\n\nHe considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: “I want to get the\ngrass cut,” he said.\n\nWe both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my\nragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I\nsuspected that he meant my grass.\n\n“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\n\n“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—” He fumbled with a series of\nbeginnings. “Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make\nmuch money, do you?”\n\n“Not very much.”\n\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\n\n“I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a\nlittle business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And\nI thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds,\naren’t you, old sport?”\n\n“Trying to.”\n\n“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much of your time\nand you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather\nconfidential sort of thing.”\n\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation\nmight have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer\nwas obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no\nchoice except to cut him off there.\n\n“I’ve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much obliged but I couldn’t\ntake on any more work.”\n\n“You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.” Evidently he\nthought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at\nlunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer,\nhoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be\nresponsive, so he went unwillingly home.\n\nThe evening had made me lightheaded and happy; I think I walked into a\ndeep sleep as I entered my front door. So I don’t know whether or not\nGatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into\nrooms” while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the\noffice next morning, and invited her to come to tea.\n\n“Don’t bring Tom,” I warned her.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Don’t bring Tom.”\n\n“Who is ‘Tom’?” she asked innocently.\n\nThe day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o’clock a man in a\nraincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that\nMr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I\nhad forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg\nVillage to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy\nsome cups and lemons and flowers.\n\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived\nfrom Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour\nlater the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel\nsuit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in. He was pale,\nand there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\n\n“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.\n\n“The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”\n\n“What grass?” he inquired blankly. “Oh, the grass in the yard.” He\nlooked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t\nbelieve he saw a thing.\n\n“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely. “One of the papers said they\nthought the rain would stop about four. I think it was The\nJournal. Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?”\n\nI took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at\nthe Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the\ndelicatessen shop.\n\n“Will they do?” I asked.\n\n“Of course, of course! They’re fine!” and he added hollowly, “… old\nsport.”\n\nThe rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which\noccasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes\nthrough a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that\nshook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from\ntime to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were\ntaking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in an\nuncertain voice, that he was going home.\n\n“Why’s that?”\n\n“Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!” He looked at his watch as if\nthere was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. “I can’t wait\nall day.”\n\n“Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”\n\nHe sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously\nthere was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped\nup, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.\n\nUnder the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the\ndrive. It stopped. Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a\nthree-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic\nsmile.\n\n“Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?”\n\nThe exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I\nhad to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear\nalone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a\ndash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with\nglistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.\n\n“Are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did I have\nto come alone?”\n\n“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far\naway and spend an hour.”\n\n“Come back in an hour, Ferdie.” Then in a grave murmur: “His name is\nFerdie.”\n\n“Does the gasoline affect his nose?”\n\n“I don’t think so,” she said innocently. “Why?”\n\nWe went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.\n\n“Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed.\n\n“What’s funny?”\n\nShe turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the\nfront door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his\nhands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a\npuddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.\n\nWith his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the\nhall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the\nliving-room. It wasn’t a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my\nown heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.\n\nFor half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then from the living-room I\nheard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by\nDaisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:\n\n“I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.”\n\nA pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I\nwent into the room.\n\nGatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the\nmantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of\nboredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face\nof a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraught\neyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful,\non the edge of a stiff chair.\n\n“We’ve met before,” muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at\nme, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily\nthe clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his\nhead, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and\nset it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm\nof the sofa and his chin in his hand.\n\n“I’m sorry about the clock,” he said.\n\nMy own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn’t muster up\na single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.\n\n“It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.\n\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on\nthe floor.\n\n“We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as\nmatter-of-fact as it could ever be.\n\n“Five years next November.”\n\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least\nanother minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate\nsuggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac\nFinn brought it in on a tray.\n\nAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical\ndecency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and,\nwhile Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other\nof us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end in\nitself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my\nfeet.\n\n“Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\n\n“I’ll be back.”\n\n“I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.”\n\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and\nwhispered: “Oh, God!” in a miserable way.\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\n“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to\nside, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”\n\n“You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’s\nembarrassed too.”\n\n“She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.\n\n“Just as much as you are.”\n\n“Don’t talk so loud.”\n\n“You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently. “Not only\nthat, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.”\n\nHe raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable\nreproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other\nroom.\n\nI walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his\nnervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge\nblack knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the\nrain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by\nGatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric\nmarshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except\nGatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church\nsteeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the “period”\ncraze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay\nfive years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would\nhave their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the\nheart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate\ndecline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on\nthe door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have\nalways been obstinate about being peasantry.\n\nAfter half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobile\nrounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’\ndinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening\nthe upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and,\nleaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the\ngarden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had\nseemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little\nnow and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that\nsilence had fallen within the house too.\n\nI went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of\npushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound. They\nwere sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if\nsome question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of\nembarrassment was gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when\nI came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief\nbefore a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply\nconfounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of\nexultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little\nroom.\n\n“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years. I\nthought for a moment he was going to shake hands.\n\n“It’s stopped raining.”\n\n“Has it?” When he realized what I was talking about, that there were\ntwinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,\nlike an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to\nDaisy. “What do you think of that? It’s stopped raining.”\n\n“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told\nonly of her unexpected joy.\n\n“I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to\nshow her around.”\n\n“You’re sure you want me to come?”\n\n“Absolutely, old sport.”\n\nDaisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with\nhumiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.\n\n“My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded. “See how the whole\nfront of it catches the light.”\n\nI agreed that it was splendid.\n\n“Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. “It\ntook me just three years to earn the money that bought it.”\n\n“I thought you inherited your money.”\n\n“I did, old sport,” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in\nthe big panic—the panic of the war.”\n\nI think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what\nbusiness he was in he answered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized\nthat it wasn’t an appropriate reply.\n\n“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected himself. “I was in the\ndrug business and then I was in the oil business. But I’m not in\neither one now.” He looked at me with more attention. “Do you mean\nyou’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?”\n\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of\nbrass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.\n\n“That huge place there?” she cried pointing.\n\n“Do you like it?”\n\n“I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”\n\n“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People\nwho do interesting things. Celebrated people.”\n\nInstead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the\nroad and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy\nadmired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky,\nadmired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy\nodour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of\nkiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find\nno stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but\nbird voices in the trees.\n\nAnd inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and\nRestoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind\nevery couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we\nhad passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College\nLibrary” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into\nghostly laughter.\n\nWe went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender\nsilk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms,\nand bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a\ndishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It\nwas Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily\nabout the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby’s own\napartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we sat\ndown and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in\nthe wall.\n\nHe hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued\neverything in his house according to the measure of response it drew\nfrom her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his\npossessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding\npresence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a\nflight of stairs.\n\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was\ngarnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush\nwith delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and\nshaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n\n“It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously. “I\ncan’t—When I try to—”\n\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a\nthird. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed\nwith wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long,\ndreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to\nspeak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction,\nhe was running down like an over-wound clock.\n\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent\ncabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and\nhis shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\n\n“I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a\nselection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”\n\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one,\nbefore us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel,\nwhich lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in\nmany-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft\nrich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in\ncoral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of\nindian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into\nthe shirts and began to cry stormily.\n\n“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the\nthick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such\nbeautiful shirts before.”\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and\nthe hydroplane, and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window\nit began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated\nsurface of the Sound.\n\n“If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,”\nsaid Gatsby. “You always have a green light that burns all night at\nthe end of your dock.”\n\nDaisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what\nhe had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal\nsignificance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the\ngreat distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very\nnear to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to\nthe moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of\nenchanted objects had diminished by one.\n\nI began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects\nin the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting\ncostume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.\n\n“Who’s this?”\n\n“That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”\n\nThe name sounded faintly familiar.\n\n“He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”\n\nThere was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the\nbureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently\nwhen he was about eighteen.\n\n“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told me you\nhad a pompadour—or a yacht.”\n\n“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly. “Here’s a lot of clippings—about\nyou.”\n\nThey stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the\nrubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.\n\n“Yes … Well, I can’t talk now … I can’t talk now, old sport … I said a\nsmall town … He must know what a small town is … Well, he’s no use to\nus if Detroit is his idea of a small town …”\n\nHe rang off.\n\n“Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the window.\n\nThe rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,\nand there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.\n\n“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to\njust get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you\naround.”\n\nI tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence\nmade them feel more satisfactorily alone.\n\n“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the\npiano.”\n\nHe went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutes\naccompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with\nshell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently\nclothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and duck\ntrousers of a nebulous hue.\n\n“Did we interrupt your exercise?” inquired Daisy politely.\n\n“I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.\n“That is, I’d been asleep. Then I got up …”\n\n“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off. “Don’t\nyou, Ewing, old sport?”\n\n“I don’t play well. I don’t—hardly play at all. I’m all out of prac—”\n\n“We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The\ngrey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.\n\nIn the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano.\nHe lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her\non a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the\ngleaming floor bounced in from the hall.\n\nWhen Klipspringer had played “The Love Nest” he turned around on the\nbench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.\n\n“I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play. I’m all\nout of prac—”\n\n“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby. “Play!”\n\n“In the morning, In the evening, Ain’t we got fun—”\n\nOutside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along\nthe Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric\ntrains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New\nYork. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was\ngenerating on the air.\n\n“One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer The rich get richer and the\npoor get—children. In the meantime, In between time—”\n\nAs I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of\nbewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt\nhad occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost\nfive years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when\nDaisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but\nbecause of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond\nher, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative\npassion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright\nfeather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can\nchallenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.\n\nAs I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took\nhold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned\ntoward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most,\nwith its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be\nover-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.\n\nThey had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;\nGatsby didn’t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they\nlooked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went\nout of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them\nthere together.\n\n\n                         VI\n\nAbout this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one\nmorning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say.\n\n“Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby politely.\n\n“Why—any statement to give out.”\n\nIt transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard\nGatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he either\nwouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand. This was his day off and\nwith laudable initiative he had hurried out “to see.”\n\nIt was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was right.\nGatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his\nhospitality and so become authorities upon his past, had increased all\nsummer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary legends\nsuch as the “underground pipeline to Canada” attached themselves to\nhim, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house\nat all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly\nup and down the Long Island shore. Just why these inventions were a\nsource of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to\nsay.\n\nJames Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had\nchanged it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that\nwitnessed the beginning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht\ndrop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was\nJames Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a\ntorn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay\nGatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and\ninformed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an\nhour.\n\nI suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then. His\nparents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—his imagination\nhad never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was\nthat Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic\nconception of himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means\nanything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s business,\nthe service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented\njust the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be\nlikely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.\n\nFor over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of\nLake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other\ncapacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body\nlived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing\ndays. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became\ncontemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of\nthe others because they were hysterical about things which in his\noverwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.\n\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque\nand fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of\nineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock\nticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled\nclothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his\nfancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an\noblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for\nhis imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of\nreality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on\na fairy’s wing.\n\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before,\nto the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf’s in southern Minnesota. He\nstayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the\ndrums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s\nwork with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to\nLake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the\nday that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.\n\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,\nof the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The\ntransactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire\nfound him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,\nsuspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him\nfrom his money. The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye,\nthe newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and\nsent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid\njournalism in 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable\nshores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny in\nLittle Girl Bay.\n\nTo young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck,\nthat yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I\nsuppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people liked\nhim when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of\nthem elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and\nextravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and\nbought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a\nyachting cap. And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the\nBarbary Coast, Gatsby left too.\n\nHe was employed in a vague personal capacity—while he remained with\nCody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even\njailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk\nmight soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by\nreposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five\nyears, during which the boat went three times around the Continent.\nIt might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye\ncame on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody\ninhospitably died.\n\nI remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom, a grey, florid\nman with a hard, empty face—the pioneer debauchee, who during one\nphase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage\nviolence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to\nCody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay\nparties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he\nformed the habit of letting liquor alone.\n\nAnd it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five\nthousand dollars. He didn’t get it. He never understood the legal\ndevice that was used against him, but what remained of the millions\nwent intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate\neducation; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the\nsubstantiality of a man.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHe told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here with\nthe idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents,\nwhich weren’t even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time\nof confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and\nnothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while\nGatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of\nmisconceptions away.\n\nIt was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For several\nweeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in\nNew York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself\nwith her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday\nafternoon. I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom\nBuchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really\nsurprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.\n\nThey were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and\na pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.\n\n“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch. “I’m\ndelighted that you dropped in.”\n\nAs though they cared!\n\n“Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around the\nroom quickly, ringing bells. “I’ll have something to drink for you in\njust a minute.”\n\nHe was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he\nwould be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in\na vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted\nnothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all,\nthanks … I’m sorry—\n\n“Did you have a nice ride?”\n\n“Very good roads around here.”\n\n“I suppose the automobiles—”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had\naccepted the introduction as a stranger.\n\n“I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.”\n\n“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering.\n“So we did. I remember very well.”\n\n“About two weeks ago.”\n\n“That’s right. You were with Nick here.”\n\n“I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.\n\n“That so?”\n\nTom turned to me.\n\n“You live near here, Nick?”\n\n“Next door.”\n\n“That so?”\n\nMr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back\nhaughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until\nunexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.\n\n“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested.\n“What do you say?”\n\n“Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”\n\n“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well—think ought\nto be starting home.”\n\n“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself\nnow, and he wanted to see more of Tom. “Why don’t you—why don’t you\nstay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped\nin from New York.”\n\n“You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both of\nyou.”\n\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n\n“Come along,” he said—but to her only.\n\n“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”\n\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn’t see\nthat Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.\n\n“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.\n\n“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.\n\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\n\n“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.\n\n“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. “I used to ride in the army, but\nI’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse\nme for just a minute.”\n\nThe rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady\nbegan an impassioned conversation aside.\n\n“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she\ndoesn’t want him?”\n\n“She says she does want him.”\n\n“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He\nfrowned. “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be\nold-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to\nsuit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”\n\nSuddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted\ntheir horses.\n\n“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late. We’ve got to go.”  And\nthen to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”\n\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they\ntrotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage\njust as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the\nfront door.\n\nTom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on\nthe following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s\nparty. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of\noppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties\nthat summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of\npeople, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured,\nmany-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a\npervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had\nmerely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete\nin itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to\nnothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was\nlooking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening\nto look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your\nown powers of adjustment.\n\nThey arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling\nhundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.\n\n“These things excite me so,” she whispered. “If you want to kiss me\nany time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad\nto arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.\nI’m giving out green—”\n\n“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.\n\n“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvellous—”\n\n“You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.”\n\nTom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n\n“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking\nI don’t know a soul here.”\n\n“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely\nhuman orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. Tom\nand Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies\nthe recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.\n\n“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.\n\n“The man bending over her is her director.”\n\nHe took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n\n“Mrs. Buchanan … and Mr. Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation he\nadded: “the polo player.”\n\n“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”\n\nBut evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “the\npolo player” for the rest of the evening.\n\n“I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked that\nman—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”\n\nGatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.\n\n“Well, I liked him anyhow.”\n\n“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly,\n“I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”\n\nDaisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful,\nconservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before. Then they\nsauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour,\nwhile at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. “In case\nthere’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”\n\nTom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper\ntogether. “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” he\nsaid. “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”\n\n“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any\naddresses here’s my little gold pencil.” … She looked around after a\nmoment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that\nexcept for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t\nhaving a good time.\n\nWe were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—Gatsby had\nbeen called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two\nweeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air\nnow.\n\n“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”\n\nThe girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my\nshoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.\n\n“Wha’?”\n\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf\nwith her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:\n\n“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cocktails she\nalways starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it\nalone.”\n\n“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.\n\n“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody\nthat needs your help, Doc.’ ”\n\n“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without\ngratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in\nthe pool.”\n\n“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss\nBaedeker. “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”\n\n“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.\n\n“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your hand\nshakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”\n\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with\nDaisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were\nstill under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except\nfor a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he\nhad been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this\nproximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate\ndegree and kiss at her cheek.\n\n“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.”\n\nBut the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture\nbut an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented\n“place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing\nvillage—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old\neuphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants\nalong a shortcut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in\nthe very simplicity she failed to understand.\n\nI sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car.\nIt was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet\nof light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow\nmoved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,\nan indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an\ninvisible glass.\n\n“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big\nbootlegger?”\n\n“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.\n\n“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are\njust big bootleggers, you know.”\n\n“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.\n\nHe was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under\nhis feet.\n\n“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie\ntogether.”\n\nA breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar.\n\n“At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she said\nwith an effort.\n\n“You didn’t look so interested.”\n\n“Well, I was.”\n\nTom laughed and turned to me.\n\n“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under\na cold shower?”\n\nDaisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,\nbringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and\nwould never have again. When the melody rose her voice broke up\nsweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change\ntipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.\n\n“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said\nsuddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way\nin and he’s too polite to object.”\n\n“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom. “And I\nthink I’ll make a point of finding out.”\n\n“I can tell you right now,” she answered. “He owned some drugstores, a\nlot of drugstores. He built them up himself.”\n\nThe dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n\n“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.\n\nHer glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where\n“Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year,\nwas drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of\nGatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from\nher world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling\nher back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours?\nPerhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare\nand to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with\none fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would\nblot out those five years of unwavering devotion.\n\nI stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free,\nand I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had\nrun up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights\nwere extinguished in the guestrooms overhead. When he came down the\nsteps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face,\nand his eyes were bright and tired.\n\n“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.\n\n“Of course she did.”\n\n“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”\n\nHe was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\n\n“I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s hard to make her\nunderstand.”\n\n“You mean about the dance?”\n\n“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of\nhis fingers. “Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”\n\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and\nsay: “I never loved you.” After she had obliterated four years with\nthat sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be\ntaken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back\nto Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five\nyears ago.\n\n“And she doesn’t understand,” he said. “She used to be able to\nunderstand. We’d sit for hours—”\n\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit\nrinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.\n\n“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured. “You can’t repeat the\npast.”\n\n“Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you\ncan!”\n\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the\nshadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.\n\n“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said,\nnodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”\n\nHe talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to\nrecover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into\nloving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then,\nbut if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it\nall slowly, he could find out what that thing was …\n\n… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the\nstreet when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where\nthere were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They\nstopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night\nwith that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes\nof the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the\ndarkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the\ncorner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really\nformed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could\nclimb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the\npap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\n\nHis heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He\nknew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable\nvisions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like\nthe mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the\ntuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At\nhis lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the\nincarnation was complete.\n\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was\nreminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words,\nthat I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase\ntried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s,\nas though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled\nair. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was\nuncommunicable forever.\n\n\n                        VII\n\nIt was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights\nin his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as\nit had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually did I\nbecome aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his\ndrive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering\nif he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a\nvillainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.\n\n“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”\n\n“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir” in a dilatory, grudging way.\n\n“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr.\nCarraway came over.”\n\n“Who?” he demanded rudely.\n\n“Carraway.”\n\n“Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.”\n\nAbruptly he slammed the door.\n\nMy Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his\nhouse a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never\nwent into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered\nmoderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that\nthe kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the\nvillage was that the new people weren’t servants at all.\n\nNext day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n\n“Going away?” I inquired.\n\n“No, old sport.”\n\n“I hear you fired all your servants.”\n\n“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite\noften—in the afternoons.”\n\nSo the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the\ndisapproval in her eyes.\n\n“They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They’re all\nbrothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”\n\n“I see.”\n\nHe was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I come to lunch at her\nhouse tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy\nherself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was\ncoming. Something was up. And yet I couldn’t believe that they would\nchoose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing\nscene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.\n\nThe next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of\nthe summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only\nthe hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering\nhush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of\ncombustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into\nher white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her\nfingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her\npocketbook slapped to the floor.\n\n“Oh, my!” she gasped.\n\nI picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it\nat arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that\nI had no designs upon it—but everyone near by, including the woman,\nsuspected me just the same.\n\n“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces. “Some weather! … Hot! …\nHot! … Hot! … Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it … ?”\n\nMy commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.\nThat anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,\nwhose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart!\n\n… Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying\nthe sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at\nthe door.\n\n“The master’s body?” roared the butler into the mouthpiece. “I’m\nsorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it—it’s far too hot to touch this\nnoon!”\n\nWhat he really said was: “Yes … Yes … I’ll see.”\n\nHe set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to\ntake our stiff straw hats.\n\n“Madame expects you in the salon!” he cried, needlessly indicating the\ndirection. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the\ncommon store of life.\n\nThe room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and\nJordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down\ntheir own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\n\n“We can’t move,” they said together.\n\nJordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment\nin mine.\n\n“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.\n\nSimultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall\ntelephone.\n\nGatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with\nfascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting\nlaugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.\n\n“The rumour is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the\ntelephone.”\n\nWe were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very\nwell, then, I won’t sell you the car at all … I’m under no obligations\nto you at all … and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I\nwon’t stand that at all!”\n\n“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.\n\n“No, he’s not,” I assured her. “It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen to\nknow about it.”\n\nTom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his\nthick body, and hurried into the room.\n\n“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed\ndislike. “I’m glad to see you, sir … Nick …”\n\n“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.\n\nAs he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and\npulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.\n\n“You know I love you,” she murmured.\n\n“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.\n\nDaisy looked around doubtfully.\n\n“You kiss Nick too.”\n\n“What a low, vulgar girl!”\n\n“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace.\nThen she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just\nas a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\n\n“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms. “Come to your\nown mother that loves you.”\n\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and\nrooted shyly into her mother’s dress.\n\n“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy\nhair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.”\n\nGatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.\nAfterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think he\nhad ever really believed in its existence before.\n\n“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to\nDaisy.\n\n“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.” Her face bent\ninto the single wrinkle of the small white neck. “You dream, you. You\nabsolute little dream.”\n\n“Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress\ntoo.”\n\n“How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so that\nshe faced Gatsby. “Do you think they’re pretty?”\n\n“Where’s Daddy?”\n\n“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy. “She looks like\nme. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”\n\nDaisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held\nout her hand.\n\n“Come, Pammy.”\n\n“Goodbye, sweetheart!”\n\nWith a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to\nher nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,\npreceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.\n\nGatsby took up his drink.\n\n“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.\n\nWe drank in long, greedy swallows.\n\n“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom\ngenially. “It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into\nthe sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting\ncolder every year.\n\n“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look\nat the place.”\n\nI went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in\nthe heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.\nGatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed\nacross the bay.\n\n“I’m right across from you.”\n\n“So you are.”\n\nOur eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy\nrefuse of the dog-days alongshore. Slowly the white wings of the boat\nmoved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped\nocean and the abounding blessed isles.\n\n“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out there\nwith him for about an hour.”\n\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and\ndrank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.\n\n“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the\nday after that, and the next thirty years?”\n\n“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it\ngets crisp in the fall.”\n\n“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and\neverything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”\n\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding\nits senselessness into forms.\n\n“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to\nGatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a\ngarage.”\n\n“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes\nfloated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”\n\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in\nspace. With an effort she glanced down at the table.\n\n“You always look so cool,” she repeated.\n\nShe had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was\nastounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and\nthen back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew\na long time ago.\n\n“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently.\n“You know the advertisement of the man—”\n\n“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to\ntown. Come on—we’re all going to town.”\n\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one\nmoved.\n\n“Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow?\nIf we’re going to town, let’s start.”\n\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips\nthe last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out\non to the blazing gravel drive.\n\n“Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going\nto let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”\n\n“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”\n\n“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.”\n\nHe didn’t answer.\n\n“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”\n\nThey went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there\nshuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon\nhovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed\nhis mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n\n“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.\n\n“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\nA pause.\n\n“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely.\n“Women get these notions in their heads—”\n\n“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.\n\n“I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom. He went inside.\n\nGatsby turned to me rigidly:\n\n“I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”\n\n“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of—” I\nhesitated.\n\n“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.\n\nThat was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that\nwas the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of\nit, the cymbals’ song of it … High in a white palace the king’s\ndaughter, the golden girl …\n\nTom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed\nby Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and\ncarrying light capes over their arms.\n\n“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green\nleather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”\n\n“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.”\n\nThe suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.\n\n“I don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected.\n\n“Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. “And\nif it runs out I can stop at a drugstore. You can buy anything at a\ndrugstore nowadays.”\n\nA pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom\nfrowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar\nand vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in\nwords, passed over Gatsby’s face.\n\n“Come on, Daisy” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s\ncar. “I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”\n\nHe opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.\n\n“You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupé.”\n\nShe walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan\nand Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed the\nunfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive\nheat, leaving them out of sight behind.\n\n“Did you see that?” demanded Tom.\n\n“See what?”\n\nHe looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known\nall along.\n\n“You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?” he suggested. “Perhaps I am,\nbut I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to\ndo. Maybe you don’t believe that, but science—”\n\nHe paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back\nfrom the edge of theoretical abyss.\n\n“I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued. “I\ncould have gone deeper if I’d known—”\n\n“Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.\n\n“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. “A medium?”\n\n“About Gatsby.”\n\n“About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a small\ninvestigation of his past.”\n\n“And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully.\n\n“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. “Like hell he is! He wears a pink\nsuit.”\n\n“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”\n\n“Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something like\nthat.”\n\n“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?”\ndemanded Jordan crossly.\n\n“Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows\nwhere!”\n\nWe were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we\ndrove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded\neyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution\nabout gasoline.\n\n“We’ve got enough to get us to town,” said Tom.\n\n“But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jordan. “I don’t want to\nget stalled in this baking heat.”\n\nTom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty\nstop under Wilson’s sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from\nthe interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\n\n“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What do you think we\nstopped for—to admire the view?”\n\n“I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving. “Been sick all day.”\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\n“I’m all run down.”\n\n“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough on\nthe phone.”\n\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,\nbreathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his\nface was green.\n\n“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said. “But I need money\npretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your\nold car.”\n\n“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”\n\n“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\n\n“Like to buy it?”\n\n“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No, but I could make some money\non the other.”\n\n“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”\n\n“I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go\nWest.”\n\n“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.\n\n“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a moment\nagainst the pump, shading his eyes. “And now she’s going whether she\nwants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”\n\nThe coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a\nwaving hand.\n\n“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.\n\n“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked\nWilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering\nyou about the car.”\n\n“What do I owe you?”\n\n“Dollar twenty.”\n\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a\nbad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t\nalighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life\napart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically\nsick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel\ndiscovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there\nwas no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as\nthe difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that\nhe looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor\ngirl with child.\n\n“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom. “I’ll send it over tomorrow\nafternoon.”\n\nThat locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare\nof afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of\nsomething behind. Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J.\nEckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that\nother eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than\ntwenty feet away.\n\nIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved\naside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So\nengrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and\none emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a\nslowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it\nwas an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle\nWilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized\nthat her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on\nJordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we\ndrove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his\nmistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping\nprecipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the\naccelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving\nWilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an\nhour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in\nsight of the easygoing blue coupé.\n\n“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested\nJordan. “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away.\nThere’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of\nfunny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”\n\nThe word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but\nbefore he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy\nsignalled us to draw up alongside.\n\n“Where are we going?” she cried.\n\n“How about the movies?”\n\n“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We’ll ride around and meet you\nafter.” With an effort her wit rose faintly. “We’ll meet you on some\ncorner. I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”\n\n“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave\nout a cursing whistle behind us. “You follow me to the south side of\nCentral Park, in front of the Plaza.”\n\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if\nthe traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I\nthink he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his\nlife forever.\n\nBut they didn’t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging\nthe parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\n\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into\nthat room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in\nthe course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around\nmy legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.\nThe notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five\nbathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as\n“a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it\nwas a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and\nthought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny …\n\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four\no’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery\nfrom the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,\nfixing her hair.\n\n“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone\nlaughed.\n\n“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.\n\n“There aren’t any more.”\n\n“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—”\n\n“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently.\n“You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”\n\nHe unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the\ntable.\n\n“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby. “You’re the one\nthat wanted to come to town.”\n\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its\nnail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse\nme”—but this time no one laughed.\n\n“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.\n\n“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in\nan interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\n\n“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.\n\n“What is?”\n\n“All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”\n\n“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if\nyou’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute.\nCall up and order some ice for the mint julep.”\n\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound\nand we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s\nWedding March from the ballroom below.\n\n“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.\n\n“Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered.\n“Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”\n\n“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.\n\n“A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a\nfact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”\n\n“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived\njust two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy\ntold him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.”  After\na moment she added. “There wasn’t any connection.”\n\n“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.\n\n“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he\nleft. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”\n\nThe music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer\nfloated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of\n“Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.\n\n“We’re getting old,” said Daisy. “If we were young we’d rise and\ndance.”\n\n“Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her. “Where’d you know him, Tom?”\n\n“Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort. “I didn’t know him. He was a\nfriend of Daisy’s.”\n\n“He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down in\nthe private car.”\n\n“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa\nBird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room\nfor him.”\n\nJordan smiled.\n\n“He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of\nyour class at Yale.”\n\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\n\n“Biloxi?”\n\n“First place, we didn’t have any president—”\n\nGatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\n\n“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”\n\n“Not exactly.”\n\n“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”\n\n“Yes—I went there.”\n\nA pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting:\n\n“You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”\n\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice\nbut the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing\nof the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n\n“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.\n\n“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”\n\n“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why I\ncan’t really call myself an Oxford man.”\n\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all\nlooking at Gatsby.\n\n“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the\narmistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in\nEngland or France.”\n\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those\nrenewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.\n\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n\n“Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep.\nThen you won’t seem so stupid to yourself … Look at the mint!”\n\n“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more\nquestion.”\n\n“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.\n\n“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”\n\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\n\n“He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately from one to the\nother. “You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”\n\n“Self-control!” repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latest\nthing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your\nwife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out … Nowadays people\nbegin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next\nthey’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between\nblack and white.”\n\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone\non the last barrier of civilization.\n\n“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.\n\n“I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties. I suppose\nyou’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any\nfriends—in the modern world.”\n\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he\nopened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so\ncomplete.\n\n“I’ve got something to tell you, old sport—” began Gatsby. But Daisy\nguessed at his intention.\n\n“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all go\nhome. Why don’t we all go home?”\n\n“That’s a good idea,” I got up. “Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”\n\n“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”\n\n“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you.\nShe loves me.”\n\n“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.\n\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n\n“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you\nbecause I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a\nterrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”\n\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted\nwith competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had\nanything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously\nof their emotions.\n\n“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal\nnote. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”\n\n“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five\nyears—and you didn’t know.”\n\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\n\n“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”\n\n“Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved\neach other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to\nlaugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think that\nyou didn’t know.”\n\n“Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a\nclergyman and leaned back in his chair.\n\n“You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened five\nyears ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I\nsee how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries\nto the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisy\nloved me when she married me and she loves me now.”\n\n“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n\n“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish\nideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded\nsagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off\non a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in\nmy heart I love her all the time.”\n\n“You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,\ndropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do\nyou know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you\nto the story of that little spree.”\n\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n\n“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter\nany more. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’s\nall wiped out forever.”\n\nShe looked at him blindly. “Why—how could I love him—possibly?”\n\n“You never loved him.”\n\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,\nas though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she\nhad never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done\nnow. It was too late.\n\n“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.\n\n“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.\n\n“No.”\n\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were\ndrifting up on hot waves of air.\n\n“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your\nshoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone … “Daisy?”\n\n“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.\nShe looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she tried\nto light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette\nand the burning match on the carpet.\n\n“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now—isn’t\nthat enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob\nhelplessly. “I did love him once—but I loved you too.”\n\nGatsby’s eyes opened and closed.\n\n“You loved me too?” he repeated.\n\n“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were\nalive. Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know,\nthings that neither of us can ever forget.”\n\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n\n“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited\nnow—”\n\n“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful\nvoice. “It wouldn’t be true.”\n\n“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.\n\nShe turned to her husband.\n\n“As if it mattered to you,” she said.\n\n“Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now\non.”\n\n“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’re\nnot going to take care of her any more.”\n\n“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to\ncontrol himself now. “Why’s that?”\n\n“Daisy’s leaving you.”\n\n“Nonsense.”\n\n“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.\n\n“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.\n“Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he\nput on her finger.”\n\n“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”\n\n“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that\nhangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve\nmade a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it\nfurther tomorrow.”\n\n“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.\n\n“I found out what your ‘drugstores’ were.” He turned to us and spoke\nrapidly. “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street\ndrugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the\ncounter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a\nbootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”\n\n“What about it?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess your friend Walter\nChase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”\n\n“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for\na month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the\nsubject of you.”\n\n“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old\nsport.”\n\n“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby said\nnothing. “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but\nWolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”\n\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.\n\n“That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly,\n“but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me\nabout.”\n\nI glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her\nhusband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but\nabsorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to\nGatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said\nin all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had\n“killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described in\njust that fantastic way.\n\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying\neverything, defending his name against accusations that had not been\nmade. But with every word she was drawing further and further into\nherself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the\nafternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible,\nstruggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across\nthe room.\n\nThe voice begged again to go.\n\n“Please, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.”\n\nHer frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage\nshe had had, were definitely gone.\n\n“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom. “In Mr. Gatsby’s car.”\n\nShe looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous\nscorn.\n\n“Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous\nlittle flirtation is over.”\n\nThey were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental,\nisolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.\n\nAfter a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of\nwhisky in the towel.\n\n“Want any of this stuff? Jordan? … Nick?”\n\nI didn’t answer.\n\n“Nick?” He asked again.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Want any?”\n\n“No … I just remembered that today’s my birthday.”\n\nI was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a\nnew decade.\n\nIt was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started\nfor Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but\nhis voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on\nthe sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy\nhas its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments\nfade with the city lights behind. Thirty—the promise of a decade of\nloneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning\nbriefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside\nme, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten\ndreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face\nfell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of\nthirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\n\nSo we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the\nash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept\nthrough the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the\ngarage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale\nas his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go\nto bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if\nhe did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent\nracket broke out overhead.\n\n“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly.\n“She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re\ngoing to move away.”\n\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and\nWilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.\nGenerally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he\nsat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars\nthat passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably\nlaughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife’s man and not\nhis own.\n\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson\nwouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious\nglances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain\ntimes on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some\nworkmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis\ntook the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he\ndidn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside\nagain, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation\nbecause he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in\nthe garage.\n\n“Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw me down and beat me, you dirty\nlittle coward!”\n\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and\nshouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.\n\nThe “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out\nof the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then\ndisappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of\nits colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The\nother car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards\nbeyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life\nviolently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark\nblood with the dust.\n\nMichaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open\nher shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left\nbreast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen\nfor the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at\nthe corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the\ntremendous vitality she had stored so long.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still\nsome distance away.\n\n“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at\nlast.”\n\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as\nwe came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage\ndoor made him automatically put on the brakes.\n\n“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”\n\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly\nfrom the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked\ntoward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered\nover and over in a gasping moan.\n\n“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.\n\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the\ngarage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal\nbasket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a\nviolent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way\nthrough.\n\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it\nwas a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals\nderanged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\n\nMyrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another\nblanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on\na worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending\nover it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking\ndown names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I\ncouldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed\nclamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the\nraised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\nthe doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low\nvoice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his\nshoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly\nfrom the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk\nback to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high,\nhorrible call:\n\n“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!”\n\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around\nthe garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to\nthe policeman.\n\n“M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”\n\n“No, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—”\n\n“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.\n\n“r—” said the policeman, “o—”\n\n“g—”\n\n“g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.\n“What you want, fella?”\n\n“What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”\n\n“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”\n\n“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.\n\n“She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”\n\n“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”\n\n“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.\n\n“One goin’ each way. Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but\nstopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the one\ncomin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles\nan hour.”\n\n“What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer.\n\n“Hasn’t got any name.”\n\nA pale well-dressed negro stepped near.\n\n“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”\n\n“See the accident?” asked the policeman.\n\n“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going\nfifty, sixty.”\n\n“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his\nname.”\n\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in\nthe office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his\ngrasping cries:\n\n“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind\nof car it was!”\n\nWatching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten\nunder his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in\nfront of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n\n“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing\ngruffness.\n\nWilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then\nwould have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n\n“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little. “I just got here a minute\nago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking\nabout. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you\nhear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”\n\nOnly the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the\npoliceman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent\neyes.\n\n“What’s all that?” he demanded.\n\n“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on\nWilson’s body. “He says he knows the car that did it … It was a yellow\ncar.”\n\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n\n“And what colour’s your car?”\n\n“It’s a blue car, a coupé.”\n\n“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.\n\nSomeone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and\nthe policeman turned away.\n\n“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”\n\nPicking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set\nhim down in a chair, and came back.\n\n“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped\nauthoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced\nat each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the\ndoor on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the\ntable. As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”\n\nSelf-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we\npushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,\ncase in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\n\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down\nhard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I\nheard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down\nhis face.\n\n“The God damned coward!” he whimpered. “He didn’t even stop his car.”\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark\nrustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the\nsecond floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n\n“Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and\nfrowned slightly.\n\n“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can\ndo tonight.”\n\nA change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision.\nAs we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of\nthe situation in a few brisk phrases.\n\n“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting\nyou and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some\nsupper—if you want any.” He opened the door. “Come in.”\n\n“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait\noutside.”\n\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n\n“Won’t you come in, Nick?”\n\n“No, thanks.”\n\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan\nlingered for a moment more.\n\n“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.\n\nI’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day,\nand suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of\nthis in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the\nporch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head\nin my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s\nvoice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from\nthe house, intending to wait by the gate.\n\nI hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped\nfrom between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird\nby that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity\nof his pink suit under the moon.\n\n“What are you doing?” I inquired.\n\n“Just standing here, old sport.”\n\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was\ngoing to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to\nsee sinister faces, the faces of “Wolfshiem’s people,” behind him in\nthe dark shrubbery.\n\n“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n“Was she killed?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock\nshould all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”\n\nHe spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n\n“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in\nmy garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be\nsure.”\n\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to\ntell him he was wrong.\n\n“Who was the woman?” he inquired.\n\n“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did\nit happen?”\n\n“Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly I\nguessed at the truth.\n\n“Was Daisy driving?”\n\n“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see,\nwhen we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would\nsteady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were\npassing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but\nit seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were\nsomebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward\nthe other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second\nmy hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her\ninstantly.”\n\n“It ripped her open—”\n\n“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I\ntried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency\nbrake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n\n“She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going to\nwait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness\nthis afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries\nany brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”\n\n“He won’t touch her,” I said. “He’s not thinking about her.”\n\n“I don’t trust him, old sport.”\n\n“How long are you going to wait?”\n\n“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”\n\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy\nhad been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might\nthink anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright\nwindows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground\nfloor.\n\n“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a\ncommotion.”\n\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel\nsoftly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains\nwere open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where\nwe had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small\nrectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind\nwas drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.\n\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table,\nwith a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of\nale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his\nearnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a\nwhile she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\n\nThey weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the\nale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air\nof natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said\nthat they were conspiring together.\n\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the\ndark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in\nthe drive.\n\n“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.\n\n“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated. “You’d better come home and get\nsome sleep.”\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”\n\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his\nscrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of\nthe vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the\nmoonlight—watching over nothing.\n\n\n                        VIII\n\nI couldn’t sleep all night; a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the\nSound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage,\nfrightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive,\nand immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I\nhad something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning\nwould be too late.\n\nCrossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was\nleaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.\n\n“Nothing happened,” he said wanly. “I waited, and about four o’clock\nshe came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned\nout the light.”\n\nHis house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when\nwe hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside\ncurtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of\ndark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of\nsplash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable\namount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they\nhadn’t been aired for many days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar\ntable, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open the French\nwindows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.\n\n“You ought to go away,” I said. “It’s pretty certain they’ll trace\nyour car.”\n\n“Go away now, old sport?”\n\n“Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.”\n\nHe wouldn’t consider it. He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until he\nknew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and\nI couldn’t bear to shake him free.\n\nIt was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with\nDan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass\nagainst Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played\nout. I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without\nreserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.\n\nShe was the first “nice” girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed\ncapacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with\nindiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly\ndesirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from\nCamp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him—he had never been in such a\nbeautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless\nintensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her\nas his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,\na hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other\nbedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its\ncorridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already\nin lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s\nshining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely\nwithered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved\nDaisy—it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all\nabout the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still\nvibrant emotions.\n\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal\naccident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was\nat present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the\ninvisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he\nmade the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and\nunscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took\nher because he had no real right to touch her hand.\n\nHe might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under\nfalse pretences. I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom\nmillions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he\nlet her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as\nherself—that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of\nfact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing\nbehind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government\nto be blown anywhere about the world.\n\nBut he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had\nimagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but\nnow he found that he had committed himself to the following of a\ngrail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize\njust how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. She vanished into her\nrich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt\nmarried to her, that was all.\n\nWhen they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless,\nwho was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought\nluxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as\nshe turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She\nhad caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming\nthan ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and\nmystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many\nclothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the\nhot struggles of the poor.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,\nold sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she\ndidn’t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot\nbecause I knew different things from her … Well, there I was, way off\nmy ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden\nI didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have\na better time telling her what I was going to do?”\n\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his\narms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the\nroom and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his\narm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon\nhad made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory\nfor the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer\nin their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with\nanother, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder\nor when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were\nasleep.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHe did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he\nwent to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his\nmajority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the\narmistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or\nmisunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—there\nwas a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She didn’t see\nwhy he couldn’t come. She was feeling the pressure of the world\noutside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her\nand be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\n\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids\nand pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of\nthe year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new\ntunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the\n“Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver\nslippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were\nalways rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever,\nwhile fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the\nsad horns around the floor.\n\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the\nseason; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with\nhalf a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and\nchiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor\nbeside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a\ndecision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision\nmust be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable\npracticality—that was close at hand.\n\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom\nBuchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his\nposition, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain\nstruggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was\nstill at Oxford.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of\nthe windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning,\ngold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew\nand ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a\nslow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool,\nlovely day.\n\n“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window\nand looked at me challengingly. “You must remember, old sport, she was\nvery excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that\nfrightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap\nsharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”\n\nHe sat down gloomily.\n\n“Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were\nfirst married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”\n\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark.\n\n“In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”\n\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his\nconception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?\n\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their\nwedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to\nLouisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week,\nwalking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through\nthe November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which\nthey had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy’s house had always\nseemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea\nof the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded\nwith a melancholy beauty.\n\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found\nher—that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach—he was penniless\nnow—was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a\nfolding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar\nbuildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow\ntrolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have\nseen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.\n\nThe track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it\nsank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing\ncity where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand\ndesperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of\nthe spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too\nfast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part\nof it, the freshest and the best, forever.\n\nIt was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the\nporch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there\nwas an autumn flavour in the air. The gardener, the last one of\nGatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.\n\n“I’m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves’ll start\nfalling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.”\n\n“Don’t do it today,” Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.\n“You know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer?”\n\nI looked at my watch and stood up.\n\n“Twelve minutes to my train.”\n\nI didn’t want to go to the city. I wasn’t worth a decent stroke of\nwork, but it was more than that—I didn’t want to leave Gatsby. I\nmissed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.\n\n“I’ll call you up,” I said finally.\n\n“Do, old sport.”\n\n“I’ll call you about noon.”\n\nWe walked slowly down the steps.\n\n“I suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked at me anxiously, as if he\nhoped I’d corroborate this.\n\n“I suppose so.”\n\n“Well, goodbye.”\n\nWe shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I\nremembered something and turned around.\n\n“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn. “You’re worth the\nwhole damn bunch put together.”\n\nI’ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever\ngave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he\nnodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and\nunderstanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact\nall the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of\ncolour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I\nfirst came to his ancestral home, three months before. The lawn and\ndrive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his\ncorruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his\nincorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.\n\nI thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for\nthat—I and the others.\n\n“Goodbye,” I called. “I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.”\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUp in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an\ninterminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.\nJust before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat\nbreaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called me\nup at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between\nhotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other\nway. Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool,\nas if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the\noffice window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.\n\n“I’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said. “I’m at Hempstead, and I’m going\ndown to Southampton this afternoon.”\n\nProbably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house, but the act\nannoyed me, and her next remark made me rigid.\n\n“You weren’t so nice to me last night.”\n\n“How could it have mattered then?”\n\nSilence for a moment. Then:\n\n“However—I want to see you.”\n\n“I want to see you, too.”\n\n“Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town this\nafternoon?”\n\n“No—I don’t think this afternoon.”\n\n“Very well.”\n\n“It’s impossible this afternoon. Various—”\n\nWe talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren’t talking\nany longer. I don’t know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but I\nknow I didn’t care. I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-table\nthat day if I never talked to her again in this world.\n\nI called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I\ntried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was\nbeing kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my\ntimetable, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I\nleaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen I passed the ash-heaps on the train that morning I had crossed\ndeliberately to the other side of the car. I supposed there’d be a\ncurious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark\nspots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling over and over what\nhad happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he\ncould tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achievement was\nforgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at\nthe garage after we left there the night before.\n\nThey had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have\nbroken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she\nwas stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had\nalready gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of this, she\nimmediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the\naffair. Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in\nthe wake of her sister’s body.\n\nUntil long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front\nof the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on\nthe couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open, and\neveryone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.\nFinally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door. Michaelis\nand several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later\ntwo or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger\nto wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own\nplace and made a pot of coffee. After that, he stayed there alone with\nWilson until dawn.\n\nAbout three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering\nchanged—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He\nannounced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car\nbelonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his\nwife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose\nswollen.\n\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh,\nmy God!” again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt\nto distract him.\n\n“How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit\nstill a minute, and answer my question. How long have you been\nmarried?”\n\n“Twelve years.”\n\n“Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a\nquestion. Did you ever have any children?”\n\nThe hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and\nwhenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it\nsounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before.\nHe didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was\nstained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably\naround the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from\ntime to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.\n\n“Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you\nhaven’t been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church\nand get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”\n\n“Don’t belong to any.”\n\n“You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must\nhave gone to church once. Didn’t you get married in a church? Listen,\nGeorge, listen to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”\n\n“That was a long time ago.”\n\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment\nhe was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came\nback into his faded eyes.\n\n“Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.\n\n“Which drawer?”\n\n“That drawer—that one.”\n\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it\nbut a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided\nsilver. It was apparently new.\n\n“This?” he inquired, holding it up.\n\nWilson stared and nodded.\n\n“I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I\nknew it was something funny.”\n\n“You mean your wife bought it?”\n\n“She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.”\n\nMichaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen\nreasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably\nWilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,\nbecause he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter\nleft several explanations in the air.\n\n“Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.\n\n“Who did?”\n\n“I have a way of finding out.”\n\n“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend. “This has been a strain to\nyou and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sit\nquiet till morning.”\n\n“He murdered her.”\n\n“It was an accident, George.”\n\nWilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened\nslightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”\n\n“I know,” he said definitely. “I’m one of these trusting fellas and I\ndon’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know\nit. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he\nwouldn’t stop.”\n\nMichaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there\nwas any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had\nbeen running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any\nparticular car.\n\n“How could she of been like that?”\n\n“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question.\n“Ah-h-h—”\n\nHe began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his\nhand.\n\n“Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”\n\nThis was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:\nthere was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later\nwhen he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window,\nand realized that dawn wasn’t far off. About five o’clock it was blue\nenough outside to snap off the light.\n\nWilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey\nclouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the\nfaint dawn wind.\n\n“I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence. “I told her she\nmight fool me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her to the\nwindow”—with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and\nleaned with his face pressed against it—“and I said ‘God knows what\nyou’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing. You may fool me, but\nyou can’t fool God!’ ”\n\nStanding behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at\nthe eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and\nenormous, from the dissolving night.\n\n“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.\n\n“That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him. Something made him\nturn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson\nstood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding\ninto the twilight.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a\ncar stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before\nwho had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which\nhe and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, and\nMichaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and\nhurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.\n\nHis movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to\nPort Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that\nhe didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and\nwalking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon. Thus far\nthere was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who\nhad seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared\noddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared\nfrom view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis,\nthat he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time\ngoing from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On\nthe other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and\nperhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to\nknow. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the\nway to Gatsby’s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the\nbutler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the\npool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had\namused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to\npump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be\ntaken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the\nfront right fender needed repair.\n\nGatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he\nstopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he\nneeded help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among\nthe yellowing trees.\n\nNo telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep\nand waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was anyone\nto give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t\nbelieve it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was\ntrue he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a\nhigh price for living too long with a single dream. He must have\nlooked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered\nas he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight\nwas upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without\nbeing real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted\nfortuitously about … like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward\nhim through the amorphous trees.\n\nThe chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the\nshots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything\nmuch about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house\nand my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that\nalarmed anyone. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a\nword said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried\ndown to the pool.\n\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the\nfresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.\nWith little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden\nmattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that\nscarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental\ncourse with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves\nrevolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red\ncircle in the water.\n\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener\nsaw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was\ncomplete.\n\n\n                         IX\n\nAfter two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and\nthe next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and\nnewspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door. A rope stretched\nacross the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but\nlittle boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and\nthere were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the\npool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the\nexpression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and\nthe adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper\nreports next morning.\n\nMost of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial,\neager, and untrue. When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought\nto light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale\nwould shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might\nhave said anything, didn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount\nof character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes\nunder that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never\nseen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband,\nthat her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced\nherself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very\nsuggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a\nman “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its\nsimplest form. And it rested there.\n\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself\non Gatsby’s side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the\ncatastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every\npractical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and\nconfused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or\nspeak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because\nno one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense\npersonal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.\n\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her\ninstinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away\nearly that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\n\n“Left no address?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Say when they’d be back?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?”\n\n“I don’t know. Can’t say.”\n\nI wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where\nhe lay and reassure him: “I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’t\nworry. Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you—”\n\nMeyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone book. The butler gave me\nhis office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the\ntime I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the\nphone.\n\n“Will you ring again?”\n\n“I’ve rung three times.”\n\n“It’s very important.”\n\n“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”\n\nI went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they\nwere chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled\nit. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with\nshocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:\n\n“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me. You’ve got\nto try hard. I can’t go through this alone.”\n\nSomeone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going\nupstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d\nnever told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was\nnothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence,\nstaring down from the wall.\n\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem,\nwhich asked for information and urged him to come out on the next\ntrain. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure\nhe’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a\nwire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem\narrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and\nnewspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began\nto have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby\nand me against them all.\n\nDear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of\nmy life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a\nmad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down\nnow as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get\nmixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little\nlater let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when\nI hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and\nout.\n\n                      Yours truly\n\n                    Meyer Wolfshiem\n\nand then hasty addenda beneath:\n\nLet me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all.\n\nWhen the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was\ncalling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came\nthrough as a man’s voice, very thin and far away.\n\n“This is Slagle speaking …”\n\n“Yes?” The name was unfamiliar.\n\n“Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?”\n\n“There haven’t been any wires.”\n\n“Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly. “They picked him up when\nhe handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New\nYork giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before. What d’you know\nabout that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns—”\n\n“Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly. “Look here—this isn’t Mr.\nGatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an\nexclamation … then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz\narrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was\nleaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.\n\nIt was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed,\nbundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His\neyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and\numbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse\ngrey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on\nthe point of collapse, so I took him into the music-room and made him\nsit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn’t eat, and\nthe glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.\n\n“I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said. “It was all in the\nChicago newspaper. I started right away.”\n\n“I didn’t know how to reach you.”\n\nHis eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.\n\n“It was a madman,” he said. “He must have been mad.”\n\n“Wouldn’t you like some coffee?” I urged him.\n\n“I don’t want anything. I’m all right now, Mr.—”\n\n“Carraway.”\n\n“Well, I’m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?”\n\nI took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him\nthere. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into\nthe hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly\naway.\n\nAfter a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth\najar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and\nunpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the\nquality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the\nfirst time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great\nrooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be\nmixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he\ntook off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been\ndeferred until he came.\n\n“I didn’t know what you’d want, Mr. Gatsby—”\n\n“Gatz is my name.”\n\n“—Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.”\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n“Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in\nthe East. Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?”\n\n“We were close friends.”\n\n“He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man,\nbut he had a lot of brain power here.”\n\nHe touched his head impressively, and I nodded.\n\n“If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A man like James J.\nHill. He’d of helped build up the country.”\n\n“That’s true,” I said, uncomfortably.\n\nHe fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the\nbed, and lay down stiffly—was instantly asleep.\n\nThat night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded to\nknow who I was before he would give his name.\n\n“This is Mr. Carraway,” I said.\n\n“Oh!” He sounded relieved. “This is Klipspringer.”\n\nI was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend at\nGatsby’s grave. I didn’t want it to be in the papers and draw a\nsightseeing crowd, so I’d been calling up a few people myself. They\nwere hard to find.\n\n“The funeral’s tomorrow,” I said. “Three o’clock, here at the house.\nI wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested.”\n\n“Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily. “Of course I’m not likely to see\nanybody, but if I do.”\n\nHis tone made me suspicious.\n\n“Of course you’ll be there yourself.”\n\n“Well, I’ll certainly try. What I called up about is—”\n\n“Wait a minute,” I interrupted. “How about saying you’ll come?”\n\n“Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with\nsome people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with\nthem tomorrow. In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or something. Of\ncourse I’ll do my best to get away.”\n\nI ejaculated an unrestrained “Huh!” and he must have heard me, for he\nwent on nervously:\n\n“What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if\nit’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see,\nthey’re tennis shoes, and I’m sort of helpless without them. My\naddress is care of B. F.—”\n\nI didn’t hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver.\n\nAfter that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one gentleman to whom I\ntelephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was\nmy fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at\nGatsby on the courage of Gatsby’s liquor, and I should have known\nbetter than to call him.\n\nThe morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer\nWolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way. The door that I\npushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked “The\nSwastika Holding Company,” and at first there didn’t seem to be anyone\ninside. But when I’d shouted “hello” several times in vain, an\nargument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess\nappeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile\neyes.\n\n“Nobody’s in,” she said. “Mr. Wolfshiem’s gone to Chicago.”\n\nThe first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to\nwhistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.\n\n“Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.”\n\n“I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?”\n\nAt this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella!”\nfrom the other side of the door.\n\n“Leave your name on the desk,” she said quickly. “I’ll give it to him\nwhen he gets back.”\n\n“But I know he’s there.”\n\nShe took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up\nand down her hips.\n\n“You young men think you can force your way in here any time,” she\nscolded. “We’re getting sickantired of it. When I say he’s in Chicago,\nhe’s in Chicago.”\n\nI mentioned Gatsby.\n\n“Oh-h!” She looked at me over again. “Will you just—What was your\nname?”\n\nShe vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the\ndoorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking\nin a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered\nme a cigar.\n\n“My memory goes back to when first I met him,” he said. “A young major\njust out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war.\nHe was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he\ncouldn’t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he\ncame into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a\njob. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘Come on have some\nlunch with me,’ I said. He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food\nin half an hour.”\n\n“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.\n\n“Start him! I made him.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\n“I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right\naway he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told\nme he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join\nthe American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did\nsome work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like\nthat in everything”—he held up two bulbous fingers—“always together.”\n\nI wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series\ntransaction in 1919.\n\n“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. “You were his closest friend,\nso I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.”\n\n“I’d like to come.”\n\n“Well, come then.”\n\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head\nhis eyes filled with tears.\n\n“I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.\n\n“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.”\n\n“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any\nway. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different—if a friend\nof mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may\nthink that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end.”\n\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,\nso I stood up.\n\n“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.\n\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “gonnegtion,” but he\nonly nodded and shook my hand.\n\n“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and\nnot after he is dead,” he suggested. “After that my own rule is to let\neverything alone.”\n\nWhen I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West\nEgg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found\nMr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his\nson and in his son’s possessions was continually increasing and now he\nhad something to show me.\n\n“Jimmy sent me this picture.” He took out his wallet with trembling\nfingers. “Look there.”\n\nIt was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty\nwith many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. “Look\nthere!” and then sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so\noften that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself.\n\n“Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It shows up\nwell.”\n\n“Very well. Had you seen him lately?”\n\n“He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in\nnow. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see\nnow there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of\nhim. And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.”\n\nHe seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another\nminute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and\npulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong\nCassidy.\n\n“Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows\nyou.”\n\nHe opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On\nthe last flyleaf was printed the word schedule, and the date September\n12, 1906. And underneath:\n\nRise from bed                                  6:00      a.m.\nDumbell exercise and wall-scaling              6:15-6:30 ”\nStudy electricity, etc.                        7:15-8:15 ”\nWork                                           8:30-4:30 p.m.\nBaseball and sports                            4:30-5:00 ”\nPractise elocution, poise and how to attain it 5:00-6:00 ”\nStudy needed inventions                        7:00-9:00 ”\n\n      General Resolves\n\n* No wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]\n\n* No more smokeing or chewing.\n\n* Bath every other day\n\n* Read one improving book or magazine per week\n\n* Save $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week\n\n* Be better to parents\n\n“I came across this book by accident,” said the old man. “It just\nshows you, don’t it?”\n\n“It just shows you.”\n\n“Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this\nor something. Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind? He\nwas always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat\nhim for it.”\n\nHe was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then\nlooking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the\nlist for my own use.\n\nA little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and\nI began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did\nGatsby’s father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and\nstood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he\nspoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way. The minister glanced\nseveral times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait\nfor half an hour. But it wasn’t any use. Nobody came.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout five o’clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery\nand stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate—first a motor hearse,\nhorribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and me in the\nlimousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman\nfrom West Egg, in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we\nstarted through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then\nthe sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I\nlooked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found\nmarvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months\nbefore.\n\nI’d never seen him since then. I don’t know how he knew about the\nfuneral, or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, and\nhe took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled\nfrom Gatsby’s grave.\n\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already\ntoo far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that\nDaisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur\n“Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyed\nman said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice.\n\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke\nto me by the gate.\n\n“I couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked.\n\n“Neither could anybody else.”\n\n“Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they used to go there by the\nhundreds.”\n\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.\n\n“The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school\nand later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than\nChicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a\nDecember evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into\ntheir own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember\nthe fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That’s and the\nchatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught\nsight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: “Are you\ngoing to the Ordways’? the Herseys’? the Schultzes’?” and the long\ngreen tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky\nyellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking\ncheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.\n\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,\nbegan to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and\nthe dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild\nbrace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we\nwalked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware\nof our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we\nmelted indistinguishably into it again.\n\nThat’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede\ntowns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street\nlamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly\nwreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a\nlittle solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent\nfrom growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are\nstill called through decades by a family’s name. I see now that this\nhas been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and\nJordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some\ndeficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\n\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware\nof its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the\nOhio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the\nchildren and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of\ndistortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic\ndreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at\nonce conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging\nsky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress\nsuits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a\ndrunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over\nthe side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a\nhouse—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one\ncares.\n\nAfter Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted\nbeyond my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle\nleaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the\nline I decided to come back home.\n\nThere was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant\nthing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to\nleave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent\nsea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and\naround what had happened to us together, and what had happened\nafterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big\nchair.\n\nShe was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like\na good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the\ncolour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the\nfingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without\ncomment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though\nthere were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I\npretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t\nmaking a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up\nto say goodbye.\n\n“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threw\nme over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but it\nwas a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”\n\nWe shook hands.\n\n“Oh, and do you remember”—she added—“a conversation we had once about\ndriving a car?”\n\n“Why—not exactly.”\n\n“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?\nWell, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me\nto make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,\nstraightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.”\n\n“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and\ncall it honour.”\n\nShe didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously\nsorry, I turned away.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead\nof me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a\nlittle from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving\nsharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as\nI slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into\nthe windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back,\nholding out his hand.\n\n“What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?”\n\n“Yes. You know what I think of you.”\n\n“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy as hell. I don’t know\nwhat’s the matter with you.”\n\n“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”\n\nHe stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about\nthose missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after\nme and grabbed my arm.\n\n“I told him the truth,” he said. “He came to the door while we were\ngetting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in\nhe tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if\nI hadn’t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his\npocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly.\n“What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw\ndust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough\none. He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even\nstopped his car.”\n\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it\nwasn’t true.\n\n“And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when\nI went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits\nsitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By\nGod it was awful—”\n\nI couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done\nwas, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and\nconfused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up\nthings and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their\nvast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let\nother people clean up the mess they had made …\n\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as\nthough I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery\nstore to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff\nbuttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn had\ngrown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never\ntook a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and\npointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to\nEast Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story\nabout it all his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when\nI got off the train.\n\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming,\ndazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still\nhear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden,\nand the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a\nmaterial car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I\ndidn’t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away\nat the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.\n\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,\nI went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once\nmore. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a\npiece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it,\ndrawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the\nbeach and sprawled out on the sand.\n\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any\nlights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the\nSound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to\nmelt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that\nflowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new\nworld. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s\nhouse, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all\nhuman dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his\nbreath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic\ncontemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the\nlast time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for\nwonder.\n\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of\nGatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of\nDaisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream\nmust have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He\ndid not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that\nvast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic\nrolled on under the night.\n\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by\nyear recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no\nmatter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further … And\none fine morning—\n\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into\nthe past.\n\n`\n);\nexport const theHoundOfTheBaskervilles = new Book(\n  'The Hound of the Baskervilles',\n  `\nTHE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES\n\nAnother Adventure of Sherlock Holmes\n\n\nby A.

I stood upon the\n      hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left\n      behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood,\n      bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a “Penang lawyer.”\n      Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch\n      across. “To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the\n      C.C.H.,” was engraved upon it, with the date “1884.” It was just\n      such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to\n      carry—dignified, solid, and reassuring.\n\n      “Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”\n\n      Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no\n      sign of my occupation.\n\n      “How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in\n      the back of your head.”\n\n      “I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in\n      front of me,” said he. “But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of\n      our visitor’s stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss\n      him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir\n      becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an\n      examination of it.”\n\n      “I think,” said I, following as far as I could the methods of my\n      companion, “that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical\n      man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of\n      their appreciation.”\n\n      “Good!” said Holmes. “Excellent!”\n\n      “I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a\n      country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on\n      foot.”\n\n      “Why so?”\n\n      “Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has\n      been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town\n      practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so\n      it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with\n      it.”\n\n      “Perfectly sound!” said Holmes.\n\n      “And then again, there is the ‘friends of the C.C.H.’ I should\n      guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose\n      members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which\n      has made him a small presentation in return.”\n\n      “Really, Watson, you excel yourself,” said Holmes, pushing back\n      his chair and lighting a cigarette. “I am bound to say that in\n      all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own\n      small achievements you have habitually underrated your own\n      abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you\n      are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius\n      have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear\n      fellow, that I am very much in your debt.”\n\n      He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words\n      gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his\n      indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had\n      made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think\n      that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way\n      which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands\n      and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with\n      an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and\n      carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a\n      convex lens.\n\n      “Interesting, though elementary,” said he as he returned to his\n      favourite corner of the settee. “There are certainly one or two\n      indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several\n      deductions.”\n\n      “Has anything escaped me?” I asked with some self-importance. “I\n      trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have\n      overlooked?”\n\n      “I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were\n      erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be\n      frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided\n      towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this\n      instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he\n      walks a good deal.”\n\n      “Then I was right.”\n\n      “To that extent.”\n\n      “But that was all.”\n\n      “No, no, my dear Watson, not all—by no means all. I would\n      suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more\n      likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when\n      the initials ‘C.C.’ are placed before that hospital the words\n      ‘Charing Cross’ very naturally suggest themselves.”\n\n      “You may be right.”\n\n      “The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a\n      working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our\n      construction of this unknown visitor.”\n\n      “Well, then, supposing that ‘C.C.H.’ does stand for ‘Charing\n      Cross Hospital,’ what further inferences may we draw?”\n\n      “Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!”\n\n      “I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has\n      practised in town before going to the country.”\n\n      “I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look\n      at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable\n      that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends\n      unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the\n      moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the\n      hospital in order to start a practice for himself. We know there\n      has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from\n      a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching\n      our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the\n      occasion of the change?”\n\n      “It certainly seems probable.”\n\n      “Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the _staff_\n      of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London\n      practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not\n      drift into the country. What was he, then? If he was in the\n      hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a\n      house-surgeon or a house-physician—little more than a senior\n      student. And he left five years ago—the date is on the stick. So\n      your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin\n      air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under\n      thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of\n      a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger\n      than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.”\n\n      I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his\n      settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.\n\n      “As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,” said I,\n      “but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars\n      about the man’s age and professional career.” From my small\n      medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the\n      name. There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our\n      visitor. I read his record aloud.\n\n        “Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.\n        House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.\n        Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology, with\n        essay entitled ‘Is Disease a Reversion?’  Corresponding member\n        of the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of ‘Some Freaks of\n        Atavism’ (_Lancet_ 1882).  ‘Do We Progress?’ (_Journal of\n        Psychology_, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the parishes of\n        Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.”\n\n      “No mention of that local hunt, Watson,” said Holmes with a\n      mischievous smile, “but a country doctor, as you very astutely\n      observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As\n      to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable,\n      unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is\n      only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only\n      an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country,\n      and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his\n      visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.”\n\n      “And the dog?”\n\n      “Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master.\n      Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle,\n      and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog’s\n      jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in\n      my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It\n      may have been—yes, by Jove, it _is_ a curly-haired spaniel.”\n\n      He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the\n      recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his\n      voice that I glanced up in surprise.\n\n      “My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?”\n\n      “For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our\n      very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don’t move, I\n      beg you, Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your\n      presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment\n      of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is\n      walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill.\n      What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock\n      Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!”\n\n      The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had\n      expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin\n      man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two\n      keen, grey eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from\n      behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a\n      professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was\n      dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was\n      already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head\n      and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes\n      fell upon the stick in Holmes’s hand, and he ran towards it with\n      an exclamation of joy. “I am so very glad,” said he. “I was not\n      sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I\n      would not lose that stick for the world.”\n\n      “A presentation, I see,” said Holmes.\n\n      “Yes, sir.”\n\n      “From Charing Cross Hospital?”\n\n      “From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.”\n\n      “Dear, dear, that’s bad!” said Holmes, shaking his head.\n\n      Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.\n      “Why was it bad?”\n\n      “Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your\n      marriage, you say?”\n\n      “Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all\n      hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home\n      of my own.”\n\n      “Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,” said Holmes.\n      “And now, Dr. James Mortimer—”\n\n      “Mister, sir, Mister—a humble M.R.C.S.”\n\n      “And a man of precise mind, evidently.”\n\n      “A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the\n      shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr.\n      Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not—”\n\n      “No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.”\n\n      “Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in\n      connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much,\n      Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or\n      such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any\n      objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A\n      cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would\n      be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my\n      intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.”\n\n      Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. “You are\n      an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am\n      in mine,” said he. “I observe from your forefinger that you make\n      your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.”\n\n      The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the\n      other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers\n      as agile and restless as the antennæ of an insect.\n\n      Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the\n      interest which he took in our curious companion. “I presume,\n      sir,” said he at last, “that it was not merely for the purpose of\n      examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here\n      last night and again today?”\n\n      “No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of\n      doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I\n      recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am\n      suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary\n      problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest\n      expert in Europe—”\n\n      “Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?”\n      asked Holmes with some asperity.\n\n      “To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur\n      Bertillon must always appeal strongly.”\n\n      “Then had you not better consult him?”\n\n      “I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a\n      practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone.\n      I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently—”\n\n      “Just a little,” said Holmes. “I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would\n      do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly\n      what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my\n      assistance.”\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2.\nThe Curse of the Baskervilles\n\n\n      “I have in my pocket a manuscript,” said Dr. James Mortimer.\n\n      “I observed it as you entered the room,” said Holmes.\n\n      “It is an old manuscript.”\n\n      “Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.”\n\n      “How can you say that, sir?”\n\n      “You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all\n      the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert\n      who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so.\n      You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject.\n      I put that at 1730.”\n\n      “The exact date is 1742.” Dr. Mortimer drew it from his\n      breast-pocket. “This family paper was committed to my care by Sir\n      Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three\n      months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I may say\n      that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant.\n      He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as\n      unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document very\n      seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did\n      eventually overtake him.”\n\n      Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it\n      upon his knee. “You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of\n      the long _s_ and the short. It is one of several indications\n      which enabled me to fix the date.”\n\n      I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded\n      script. At the head was written: “Baskerville Hall,” and below in\n      large, scrawling figures: “1742.”\n\n      “It appears to be a statement of some sort.”\n\n      “Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the\n      Baskerville family.”\n\n      “But I understand that it is something more modern and practical\n      upon which you wish to consult me?”\n\n      “Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be\n      decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and\n      is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I\n      will read it to you.”\n\n      Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together,\n      and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer\n      turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking\n      voice the following curious, old-world narrative:\n\n        “Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been\n        many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo\n        Baskerville, and as I had the story from my father, who also\n        had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it\n        occurred even as is here set forth. And I would have you\n        believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may\n        also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy\n        but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed.  Learn\n        then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but\n        rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul\n        passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not\n        again be loosed to our undoing.\n\n            “Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the\n            history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most\n            earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of\n            Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be\n            gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless man.\n             This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing\n            that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there\n            was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his\n            name a by-word through the West.  It chanced that this Hugo\n            came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known\n            under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held\n            lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young maiden,\n            being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him,\n            for she feared his evil name.  So it came to pass that one\n            Michaelmas this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and\n            wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off\n            the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he\n            well knew.  When they had brought her to the Hall the\n            maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his\n            friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly\n            custom.  Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her\n            wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths\n            which came up to her from below, for they say that the\n            words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were\n            such as might blast the man who said them.  At last in the\n            stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted\n            the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the\n            growth of ivy which covered (and still covers) the south\n            wall she came down from under the eaves, and so homeward\n            across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall\n            and her father’s farm.\n\n            “It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his\n            guests to carry food and drink—with other worse things,\n            perchance—to his captive, and so found the cage empty and\n            the bird escaped.  Then, as it would seem, he became as one\n            that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the\n            dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table, flagons and\n            trenchers flying before him, and he cried aloud before all\n            the company that he would that very night render his body\n            and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the\n            wench.  And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of\n            the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than\n            the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon\n            her.  Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms\n            that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and\n            giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid’s, he swung them\n            to the line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the\n            moor.\n\n            “Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to\n            understand all that had been done in such haste.  But anon\n            their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which\n            was like to be done upon the moorlands.  Everything was now\n            in an uproar, some calling for their pistols, some for\n            their horses, and some for another flask of wine.  But at\n            length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and the\n            whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started\n            in pursuit.  The moon shone clear above them, and they rode\n            swiftly abreast, taking that course which the maid must\n            needs have taken if she were to reach her own home.\n\n            “They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the\n            night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him\n            to know if he had seen the hunt.  And the man, as the story\n            goes, was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak,\n            but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy\n            maiden, with the hounds upon her track.  ‘But I have seen\n            more than that,’ said he, ‘for Hugo Baskerville passed me\n            upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a\n            hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels.’ \n            So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward.\n             But soon their skins turned cold, for there came a\n            galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with\n            white froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty\n            saddle.  Then the revellers rode close together, for a\n            great fear was on them, but they still followed over the\n            moor, though each, had he been alone, would have been right\n            glad to have turned his horse’s head.  Riding slowly in\n            this fashion they came at last upon the hounds.  These,\n            though known for their valour and their breed, were\n            whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal,\n            as we call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some,\n            with starting hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the\n            narrow valley before them.\n\n            “The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may\n            guess, than when they started.  The most of them would by\n            no means advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may\n            be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal. Now, it\n            opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great\n            stones, still to be seen there, which were set by certain\n            forgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon was shining\n            bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the\n            unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of fear and of\n            fatigue.  But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was\n            it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near her,\n            which raised the hair upon the heads of these three\n            dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo,\n            and plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a\n            great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than\n            any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon.  And even\n            as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo\n            Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and\n            dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and\n            rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor.  One,\n            it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and\n            the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their\n            days.\n\n            “Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound\n            which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever\n            since.  If I have set it down it is because that which is\n            clearly known hath less terror than that which is but\n            hinted at and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that many of\n            the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have\n            been sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we shelter\n            ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence, which\n            would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or\n            fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ.  To\n            that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I\n            counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the\n            moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are\n            exalted.\n\n            “[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John,\n            with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their\n            sister Elizabeth.]”\n\n      When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he\n      pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr.\n      Sherlock Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his\n      cigarette into the fire.\n\n      “Well?” said he.\n\n      “Do you not find it interesting?”\n\n      “To a collector of fairy tales.”\n\n      Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.\n\n      “Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more\n      recent. This is the _Devon County Chronicle_ of May 14th of this\n      year. It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of\n      Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that\n      date.”\n\n      My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became\n      intent. Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:\n\n        “The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name\n        has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for\n        Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the\n        county.  Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for\n        a comparatively short period his amiability of character and\n        extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who\n        had been brought into contact with him.  In these days of\n        _nouveaux riches_ it is refreshing to find a case where the\n        scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days\n        is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him\n        to restore the fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is\n        well known, made large sums of money in South African\n        speculation. More wise than those who go on until the wheel\n        turns against them, he realised his gains and returned to\n        England with them.  It is only two years since he took up his\n        residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how large\n        were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have\n        been interrupted by his death.  Being himself childless, it was\n        his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should,\n        within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many\n        will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.  His\n        generous donations to local and county charities have been\n        frequently chronicled in these columns.\n\n            “The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles\n            cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the\n            inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of\n            those rumours to which local superstition has given rise.\n            There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to\n            imagine that death could be from any but natural causes.\n            Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to\n            have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In\n            spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his\n            personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville\n            Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the\n            husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper. Their\n            evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to\n            show that Sir Charles’s health has for some time been\n            impaired, and points especially to some affection of the\n            heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour,\n            breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.\n            Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of the\n            deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.\n\n            “The facts of the case are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville\n            was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking\n            down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.  The\n            evidence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his\n            custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his\n            intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered\n            Barrymore to prepare his luggage.  That night he went out\n            as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he\n            was in the habit of smoking a cigar.  He never returned. \n            At twelve o’clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still\n            open, became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in\n            search of his master.  The day had been wet, and Sir\n            Charles’s footmarks were easily traced down the alley. \n            Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on\n            to the moor. There were indications that Sir Charles had\n            stood for some little time here.  He then proceeded down\n            the alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body\n            was discovered. One fact which has not been explained is\n            the statement of Barrymore that his master’s footprints\n            altered their character from the time that he passed the\n            moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have\n            been walking upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy\n            horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the\n            time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the\n            worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is\n            unable to state from what direction they came.  No signs of\n            violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles’s person,\n            and though the doctor’s evidence pointed to an almost\n            incredible facial distortion—so great that Dr. Mortimer\n            refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend\n            and patient who lay before him—it was explained that that\n            is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnœa and\n            death from cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne\n            out by the post-mortem examination, which showed\n            long-standing organic disease, and the coroner’s jury\n            returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.\n             It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the\n            utmost importance that Sir Charles’s heir should settle at\n            the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly\n            interrupted.  Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not\n            finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been\n            whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been\n            difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall.  It is\n            understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville,\n            if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville’s\n            younger brother.  The young man when last heard of was in\n            America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to\n            informing him of his good fortune.”\n\n      Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket.\n      “Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the\n      death of Sir Charles Baskerville.”\n\n      “I must thank you,” said Sherlock Holmes, “for calling my\n      attention to a case which certainly presents some features of\n      interest. I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but\n      I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the\n      Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch\n      with several interesting English cases. This article, you say,\n      contains all the public facts?”\n\n      “It does.”\n\n      “Then let me have the private ones.” He leaned back, put his\n      finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial\n      expression.\n\n      “In doing so,” said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of\n      some strong emotion, “I am telling that which I have not confided\n      to anyone. My motive for withholding it from the coroner’s\n      inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in\n      the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition.\n      I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall, as the paper\n      says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to\n      increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these\n      reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less\n      than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but\n      with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.\n\n      “The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near\n      each other are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a\n      good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr.\n      Frankland, of Lafter Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist,\n      there are no other men of education within many miles. Sir\n      Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his illness brought\n      us together, and a community of interests in science kept us so.\n      He had brought back much scientific information from South\n      Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together\n      discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the\n      Hottentot.\n\n      “Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me\n      that Sir Charles’s nervous system was strained to the breaking\n      point. He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly\n      to heart—so much so that, although he would walk in his own\n      grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at\n      night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was\n      honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and\n      certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors\n      were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence\n      constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has\n      asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen\n      any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter\n      question he put to me several times, and always with a voice\n      which vibrated with excitement.\n\n      “I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some\n      three weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall\n      door. I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of\n      him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and\n      stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror. I\n      whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something\n      which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the\n      drive. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go\n      down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for\n      it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the\n      worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the\n      evening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion\n      which he had shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative\n      which I read to you when first I came. I mention this small\n      episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy\n      which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter\n      was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no\n      justification.\n\n      “It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London.\n      His heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in\n      which he lived, however chimerical the cause of it might be, was\n      evidently having a serious effect upon his health. I thought that\n      a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a\n      new man. Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned at\n      his state of health, was of the same opinion. At the last instant\n      came this terrible catastrophe.\n\n      “On the night of Sir Charles’s death Barrymore the butler, who\n      made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me,\n      and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall\n      within an hour of the event. I checked and corroborated all the\n      facts which were mentioned at the inquest. I followed the\n      footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate\n      where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the\n      shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no\n      other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and\n      finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched\n      until my arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his\n      fingers dug into the ground, and his features convulsed with some\n      strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn\n      to his identity. There was certainly no physical injury of any\n      kind. But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the\n      inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the ground round\n      the body. He did not observe any. But I did—some little distance\n      off, but fresh and clear.”\n\n      “Footprints?”\n\n      “Footprints.”\n\n      “A man’s or a woman’s?”\n\n      Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice\n      sank almost to a whisper as he answered.\n\n      “Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!”\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3.\nThe Problem\n\n\n      I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a\n      thrill in the doctor’s voice which showed that he was himself\n      deeply moved by that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in\n      his excitement and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot\n      from them when he was keenly interested.\n\n      “You saw this?”\n\n      “As clearly as I see you.”\n\n      “And you said nothing?”\n\n      “What was the use?”\n\n      “How was it that no one else saw it?”\n\n      “The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave\n      them a thought. I don’t suppose I should have done so had I not\n      known this legend.”\n\n      “There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?”\n\n      “No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.”\n\n      “You say it was large?”\n\n      “Enormous.”\n\n      “But it had not approached the body?”\n\n      “No.”\n\n      “What sort of night was it?’\n\n      “Damp and raw.”\n\n      “But not actually raining?”\n\n      “No.”\n\n      “What is the alley like?”\n\n      “There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and\n      impenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across.”\n\n      “Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?”\n\n      “Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either\n      side.”\n\n      “I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a\n      gate?”\n\n      “Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.”\n\n      “Is there any other opening?”\n\n      “None.”\n\n      “So that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it\n      from the house or else to enter it by the moor-gate?”\n\n      “There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.”\n\n      “Had Sir Charles reached this?”\n\n      “No; he lay about fifty yards from it.”\n\n      “Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer—and this is important—the marks which\n      you saw were on the path and not on the grass?”\n\n      “No marks could show on the grass.”\n\n      “Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?”\n\n      “Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the\n      moor-gate.”\n\n      “You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate\n      closed?”\n\n      “Closed and padlocked.”\n\n      “How high was it?”\n\n      “About four feet high.”\n\n      “Then anyone could have got over it?”\n\n      “Yes.”\n\n      “And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?”\n\n      “None in particular.”\n\n      “Good heaven! Did no one examine?”\n\n      “Yes, I examined, myself.”\n\n      “And found nothing?”\n\n      “It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there\n      for five or ten minutes.”\n\n      “How do you know that?”\n\n      “Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.”\n\n      “Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But\n      the marks?”\n\n      “He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I\n      could discern no others.”\n\n      Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an\n      impatient gesture.\n\n      “If I had only been there!” he cried. “It is evidently a case of\n      extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense\n      opportunities to the scientific expert. That gravel page upon\n      which I might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by\n      the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants. Oh, Dr.\n      Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you should not have called\n      me in! You have indeed much to answer for.”\n\n      “I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these\n      facts to the world, and I have already given my reasons for not\n      wishing to do so. Besides, besides—”\n\n      “Why do you hesitate?”\n\n      “There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of\n      detectives is helpless.”\n\n      “You mean that the thing is supernatural?”\n\n      “I did not positively say so.”\n\n      “No, but you evidently think it.”\n\n      “Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears\n      several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled\n      order of Nature.”\n\n      “For example?”\n\n      “I find that before the terrible event occurred several people\n      had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this\n      Baskerville demon, and which could not possibly be any animal\n      known to science. They all agreed that it was a huge creature,\n      luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I have cross-examined these men,\n      one of them a hard-headed countryman, one a farrier, and one a\n      moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful\n      apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the\n      legend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the\n      district, and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at\n      night.”\n\n      “And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be\n      supernatural?”\n\n      “I do not know what to believe.”\n\n      Holmes shrugged his shoulders. “I have hitherto confined my\n      investigations to this world,” said he. “In a modest way I have\n      combated evil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would,\n      perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the\n      footmark is material.”\n\n      “The original hound was material enough to tug a man’s throat\n      out, and yet he was diabolical as well.”\n\n      “I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But\n      now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why\n      have you come to consult me at all? You tell me in the same\n      breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles’s death, and\n      that you desire me to do it.”\n\n      “I did not say that I desired you to do it.”\n\n      “Then, how can I assist you?”\n\n      “By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry\n      Baskerville, who arrives at Waterloo Station”—Dr. Mortimer looked\n      at his watch—“in exactly one hour and a quarter.”\n\n      “He being the heir?”\n\n      “Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young\n      gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the\n      accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every\n      way. I speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and\n      executor of Sir Charles’s will.”\n\n      “There is no other claimant, I presume?”\n\n      “None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was\n      Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor\n      Sir Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is\n      the father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black\n      sheep of the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville\n      strain and was the very image, they tell me, of the family\n      picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold him, fled to\n      Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is\n      the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes I meet\n      him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived at\n      Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise\n      me to do with him?”\n\n      “Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?”\n\n      “It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every\n      Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure\n      that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he\n      would have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old\n      race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet\n      it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak\n      countryside depends upon his presence. All the good work which\n      has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is\n      no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by\n      my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring\n      the case before you and ask for your advice.”\n\n      Holmes considered for a little time.\n\n      “Put into plain words, the matter is this,” said he. “In your\n      opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an\n      unsafe abode for a Baskerville—that is your opinion?”\n\n      “At least I might go the length of saying that there is some\n      evidence that this may be so.”\n\n      “Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it\n      could work the young man evil in London as easily as in\n      Devonshire. A devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry\n      would be too inconceivable a thing.”\n\n      “You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would\n      probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these\n      things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young\n      man will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty\n      minutes. What would you recommend?”\n\n      “I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who\n      is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet\n      Sir Henry Baskerville.”\n\n      “And then?”\n\n      “And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up\n      my mind about the matter.”\n\n      “How long will it take you to make up your mind?”\n\n      “Twenty-four hours. At ten o’clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will\n      be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will\n      be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir\n      Henry Baskerville with you.”\n\n      “I will do so, Mr. Holmes.” He scribbled the appointment on his\n      shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded\n      fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.\n\n      “Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir\n      Charles Baskerville’s death several people saw this apparition\n      upon the moor?”\n\n      “Three people did.”\n\n      “Did any see it after?”\n\n      “I have not heard of any.”\n\n      “Thank you. Good-morning.”\n\n      Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward\n      satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.\n\n      “Going out, Watson?”\n\n      “Unless I can help you.”\n\n      “No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to\n      you for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points\n      of view. When you pass Bradley’s, would you ask him to send up a\n      pound of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as\n      well if you could make it convenient not to return before\n      evening. Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to\n      this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this\n      morning.”\n\n      I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my\n      friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during\n      which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed\n      alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up\n      his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial.\n      I therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to Baker\n      Street until evening. It was nearly nine o’clock when I found\n      myself in the sitting-room once more.\n\n      My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had\n      broken out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light\n      of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered,\n      however, my fears were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of\n      strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me\n      coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in his\n      dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe\n      between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.\n\n      “Caught cold, Watson?” said he.\n\n      “No, it’s this poisonous atmosphere.”\n\n      “I suppose it _is_ pretty thick, now that you mention it.”\n\n      “Thick! It is intolerable.”\n\n      “Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I\n      perceive.”\n\n      “My dear Holmes!”\n\n      “Am I right?”\n\n      “Certainly, but how?”\n\n      He laughed at my bewildered expression. “There is a delightful\n      freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to\n      exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense. A\n      gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns\n      immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his\n      boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man\n      with intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not\n      obvious?”\n\n      “Well, it is rather obvious.”\n\n      “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance\n      ever observes. Where do you think that I have been?”\n\n      “A fixture also.”\n\n      “On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.”\n\n      “In spirit?”\n\n      “Exactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret\n      to observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and\n      an incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to\n      Stamford’s for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and\n      my spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I\n      could find my way about.”\n\n      “A large-scale map, I presume?”\n\n      “Very large.”\n\n      He unrolled one section and held it over his knee. “Here you have\n      the particular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville\n      Hall in the middle.”\n\n      “With a wood round it?”\n\n      “Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that\n      name, must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you\n      perceive, upon the right of it. This small clump of buildings\n      here is the hamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has\n      his headquarters. Within a radius of five miles there are, as you\n      see, only a very few scattered dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall,\n      which was mentioned in the narrative. There is a house indicated\n      here which may be the residence of the naturalist—Stapleton, if I\n      remember right, was his name. Here are two moorland farmhouses,\n      High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the great convict\n      prison of Princetown. Between and around these scattered points\n      extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage\n      upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to\n      play it again.”\n\n      “It must be a wild place.”\n\n      “Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to\n      have a hand in the affairs of men—”\n\n      “Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural\n      explanation.”\n\n      “The devil’s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?\n      There are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is\n      whether any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what\n      is the crime and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr.\n      Mortimer’s surmise should be correct, and we are dealing with\n      forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature, there is an end of\n      our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all other\n      hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we’ll shut\n      that window again, if you don’t mind. It is a singular thing, but\n      I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of\n      thought. I have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box\n      to think, but that is the logical outcome of my convictions. Have\n      you turned the case over in your mind?”\n\n      “Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.”\n\n      “What do you make of it?”\n\n      “It is very bewildering.”\n\n      “It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of\n      distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example.\n      What do you make of that?”\n\n      “Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that\n      portion of the alley.”\n\n      “He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why\n      should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?”\n\n      “What then?”\n\n      “He was running, Watson—running desperately, running for his\n      life, running until he burst his heart—and fell dead upon his\n      face.”\n\n      “Running from what?”\n\n      “There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was\n      crazed with fear before ever he began to run.”\n\n      “How can you say that?”\n\n      “I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across\n      the moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man\n      who had lost his wits would have run _from_ the house instead of\n      towards it. If the gipsy’s evidence may be taken as true, he ran\n      with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely\n      to be. Then, again, whom was he waiting for that night, and why\n      was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own\n      house?”\n\n      “You think that he was waiting for someone?”\n\n      “The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an\n      evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement.\n      Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as\n      Dr. Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given\n      him credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?”\n\n      “But he went out every evening.”\n\n      “I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every\n      evening. On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the\n      moor. That night he waited there. It was the night before he made\n      his departure for London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It\n      becomes coherent. Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we\n      will postpone all further thought upon this business until we\n      have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry\n      Baskerville in the morning.”\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4.\nSir Henry Baskerville\n\n\n      Our breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his\n      dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were\n      punctual to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten\n      when Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet.\n      The latter was a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years\n      of age, very sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a\n      strong, pugnacious face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and\n      had the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of\n      his time in the open air, and yet there was something in his\n      steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated\n      the gentleman.\n\n      “This is Sir Henry Baskerville,” said Dr. Mortimer.\n\n      “Why, yes,” said he, “and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock\n      Holmes, that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to\n      you this morning I should have come on my own account. I\n      understand that you think out little puzzles, and I’ve had one\n      this morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give\n      it.”\n\n      “Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you\n      have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in\n      London?”\n\n      “Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as\n      not. It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which\n      reached me this morning.”\n\n      He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It\n      was of common quality, greyish in colour. The address, “Sir Henry\n      Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel,” was printed in rough\n      characters; the post-mark “Charing Cross,” and the date of\n      posting the preceding evening.\n\n      “Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?” asked\n      Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.\n\n      “No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr.\n      Mortimer.”\n\n      “But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?”\n\n      “No, I had been staying with a friend,” said the doctor.\n\n      “There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this\n      hotel.”\n\n      “Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your\n      movements.” Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap\n      paper folded into four. This he opened and spread flat upon the\n      table. Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed\n      by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it. It ran:\n\n        As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.\n\n      The word “moor” only was printed in ink.\n\n      “Now,” said Sir Henry Baskerville, “perhaps you will tell me, Mr.\n      Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is\n      that takes so much interest in my affairs?”\n\n      “What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there\n      is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?”\n\n      “No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was\n      convinced that the business is supernatural.”\n\n      “What business?” asked Sir Henry sharply. “It seems to me that\n      all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own\n      affairs.”\n\n      “You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir\n      Henry. I promise you that,” said Sherlock Holmes. “We will\n      confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this\n      very interesting document, which must have been put together and\n      posted yesterday evening. Have you yesterday’s _Times_, Watson?”\n\n      “It is here in the corner.”\n\n      “Might I trouble you for it—the inside page, please, with the\n      leading articles?” He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes\n      up and down the columns. “Capital article this on free trade.\n      Permit me to give you an extract from it.\n\n     ‘You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or\n     your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but\n     it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run\n     keep away wealth from the country, diminish the value of our\n     imports, and lower the general conditions of life in this island.’\n\n      “What do you think of that, Watson?” cried Holmes in high glee,\n      rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. “Don’t you think\n      that is an admirable sentiment?”\n\n      Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional\n      interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark\n      eyes upon me.\n\n      “I don’t know much about the tariff and things of that kind,”\n      said he, “but it seems to me we’ve got a bit off the trail so far\n      as that note is concerned.”\n\n      “On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail,\n      Sir Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do,\n      but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of\n      this sentence.”\n\n      “No, I confess that I see no connection.”\n\n      “And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection\n      that the one is extracted out of the other. ‘You,’ ‘your,’\n      ‘your,’ ‘life,’ ‘reason,’ ‘value,’ ‘keep away,’ ‘from the.’ Don’t\n      you see now whence these words have been taken?”\n\n      “By thunder, you’re right! Well, if that isn’t smart!” cried Sir\n      Henry.\n\n      “If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that\n      ‘keep away’ and ‘from the’ are cut out in one piece.”\n\n      “Well, now—so it is!”\n\n      “Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have\n      imagined,” said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement.\n      “I could understand anyone saying that the words were from a\n      newspaper; but that you should name which, and add that it came\n      from the leading article, is really one of the most remarkable\n      things which I have ever known. How did you do it?”\n\n      “I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from\n      that of an Esquimau?”\n\n      “Most certainly.”\n\n      “But how?”\n\n      “Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious.\n      The supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve,\n      the—”\n\n      “But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally\n      obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the\n      leaded bourgeois type of a _Times_ article and the slovenly print\n      of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your\n      negro and your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the\n      most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in\n      crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I\n      confused the _Leeds Mercury_ with the _Western Morning News_. But\n      a _Times_ leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could\n      have been taken from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the\n      strong probability was that we should find the words in\n      yesterday’s issue.”\n\n      “So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,” said Sir Henry\n      Baskerville, “someone cut out this message with a scissors—”\n\n      “Nail-scissors,” said Holmes. “You can see that it was a very\n      short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips\n      over ‘keep away.’”\n\n      “That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of\n      short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste—”\n\n      “Gum,” said Holmes.\n\n      “With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word ‘moor’\n      should have been written?”\n\n      “Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all\n      simple and might be found in any issue, but ‘moor’ would be less\n      common.”\n\n      “Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything\n      else in this message, Mr. Holmes?”\n\n      “There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have\n      been taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is\n      printed in rough characters. But the _Times_ is a paper which is\n      seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. We\n      may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an\n      educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his\n      effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing\n      might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you will\n      observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but\n      that some are much higher than others. ‘Life,’ for example is\n      quite out of its proper place. That may point to carelessness or\n      it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter.\n      On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was\n      evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such\n      a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up the\n      interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any\n      letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he\n      would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption—and\n      from whom?”\n\n      “We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,” said Dr.\n      Mortimer.\n\n      “Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and\n      choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the\n      imagination, but we have always some material basis on which to\n      start our speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt,\n      but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a\n      hotel.”\n\n      “How in the world can you say that?”\n\n      “If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and\n      the ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered\n      twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short\n      address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle.\n      Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such\n      a state, and the combination of the two must be quite rare. But\n      you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get\n      anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that\n      could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around\n      Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated _Times_\n      leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent\n      this singular message. Halloa! Halloa! What’s this?”\n\n      He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words\n      were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.\n\n      “Well?”\n\n      “Nothing,” said he, throwing it down. “It is a blank half-sheet\n      of paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have\n      drawn as much as we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir\n      Henry, has anything else of interest happened to you since you\n      have been in London?”\n\n      “Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.”\n\n      “You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?”\n\n      “I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,”\n      said our visitor. “Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch\n      me?”\n\n      “We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us\n      before we go into this matter?”\n\n      “Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.”\n\n      “I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth\n      reporting.”\n\n      Sir Henry smiled. “I don’t know much of British life yet, for I\n      have spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But I\n      hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary\n      routine of life over here.”\n\n      “You have lost one of your boots?”\n\n      “My dear sir,” cried Dr. Mortimer, “it is only mislaid. You will\n      find it when you return to the hotel. What is the use of\n      troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind?”\n\n      “Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.”\n\n      “Exactly,” said Holmes, “however foolish the incident may seem.\n      You have lost one of your boots, you say?”\n\n      “Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last\n      night, and there was only one in the morning. I could get no\n      sense out of the chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I\n      only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never\n      had them on.”\n\n      “If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be\n      cleaned?”\n\n      “They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I\n      put them out.”\n\n      “Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you\n      went out at once and bought a pair of boots?”\n\n      “I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with\n      me. You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the\n      part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways\n      out West. Among other things I bought these brown boots—gave six\n      dollars for them—and had one stolen before ever I had them on my\n      feet.”\n\n      “It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,” said Sherlock\n      Holmes. “I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer’s belief that it\n      will not be long before the missing boot is found.”\n\n      “And, now, gentlemen,” said the baronet with decision, “it seems\n      to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I\n      know. It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full\n      account of what we are all driving at.”\n\n      “Your request is a very reasonable one,” Holmes answered. “Dr.\n      Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story\n      as you told it to us.”\n\n      Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his\n      pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the\n      morning before. Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest\n      attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise.\n\n      “Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,”\n      said he when the long narrative was finished. “Of course, I’ve\n      heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery. It’s the pet\n      story of the family, though I never thought of taking it\n      seriously before. But as to my uncle’s death—well, it all seems\n      boiling up in my head, and I can’t get it clear yet. You don’t\n      seem quite to have made up your mind whether it’s a case for a\n      policeman or a clergyman.”\n\n      “Precisely.”\n\n      “And now there’s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I\n      suppose that fits into its place.”\n\n      “It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what\n      goes on upon the moor,” said Dr. Mortimer.\n\n      “And also,” said Holmes, “that someone is not ill-disposed\n      towards you, since they warn you of danger.”\n\n      “Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me\n      away.”\n\n      “Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted\n      to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which\n      presents several interesting alternatives. But the practical\n      point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or\n      is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall.”\n\n      “Why should I not go?”\n\n      “There seems to be danger.”\n\n      “Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger\n      from human beings?”\n\n      “Well, that is what we have to find out.”\n\n      “Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell,\n      Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me\n      from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to\n      be my final answer.” His dark brows knitted and his face flushed\n      to a dusky red as he spoke. It was evident that the fiery temper\n      of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their last\n      representative. “Meanwhile,” said he, “I have hardly had time to\n      think over all that you have told me. It’s a big thing for a man\n      to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like\n      to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look\n      here, Mr. Holmes, it’s half-past eleven now and I am going back\n      right away to my hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson,\n      come round and lunch with us at two. I’ll be able to tell you\n      more clearly then how this thing strikes me.”\n\n      “Is that convenient to you, Watson?”\n\n      “Perfectly.”\n\n      “Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?”\n\n      “I’d prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.”\n\n      “I’ll join you in a walk, with pleasure,” said his companion.\n\n      “Then we meet again at two o’clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!”\n\n      We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang\n      of the front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the\n      languid dreamer to the man of action.\n\n      “Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!” He\n      rushed into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a\n      few seconds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs\n      and into the street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still\n      visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of\n      Oxford Street.\n\n      “Shall I run on and stop them?”\n\n      “Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with\n      your company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for\n      it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk.”\n\n      He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which\n      divided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards\n      behind, we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street.\n      Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon\n      which Holmes did the same. An instant afterwards he gave a little\n      cry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eager\n      eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted\n      on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward\n      again.\n\n      “There’s our man, Watson! Come along! We’ll have a good look at\n      him, if we can do no more.”\n\n      At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of\n      piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.\n      Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed\n      to the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street.\n      Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in\n      sight. Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the\n      traffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was out\n      of sight.\n\n      “There now!” said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white\n      with vexation from the tide of vehicles. “Was ever such bad luck\n      and such bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an\n      honest man you will record this also and set it against my\n      successes!”\n\n      “Who was the man?”\n\n      “I have not an idea.”\n\n      “A spy?”\n\n      “Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville\n      has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in\n      town. How else could it be known so quickly that it was the\n      Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen? If they had followed\n      him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the\n      second. You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the\n      window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.”\n\n      “Yes, I remember.”\n\n      “I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none.\n      We are dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very\n      deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is\n      a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I\n      am conscious always of power and design. When our friends left I\n      at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their\n      invisible attendant. So wily was he that he had not trusted\n      himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so that he\n      could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice.\n      His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take\n      a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one\n      obvious disadvantage.”\n\n      “It puts him in the power of the cabman.”\n\n      “Exactly.”\n\n      “What a pity we did not get the number!”\n\n      “My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not\n      seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 is\n      our man. But that is no use to us for the moment.”\n\n      “I fail to see how you could have done more.”\n\n      “On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked\n      in the other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a\n      second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or,\n      better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited\n      there. When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should\n      have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and\n      seeing where he made for. As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness,\n      which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and\n      energy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost our\n      man.”\n\n      We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this\n      conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long\n      vanished in front of us.\n\n      “There is no object in our following them,” said Holmes. “The\n      shadow has departed and will not return. We must see what further\n      cards we have in our hands and play them with decision. Could you\n      swear to that man’s face within the cab?”\n\n      “I could swear only to the beard.”\n\n      “And so could I—from which I gather that in all probability it\n      was a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no\n      use for a beard save to conceal his features. Come in here,\n      Watson!”\n\n      He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he\n      was warmly greeted by the manager.\n\n      “Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in\n      which I had the good fortune to help you?”\n\n      “No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps\n      my life.”\n\n      “My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection,\n      Wilson, that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who\n      showed some ability during the investigation.”\n\n      “Yes, sir, he is still with us.”\n\n      “Could you ring him up?—thank you! And I should be glad to have\n      change of this five-pound note.”\n\n      A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the\n      summons of the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence\n      at the famous detective.\n\n      “Let me have the Hotel Directory,” said Holmes. “Thank you! Now,\n      Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all\n      in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?”\n\n      “Yes, sir.”\n\n      “You will visit each of these in turn.”\n\n      “Yes, sir.”\n\n      “You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one\n      shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings.”\n\n      “Yes, sir.”\n\n      “You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of\n      yesterday. You will say that an important telegram has miscarried\n      and that you are looking for it. You understand?”\n\n      “Yes, sir.”\n\n      “But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the\n      _Times_ with some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy\n      of the _Times_. It is this page. You could easily recognize it,\n      could you not?”\n\n      “Yes, sir.”\n\n      “In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter,\n      to whom also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three\n      shillings. You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of\n      the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned\n      or removed. In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of\n      paper and you will look for this page of the _Times_ among it.\n      The odds are enormously against your finding it. There are ten\n      shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a report by\n      wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only\n      remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman,\n      No. 2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street\n      picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the\n      hotel.”\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5.\nThree Broken Threads\n\n\n      Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of\n      detaching his mind at will. For two hours the strange business in\n      which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was\n      entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian masters.\n      He would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the crudest\n      ideas, from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at\n      the Northumberland Hotel.\n\n      “Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,” said the\n      clerk. “He asked me to show you up at once when you came.”\n\n      “Have you any objection to my looking at your register?” said\n      Holmes.\n\n      “Not in the least.”\n\n      The book showed that two names had been added after that of\n      Baskerville. One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle;\n      the other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.\n\n      “Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,” said\n      Holmes to the porter. “A lawyer, is he not, grey-headed, and\n      walks with a limp?”\n\n      “No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active\n      gentleman, not older than yourself.”\n\n      “Surely you are mistaken about his trade?”\n\n      “No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very\n      well known to us.”\n\n      “Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the\n      name. Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend\n      one finds another.”\n\n      “She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of\n      Gloucester. She always comes to us when she is in town.”\n\n      “Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have\n      established a most important fact by these questions, Watson,” he\n      continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. “We know\n      now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not\n      settled down in his own hotel. That means that while they are, as\n      we have seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious\n      that he should not see them. Now, this is a most suggestive\n      fact.”\n\n      “What does it suggest?”\n\n      “It suggests—halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the\n      matter?”\n\n      As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir\n      Henry Baskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and\n      he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was\n      he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it was in\n      a much broader and more Western dialect than any which we had\n      heard from him in the morning.\n\n      “Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,” he\n      cried. “They’ll find they’ve started in to monkey with the wrong\n      man unless they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can’t find\n      my missing boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the\n      best, Mr. Holmes, but they’ve got a bit over the mark this time.”\n\n      “Still looking for your boot?”\n\n      “Yes, sir, and mean to find it.”\n\n      “But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?”\n\n      “So it was, sir. And now it’s an old black one.”\n\n      “What! you don’t mean to say—?”\n\n      “That’s just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in the\n      world—the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers,\n      which I am wearing. Last night they took one of my brown ones,\n      and today they have sneaked one of the black. Well, have you got\n      it? Speak out, man, and don’t stand staring!”\n\n      An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.\n\n      “No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear\n      no word of it.”\n\n      “Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I’ll see the\n      manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.”\n\n      “It shall be found, sir—I promise you that if you will have a\n      little patience it will be found.”\n\n      “Mind it is, for it’s the last thing of mine that I’ll lose in\n      this den of thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you’ll excuse my\n      troubling you about such a trifle—”\n\n      “I think it’s well worth troubling about.”\n\n      “Why, you look very serious over it.”\n\n      “How do you explain it?”\n\n      “I just don’t attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest,\n      queerest thing that ever happened to me.”\n\n      “The queerest perhaps—” said Holmes thoughtfully.\n\n      “What do you make of it yourself?”\n\n      “Well, I don’t profess to understand it yet. This case of yours\n      is very complex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your\n      uncle’s death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of\n      capital importance which I have handled there is one which cuts\n      so deep. But we hold several threads in our hands, and the odds\n      are that one or other of them guides us to the truth. We may\n      waste time in following the wrong one, but sooner or later we\n      must come upon the right.”\n\n      We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the\n      business which had brought us together. It was in the private\n      sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked\n      Baskerville what were his intentions.\n\n      “To go to Baskerville Hall.”\n\n      “And when?”\n\n      “At the end of the week.”\n\n      “On the whole,” said Holmes, “I think that your decision is a\n      wise one. I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in\n      London, and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult\n      to discover who these people are or what their object can be. If\n      their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and we\n      should be powerless to prevent it. You did not know, Dr.\n      Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?”\n\n      Dr. Mortimer started violently. “Followed! By whom?”\n\n      “That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among\n      your neighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a\n      black, full beard?”\n\n      “No—or, let me see—why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles’s butler, is\n      a man with a full, black beard.”\n\n      “Ha! Where is Barrymore?”\n\n      “He is in charge of the Hall.”\n\n      “We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any\n      possibility he might be in London.”\n\n      “How can you do that?”\n\n      “Give me a telegraph form. ‘Is all ready for Sir Henry?’ That\n      will do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the\n      nearest telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a\n      second wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: ‘Telegram to Mr.\n      Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand. If absent, please\n      return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.’ That\n      should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his\n      post in Devonshire or not.”\n\n      “That’s so,” said Baskerville. “By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is\n      this Barrymore, anyhow?”\n\n      “He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have\n      looked after the Hall for four generations now. So far as I know,\n      he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the\n      county.”\n\n      “At the same time,” said Baskerville, “it’s clear enough that so\n      long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people\n      have a mighty fine home and nothing to do.”\n\n      “That is true.”\n\n      “Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles’s will?” asked\n      Holmes.\n\n      “He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.”\n\n      “Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?”\n\n      “Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions\n      of his will.”\n\n      “That is very interesting.”\n\n      “I hope,” said Dr. Mortimer, “that you do not look with\n      suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir\n      Charles, for I also had a thousand pounds left to me.”\n\n      “Indeed! And anyone else?”\n\n      “There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large\n      number of public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.”\n\n      “And how much was the residue?”\n\n      “Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.”\n\n      Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. “I had no idea that so\n      gigantic a sum was involved,” said he.\n\n      “Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not\n      know how very rich he was until we came to examine his\n      securities. The total value of the estate was close on to a\n      million.”\n\n      “Dear me! It is a stake for which a man might well play a\n      desperate game. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing\n      that anything happened to our young friend here—you will forgive\n      the unpleasant hypothesis!—who would inherit the estate?”\n\n      “Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles’s younger brother died\n      unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are\n      distant cousins. James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in\n      Westmoreland.”\n\n      “Thank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met\n      Mr. James Desmond?”\n\n      “Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of\n      venerable appearance and of saintly life. I remember that he\n      refused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles, though he\n      pressed it upon him.”\n\n      “And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles’s\n      thousands.”\n\n      “He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He\n      would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed\n      otherwise by the present owner, who can, of course, do what he\n      likes with it.”\n\n      “And have you made your will, Sir Henry?”\n\n      “No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I’ve had no time, for it was only\n      yesterday that I learned how matters stood. But in any case I\n      feel that the money should go with the title and estate. That was\n      my poor uncle’s idea. How is the owner going to restore the\n      glories of the Baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up\n      the property? House, land, and dollars must go together.”\n\n      “Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the\n      advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay.\n      There is only one provision which I must make. You certainly must\n      not go alone.”\n\n      “Dr. Mortimer returns with me.”\n\n      “But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house is\n      miles away from yours. With all the goodwill in the world he may\n      be unable to help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with you\n      someone, a trusty man, who will be always by your side.”\n\n      “Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?”\n\n      “If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in\n      person; but you can understand that, with my extensive consulting\n      practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many\n      quarters, it is impossible for me to be absent from London for an\n      indefinite time. At the present instant one of the most revered\n      names in England is being besmirched by a blackmailer, and only I\n      can stop a disastrous scandal. You will see how impossible it is\n      for me to go to Dartmoor.”\n\n      “Whom would you recommend, then?”\n\n      Holmes laid his hand upon my arm. “If my friend would undertake\n      it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when\n      you are in a tight place. No one can say so more confidently than\n      I.”\n\n      The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had\n      time to answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it\n      heartily.\n\n      “Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson,” said he. “You\n      see how it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter\n      as I do. If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me\n      through I’ll never forget it.”\n\n      The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I\n      was complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with\n      which the baronet hailed me as a companion.\n\n      “I will come, with pleasure,” said I. “I do not know how I could\n      employ my time better.”\n\n      “And you will report very carefully to me,” said Holmes. “When a\n      crisis comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I\n      suppose that by Saturday all might be ready?”\n\n      “Would that suit Dr. Watson?”\n\n      “Perfectly.”\n\n      “Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet\n      at the ten-thirty train from Paddington.”\n\n      We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry of triumph,\n      and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown\n      boot from under a cabinet.\n\n      “My missing boot!” he cried.\n\n      “May all our difficulties vanish as easily!” said Sherlock\n      Holmes.\n\n      “But it is a very singular thing,” Dr. Mortimer remarked. “I\n      searched this room carefully before lunch.”\n\n      “And so did I,” said Baskerville. “Every inch of it.”\n\n      “There was certainly no boot in it then.”\n\n      “In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were\n      lunching.”\n\n      The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the\n      matter, nor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been\n      added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small\n      mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting\n      aside the whole grim story of Sir Charles’s death, we had a line\n      of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days,\n      which included the receipt of the printed letter, the\n      black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown boot,\n      the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new\n      brown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to\n      Baker Street, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that\n      his mind, like my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some\n      scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected\n      episodes could be fitted. All afternoon and late into the evening\n      he sat lost in tobacco and thought.\n\n      Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:\n\n      Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.\n\n      The second:\n\n      Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry to report\n      unable to trace cut sheet of _Times_. CARTWRIGHT.\n\n      “There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more\n      stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. We\n      must cast round for another scent.”\n\n      “We have still the cabman who drove the spy.”\n\n      “Exactly. I have wired to get his name and address from the\n      Official Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an\n      answer to my question.”\n\n      The ring at the bell proved to be something even more\n      satisfactory than an answer, however, for the door opened and a\n      rough-looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself.\n\n      “I got a message from the head office that a gent at this address\n      had been inquiring for No. 2704,” said he. “I’ve driven my cab\n      this seven years and never a word of complaint. I came here\n      straight from the Yard to ask you to your face what you had\n      against me.”\n\n      “I have nothing in the world against you, my good man,” said\n      Holmes. “On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you\n      will give me a clear answer to my questions.”\n\n      “Well, I’ve had a good day and no mistake,” said the cabman with\n      a grin. “What was it you wanted to ask, sir?”\n\n      “First of all your name and address, in case I want you again.”\n\n      “John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of\n      Shipley’s Yard, near Waterloo Station.”\n\n      Sherlock Holmes made a note of it.\n\n      “Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched\n      this house at ten o’clock this morning and afterwards followed\n      the two gentlemen down Regent Street.”\n\n      The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. “Why, there’s\n      no good my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I\n      do already,” said he. “The truth is that the gentleman told me\n      that he was a detective and that I was to say nothing about him\n      to anyone.”\n\n      “My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may\n      find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide\n      anything from me. You say that your fare told you that he was a\n      detective?”\n\n      “Yes, he did.”\n\n      “When did he say this?”\n\n      “When he left me.”\n\n      “Did he say anything more?”\n\n      “He mentioned his name.”\n\n      Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. “Oh, he mentioned\n      his name, did he? That was imprudent. What was the name that he\n      mentioned?”\n\n      “His name,” said the cabman, “was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.”\n\n      Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by\n      the cabman’s reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement.\n      Then he burst into a hearty laugh.\n\n      “A touch, Watson—an undeniable touch!” said he. “I feel a foil as\n      quick and supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily\n      that time. So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?”\n\n      “Yes, sir, that was the gentleman’s name.”\n\n      “Excellent! Tell me where you picked him up and all that\n      occurred.”\n\n      “He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He said that\n      he was a detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do\n      exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad\n      enough to agree. First we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel\n      and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from\n      the rank. We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near\n      here.”\n\n      “This very door,” said Holmes.\n\n      “Well, I couldn’t be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew\n      all about it. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an\n      hour and a half. Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and\n      we followed down Baker Street and along—”\n\n      “I know,” said Holmes.\n\n      “Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my\n      gentleman threw up the trap, and he cried that I should drive\n      right away to Waterloo Station as hard as I could go. I whipped\n      up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes. Then he paid\n      up his two guineas, like a good one, and away he went into the\n      station. Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said:\n      ‘It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr.\n      Sherlock Holmes.’ That’s how I come to know the name.”\n\n      “I see. And you saw no more of him?”\n\n      “Not after he went into the station.”\n\n      “And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”\n\n      The cabman scratched his head. “Well, he wasn’t altogether such\n      an easy gentleman to describe. I’d put him at forty years of age,\n      and he was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than\n      you, sir. He was dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard,\n      cut square at the end, and a pale face. I don’t know as I could\n      say more than that.”\n\n      “Colour of his eyes?”\n\n      “No, I can’t say that.”\n\n      “Nothing more that you can remember?”\n\n      “No, sir; nothing.”\n\n      “Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There’s another one\n      waiting for you if you can bring any more information.\n      Good-night!”\n\n      “Good-night, sir, and thank you!”\n\n      John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a\n      shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile.\n\n      “Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,” said he.\n      “The cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry\n      Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,\n      conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my\n      hands on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message. I\n      tell you, Watson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of\n      our steel. I’ve been checkmated in London. I can only wish you\n      better luck in Devonshire. But I’m not easy in my mind about it.”\n\n      “About what?”\n\n      “About sending you. It’s an ugly business, Watson, an ugly\n      dangerous business, and the more I see of it the less I like it.\n      Yes, my dear fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I\n      shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker\n      Street once more.”\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6.\nBaskerville Hall\n\n\n      Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the\n      appointed day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr.\n      Sherlock Holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last\n      parting injunctions and advice.\n\n      “I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions,\n      Watson,” said he; “I wish you simply to report facts in the\n      fullest possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the\n      theorizing.”\n\n      “What sort of facts?” I asked.\n\n      “Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon\n      the case, and especially the relations between young Baskerville\n      and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death\n      of Sir Charles. I have made some inquiries myself in the last few\n      days, but the results have, I fear, been negative. One thing only\n      appears to be certain, and that is that Mr. James Desmond, who is\n      the next heir, is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable\n      disposition, so that this persecution does not arise from him. I\n      really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our\n      calculations. There remain the people who will actually surround\n      Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.”\n\n      “Would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this\n      Barrymore couple?”\n\n      “By no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they are\n      innocent it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we\n      should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them. No,\n      no, we will preserve them upon our list of suspects. Then there\n      is a groom at the Hall, if I remember right. There are two\n      moorland farmers. There is our friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I\n      believe to be entirely honest, and there is his wife, of whom we\n      know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton, and there is\n      his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions. There\n      is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor,\n      and there are one or two other neighbours. These are the folk who\n      must be your very special study.”\n\n      “I will do my best.”\n\n      “You have arms, I suppose?”\n\n      “Yes, I thought it as well to take them.”\n\n      “Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day, and\n      never relax your precautions.”\n\n      Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were\n      waiting for us upon the platform.\n\n      “No, we have no news of any kind,” said Dr. Mortimer in answer to\n      my friend’s questions. “I can swear to one thing, and that is\n      that we have not been shadowed during the last two days. We have\n      never gone out without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could\n      have escaped our notice.”\n\n      “You have always kept together, I presume?”\n\n      “Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day to pure\n      amusement when I come to town, so I spent it at the Museum of the\n      College of Surgeons.”\n\n      “And I went to look at the folk in the park,” said Baskerville.\n\n      “But we had no trouble of any kind.”\n\n      “It was imprudent, all the same,” said Holmes, shaking his head\n      and looking very grave. “I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go\n      about alone. Some great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did\n      you get your other boot?”\n\n      “No, sir, it is gone forever.”\n\n      “Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye,” he added as\n      the train began to glide down the platform. “Bear in mind, Sir\n      Henry, one of the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr.\n      Mortimer has read to us, and avoid the moor in those hours of\n      darkness when the powers of evil are exalted.”\n\n      I looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and\n      saw the tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and\n      gazing after us.\n\n      The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in\n      making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in\n      playing with Dr. Mortimer’s spaniel. In a very few hours the\n      brown earth had become ruddy, the brick had changed to granite,\n      and red cows grazed in well-hedged fields where the lush grasses\n      and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer, if a damper,\n      climate. Young Baskerville stared eagerly out of the window and\n      cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features\n      of the Devon scenery.\n\n      “I’ve been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr.\n      Watson,” said he; “but I have never seen a place to compare with\n      it.”\n\n      “I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county,” I\n      remarked.\n\n      “It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the\n      county,” said Dr. Mortimer. “A glance at our friend here reveals\n      the rounded head of the Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic\n      enthusiasm and power of attachment. Poor Sir Charles’s head was\n      of a very rare type, half Gaelic, half Ivernian in its\n      characteristics. But you were very young when you last saw\n      Baskerville Hall, were you not?”\n\n      “I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father’s death and had\n      never seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the\n      South Coast. Thence I went straight to a friend in America. I\n      tell you it is all as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I’m\n      as keen as possible to see the moor.”\n\n      “Are you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your\n      first sight of the moor,” said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the\n      carriage window.\n\n      Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood\n      there rose in the distance a grey, melancholy hill, with a\n      strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some\n      fantastic landscape in a dream. Baskerville sat for a long time,\n      his eyes fixed upon it, and I read upon his eager face how much\n      it meant to him, this first sight of that strange spot where the\n      men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so\n      deep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his American accent,\n      in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as I looked\n      at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true a\n      descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and\n      masterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his\n      thick brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If\n      on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should\n      lie before us, this was at least a comrade for whom one might\n      venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely\n      share it.\n\n      The train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all\n      descended. Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with\n      a pair of cobs was waiting. Our coming was evidently a great\n      event, for station-master and porters clustered round us to carry\n      out our luggage. It was a sweet, simple country spot, but I was\n      surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly\n      men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles and\n      glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a hard-faced,\n      gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in a\n      few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road.\n      Rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old\n      gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but\n      behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark\n      against the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the moor,\n      broken by the jagged and sinister hills.\n\n      The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward\n      through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on\n      either side, heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart’s-tongue\n      ferns. Bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light\n      of the sinking sun. Still steadily rising, we passed over a\n      narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which gushed\n      swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the grey boulders. Both\n      road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak\n      and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of\n      delight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless\n      questions. To his eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of\n      melancholy lay upon the countryside, which bore so clearly the\n      mark of the waning year. Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and\n      fluttered down upon us as we passed. The rattle of our wheels\n      died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation—sad\n      gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw before the\n      carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.\n\n      “Halloa!” cried Dr. Mortimer, “what is this?”\n\n      A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor,\n      lay in front of us. On the summit, hard and clear like an\n      equestrian statue upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark\n      and stern, his rifle poised ready over his forearm. He was\n      watching the road along which we travelled.\n\n      “What is this, Perkins?” asked Dr. Mortimer.\n\n      Our driver half turned in his seat. “There’s a convict escaped\n      from Princetown, sir. He’s been out three days now, and the\n      warders watch every road and every station, but they’ve had no\n      sight of him yet. The farmers about here don’t like it, sir, and\n      that’s a fact.”\n\n      “Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give\n      information.”\n\n      “Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing\n      compared to the chance of having your throat cut. You see, it\n      isn’t like any ordinary convict. This is a man that would stick\n      at nothing.”\n\n      “Who is he, then?”\n\n      “It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.”\n\n      I remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had\n      taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the\n      crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions\n      of the assassin. The commutation of his death sentence had been\n      due to some doubts as to his complete sanity, so atrocious was\n      his conduct. Our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us\n      rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled with gnarled and\n      craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind swept down from it and set us\n      shivering. Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurking\n      this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his\n      heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast\n      him out. It needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness\n      of the barren waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky.\n      Even Baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely\n      around him.\n\n      We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We looked\n      back on it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the\n      streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new\n      turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands. The\n      road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and\n      olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders. Now and then we\n      passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone, with no\n      creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into\n      a cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which\n      had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. Two\n      high, narrow towers rose over the trees. The driver pointed with\n      his whip.\n\n      “Baskerville Hall,” said he.\n\n      Its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and\n      shining eyes. A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates,\n      a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron, with weather-bitten\n      pillars on either side, blotched with lichens, and surmounted by\n      the boars’ heads of the Baskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of\n      black granite and bared ribs of rafters, but facing it was a new\n      building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles’s\n      South African gold.\n\n      Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels\n      were again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their\n      branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shuddered\n      as he looked up the long, dark drive to where the house glimmered\n      like a ghost at the farther end.\n\n      “Was it here?” he asked in a low voice.\n\n      “No, no, the yew alley is on the other side.”\n\n      The young heir glanced round with a gloomy face.\n\n      “It’s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in\n      such a place as this,” said he. “It’s enough to scare any man.\n      I’ll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months,\n      and you won’t know it again, with a thousand candle-power Swan\n      and Edison right here in front of the hall door.”\n\n      The avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay\n      before us. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a\n      heavy block of building from which a porch projected. The whole\n      front was draped in ivy, with a patch clipped bare here and there\n      where a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil.\n      From this central block rose the twin towers, ancient,\n      crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes. To right and left of\n      the turrets were more modern wings of black granite. A dull light\n      shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high chimneys\n      which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a single\n      black column of smoke.\n\n      “Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!”\n\n      A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the\n      door of the wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted\n      against the yellow light of the hall. She came out and helped the\n      man to hand down our bags.\n\n      “You don’t mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?” said Dr.\n      Mortimer. “My wife is expecting me.”\n\n      “Surely you will stay and have some dinner?”\n\n      “No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I\n      would stay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a\n      better guide than I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to\n      send for me if I can be of service.”\n\n      The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned\n      into the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a\n      fine apartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and\n      heavily raftered with huge baulks of age-blackened oak. In the\n      great old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a\n      log-fire crackled and snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our hands\n      to it, for we were numb from our long drive. Then we gazed round\n      us at the high, thin window of old stained glass, the oak\n      panelling, the stags’ heads, the coats of arms upon the walls,\n      all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp.\n\n      “It’s just as I imagined it,” said Sir Henry. “Is it not the very\n      picture of an old family home? To think that this should be the\n      same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived.\n      It strikes me solemn to think of it.”\n\n      I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed\n      about him. The light beat upon him where he stood, but long\n      shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above\n      him. Barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms.\n      He stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a\n      well-trained servant. He was a remarkable-looking man, tall,\n      handsome, with a square black beard and pale, distinguished\n      features.\n\n      “Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?”\n\n      “Is it ready?”\n\n      “In a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your\n      rooms. My wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you\n      until you have made your fresh arrangements, but you will\n      understand that under the new conditions this house will require\n      a considerable staff.”\n\n      “What new conditions?”\n\n      “I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and\n      we were able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish\n      to have more company, and so you will need changes in your\n      household.”\n\n      “Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?”\n\n      “Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.”\n\n      “But your family have been with us for several generations, have\n      they not? I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an\n      old family connection.”\n\n      I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler’s white\n      face.\n\n      “I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But to tell the\n      truth, sir, we were both very much attached to Sir Charles, and\n      his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very\n      painful to us. I fear that we shall never again be easy in our\n      minds at Baskerville Hall.”\n\n      “But what do you intend to do?”\n\n      “I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing\n      ourselves in some business. Sir Charles’s generosity has given us\n      the means to do so. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to\n      your rooms.”\n\n      A square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall,\n      approached by a double stair. From this central point two long\n      corridors extended the whole length of the building, from which\n      all the bedrooms opened. My own was in the same wing as\n      Baskerville’s and almost next door to it. These rooms appeared to\n      be much more modern than the central part of the house, and the\n      bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the\n      sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind.\n\n      But the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place of\n      shadow and gloom. It was a long chamber with a step separating\n      the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for\n      their dependents. At one end a minstrel’s gallery overlooked it.\n      Black beams shot across above our heads, with a smoke-darkened\n      ceiling beyond them. With rows of flaring torches to light it up,\n      and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time banquet, it might\n      have softened; but now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in\n      the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one’s voice\n      became hushed and one’s spirit subdued. A dim line of ancestors,\n      in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan knight to the\n      buck of the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us by their\n      silent company. We talked little, and I for one was glad when the\n      meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern\n      billiard-room and smoke a cigarette.\n\n      “My word, it isn’t a very cheerful place,” said Sir Henry. “I\n      suppose one can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the\n      picture at present. I don’t wonder that my uncle got a little\n      jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this. However, if\n      it suits you, we will retire early tonight, and perhaps things\n      may seem more cheerful in the morning.”\n\n      I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out from\n      my window. It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of\n      the hall door. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in a\n      rising wind. A half moon broke through the rifts of racing\n      clouds. In its cold light I saw beyond the trees a broken fringe\n      of rocks, and the long, low curve of the melancholy moor. I\n      closed the curtain, feeling that my last impression was in\n      keeping with the rest.\n\n      And yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yet\n      wakeful, tossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the\n      sleep which would not come. Far away a chiming clock struck out\n      the quarters of the hours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay\n      upon the old house. And then suddenly, in the very dead of the\n      night, there came a sound to my ears, clear, resonant, and\n      unmistakable. It was the sob of a woman, the muffled, strangling\n      gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow. I sat up in\n      bed and listened intently. The noise could not have been far away\n      and was certainly in the house. For half an hour I waited with\n      every nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save the\n      chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7.\nThe Stapletons of Merripit House\n\n\n      The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface\n      from our minds the grim and grey impression which had been left\n      upon both of us by our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As\n      Sir Henry and I sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through\n      the high mullioned windows, throwing watery patches of colour\n      from the coats of arms which covered them. The dark panelling\n      glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was hard to realise\n      that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom\n      into our souls upon the evening before.\n\n      “I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to\n      blame!” said the baronet. “We were tired with our journey and\n      chilled by our drive, so we took a grey view of the place. Now we\n      are fresh and well, so it is all cheerful once more.”\n\n      “And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination,” I\n      answered. “Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman\n      I think, sobbing in the night?”\n\n      “That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I\n      heard something of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was\n      no more of it, so I concluded that it was all a dream.”\n\n      “I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob\n      of a woman.”\n\n      “We must ask about this right away.” He rang the bell and asked\n      Barrymore whether he could account for our experience. It seemed\n      to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler\n      still as he listened to his master’s question.\n\n      “There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry,” he answered.\n      “One is the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The\n      other is my wife, and I can answer for it that the sound could\n      not have come from her.”\n\n      And yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after\n      breakfast I met Mrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun\n      full upon her face. She was a large, impassive, heavy-featured\n      woman with a stern set expression of mouth. But her telltale eyes\n      were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids. It was she,\n      then, who wept in the night, and if she did so her husband must\n      know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in\n      declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why did\n      she weep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome,\n      black-bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery\n      and of gloom. It was he who had been the first to discover the\n      body of Sir Charles, and we had only his word for all the\n      circumstances which led up to the old man’s death. Was it\n      possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had seen in\n      the cab in Regent Street? The beard might well have been the\n      same. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such\n      an impression might easily have been erroneous. How could I\n      settle the point forever? Obviously the first thing to do was to\n      see the Grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had\n      really been placed in Barrymore’s own hands. Be the answer what\n      it might, I should at least have something to report to Sherlock\n      Holmes.\n\n      Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that\n      the time was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walk\n      of four miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a\n      small grey hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to\n      be the inn and the house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the\n      rest. The postmaster, who was also the village grocer, had a\n      clear recollection of the telegram.\n\n      “Certainly, sir,” said he, “I had the telegram delivered to Mr.\n      Barrymore exactly as directed.”\n\n      “Who delivered it?”\n\n      “My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore\n      at the Hall last week, did you not?”\n\n      “Yes, father, I delivered it.”\n\n      “Into his own hands?” I asked.\n\n      “Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put\n      it into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore’s hands,\n      and she promised to deliver it at once.”\n\n      “Did you see Mr. Barrymore?”\n\n      “No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.”\n\n      “If you didn’t see him, how do you know he was in the loft?”\n\n      “Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is,” said the\n      postmaster testily. “Didn’t he get the telegram? If there is any\n      mistake it is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain.”\n\n      It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was\n      clear that in spite of Holmes’s ruse we had no proof that\n      Barrymore had not been in London all the time. Suppose that it\n      were so—suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen\n      Sir Charles alive, and the first to dog the new heir when he\n      returned to England. What then? Was he the agent of others or had\n      he some sinister design of his own? What interest could he have\n      in persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought of the strange\n      warning clipped out of the leading article of the _Times_. Was\n      that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was\n      bent upon counteracting his schemes? The only conceivable motive\n      was that which had been suggested by Sir Henry, that if the\n      family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home\n      would be secured for the Barrymores. But surely such an\n      explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the\n      deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible\n      net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that no more\n      complex case had come to him in all the long series of his\n      sensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the\n      grey, lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his\n      preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of\n      responsibility from my shoulders.\n\n      Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running\n      feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned,\n      expecting to see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a\n      stranger who was pursuing me. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven,\n      prim-faced man, flaxen-haired and lean-jawed, between thirty and\n      forty years of age, dressed in a grey suit and wearing a straw\n      hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and\n      he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his hands.\n\n      “You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,” said he\n      as he came panting up to where I stood. “Here on the moor we are\n      homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions. You may\n      possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I\n      am Stapleton, of Merripit House.”\n\n      “Your net and box would have told me as much,” said I, “for I\n      knew that Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know\n      me?”\n\n      “I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me\n      from the window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the\n      same way I thought that I would overtake you and introduce\n      myself. I trust that Sir Henry is none the worse for his\n      journey?”\n\n      “He is very well, thank you.”\n\n      “We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir\n      Charles the new baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking\n      much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of\n      this kind, but I need not tell you that it means a very great\n      deal to the countryside. Sir Henry has, I suppose, no\n      superstitious fears in the matter?”\n\n      “I do not think that it is likely.”\n\n      “Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the\n      family?”\n\n      “I have heard it.”\n\n      “It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here!\n      Any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a\n      creature upon the moor.” He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to\n      read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously. “The\n      story took a great hold upon the imagination of Sir Charles, and\n      I have no doubt that it led to his tragic end.”\n\n      “But how?”\n\n      “His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog\n      might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy\n      that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night\n      in the yew alley. I feared that some disaster might occur, for I\n      was very fond of the old man, and I knew that his heart was\n      weak.”\n\n      “How did you know that?”\n\n      “My friend Mortimer told me.”\n\n      “You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he\n      died of fright in consequence?”\n\n      “Have you any better explanation?”\n\n      “I have not come to any conclusion.”\n\n      “Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”\n\n      The words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the\n      placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no\n      surprise was intended.\n\n      “It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr.\n      Watson,” said he. “The records of your detective have reached us\n      here, and you could not celebrate him without being known\n      yourself. When Mortimer told me your name he could not deny your\n      identity. If you are here, then it follows that Mr. Sherlock\n      Holmes is interesting himself in the matter, and I am naturally\n      curious to know what view he may take.”\n\n      “I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.”\n\n      “May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?”\n\n      “He cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which engage\n      his attention.”\n\n      “What a pity! He might throw some light on that which is so dark\n      to us. But as to your own researches, if there is any possible\n      way in which I can be of service to you I trust that you will\n      command me. If I had any indication of the nature of your\n      suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case, I might\n      perhaps even now give you some aid or advice.”\n\n      “I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend,\n      Sir Henry, and that I need no help of any kind.”\n\n      “Excellent!” said Stapleton. “You are perfectly right to be wary\n      and discreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an\n      unjustifiable intrusion, and I promise you that I will not\n      mention the matter again.”\n\n      We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from\n      the road and wound away across the moor. A steep,\n      boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone\n      days been cut into a granite quarry. The face which was turned\n      towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and brambles growing\n      in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a grey\n      plume of smoke.\n\n      “A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit\n      House,” said he. “Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have\n      the pleasure of introducing you to my sister.”\n\n      My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry’s side. But\n      then I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his\n      study table was littered. It was certain that I could not help\n      with those. And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the\n      neighbours upon the moor. I accepted Stapleton’s invitation, and\n      we turned together down the path.\n\n      “It is a wonderful place, the moor,” said he, looking round over\n      the undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged\n      granite foaming up into fantastic surges. “You never tire of the\n      moor. You cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains.\n      It is so vast, and so barren, and so mysterious.”\n\n      “You know it well, then?”\n\n      “I have only been here two years. The residents would call me a\n      newcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my\n      tastes led me to explore every part of the country round, and I\n      should think that there are few men who know it better than I\n      do.”\n\n      “Is it hard to know?”\n\n      “Very hard. You see, for example, this great plain to the north\n      here with the queer hills breaking out of it. Do you observe\n      anything remarkable about that?”\n\n      “It would be a rare place for a gallop.”\n\n      “You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several\n      their lives before now. You notice those bright green spots\n      scattered thickly over it?”\n\n      “Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest.”\n\n      Stapleton laughed. “That is the great Grimpen Mire,” said he. “A\n      false step yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday I\n      saw one of the moor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I\n      saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole,\n      but it sucked him down at last. Even in dry seasons it is a\n      danger to cross it, but after these autumn rains it is an awful\n      place. And yet I can find my way to the very heart of it and\n      return alive. By George, there is another of those miserable\n      ponies!”\n\n      Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges.\n      Then a long, agonised, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful\n      cry echoed over the moor. It turned me cold with horror, but my\n      companion’s nerves seemed to be stronger than mine.\n\n      “It’s gone!” said he. “The mire has him. Two in two days, and\n      many more, perhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the\n      dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them\n      in its clutches. It’s a bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.”\n\n      “And you say you can penetrate it?”\n\n      “Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can\n      take. I have found them out.”\n\n      “But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?”\n\n      “Well, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut off\n      on all sides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round them\n      in the course of years. That is where the rare plants and the\n      butterflies are, if you have the wit to reach them.”\n\n      “I shall try my luck some day.”\n\n      He looked at me with a surprised face. “For God’s sake put such\n      an idea out of your mind,” said he. “Your blood would be upon my\n      head. I assure you that there would not be the least chance of\n      your coming back alive. It is only by remembering certain complex\n      landmarks that I am able to do it.”\n\n      “Halloa!” I cried. “What is that?”\n\n      A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It\n      filled the whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it\n      came. From a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then\n      sank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur once again.\n      Stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face.\n\n      “Queer place, the moor!” said he.\n\n      “But what is it?”\n\n      “The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for\n      its prey. I’ve heard it once or twice before, but never quite so\n      loud.”\n\n      I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge\n      swelling plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing\n      stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which\n      croaked loudly from a tor behind us.\n\n      “You are an educated man. You don’t believe such nonsense as\n      that?” said I. “What do you think is the cause of so strange a\n      sound?”\n\n      “Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It’s the mud settling, or the\n      water rising, or something.”\n\n      “No, no, that was a living voice.”\n\n      “Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?”\n\n      “No, I never did.”\n\n      “It’s a very rare bird—practically extinct—in England now, but\n      all things are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be\n      surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last\n      of the bitterns.”\n\n      “It’s the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my\n      life.”\n\n      “Yes, it’s rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at the\n      hillside yonder. What do you make of those?”\n\n      The whole steep slope was covered with grey circular rings of\n      stone, a score of them at least.\n\n      “What are they? Sheep-pens?”\n\n      “No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man\n      lived thickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived\n      there since, we find all his little arrangements exactly as he\n      left them. These are his wigwams with the roofs off. You can even\n      see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go\n      inside.\n\n      “But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?”\n\n      “Neolithic man—no date.”\n\n      “What did he do?”\n\n      “He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for\n      tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look\n      at the great trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes,\n      you will find some very singular points about the moor, Dr.\n      Watson. Oh, excuse me an instant! It is surely Cyclopides.”\n\n      A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an\n      instant Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed\n      in pursuit of it. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the\n      great mire, and my acquaintance never paused for an instant,\n      bounding from tuft to tuft behind it, his green net waving in the\n      air. His grey clothes and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress made\n      him not unlike some huge moth himself. I was standing watching\n      his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary\n      activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the\n      treacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps and, turning\n      round, found a woman near me upon the path. She had come from the\n      direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of\n      Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was\n      quite close.\n\n      I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had\n      been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor,\n      and I remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a\n      beauty. The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a\n      most uncommon type. There could not have been a greater contrast\n      between brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted,\n      with light hair and grey eyes, while she was darker than any\n      brunette whom I have seen in England—slim, elegant, and tall. She\n      had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it might have\n      seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the\n      beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegant\n      dress she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely\n      moorland path. Her eyes were on her brother as I turned, and then\n      she quickened her pace towards me. I had raised my hat and was\n      about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned\n      all my thoughts into a new channel.\n\n      “Go back!” she said. “Go straight back to London, instantly.”\n\n      I could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at\n      me, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.\n\n      “Why should I go back?” I asked.\n\n      “I cannot explain.” She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a\n      curious lisp in her utterance. “But for God’s sake do what I ask\n      you. Go back and never set foot upon the moor again.”\n\n      “But I have only just come.”\n\n      “Man, man!” she cried. “Can you not tell when a warning is for\n      your own good? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away from\n      this place at all costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word\n      of what I have said. Would you mind getting that orchid for me\n      among the mare’s-tails yonder? We are very rich in orchids on the\n      moor, though, of course, you are rather late to see the beauties\n      of the place.”\n\n      Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing\n      hard and flushed with his exertions.\n\n      “Halloa, Beryl!” said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of\n      his greeting was not altogether a cordial one.\n\n      “Well, Jack, you are very hot.”\n\n      “Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom\n      found in the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed\n      him!” He spoke unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced\n      incessantly from the girl to me.\n\n      “You have introduced yourselves, I can see.”\n\n      “Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to\n      see the true beauties of the moor.”\n\n      “Why, who do you think this is?”\n\n      “I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.”\n\n      “No, no,” said I. “Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My\n      name is Dr. Watson.”\n\n      A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. “We have\n      been talking at cross purposes,” said she.\n\n      “Why, you had not very much time for talk,” her brother remarked\n      with the same questioning eyes.\n\n      “I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being\n      merely a visitor,” said she. “It cannot much matter to him\n      whether it is early or late for the orchids. But you will come\n      on, will you not, and see Merripit House?”\n\n      A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the\n      farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into\n      repair and turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded\n      it, but the trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and\n      nipped, and the effect of the whole place was mean and\n      melancholy. We were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated\n      old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the house. Inside,\n      however, there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in\n      which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I looked\n      from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor\n      rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel\n      at what could have brought this highly educated man and this\n      beautiful woman to live in such a place.\n\n      “Queer spot to choose, is it not?” said he as if in answer to my\n      thought. “And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we\n      not, Beryl?”\n\n      “Quite happy,” said she, but there was no ring of conviction in\n      her words.\n\n      “I had a school,” said Stapleton. “It was in the north country.\n      The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and\n      uninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helping\n      to mould those young minds, and of impressing them with one’s own\n      character and ideals was very dear to me. However, the fates were\n      against us. A serious epidemic broke out in the school and three\n      of the boys died. It never recovered from the blow, and much of\n      my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet, if it were\n      not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys, I\n      could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes\n      for botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here,\n      and my sister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr.\n      Watson, has been brought upon your head by your expression as you\n      surveyed the moor out of our window.”\n\n      “It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little\n      dull—less for you, perhaps, than for your sister.”\n\n      “No, no, I am never dull,” said she quickly.\n\n      “We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting\n      neighbours. Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line.\n      Poor Sir Charles was also an admirable companion. We knew him\n      well and miss him more than I can tell. Do you think that I\n      should intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make the\n      acquaintance of Sir Henry?”\n\n      “I am sure that he would be delighted.”\n\n      “Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may\n      in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him\n      until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you\n      come upstairs, Dr. Watson, and inspect my collection of\n      Lepidoptera? I think it is the most complete one in the\n      south-west of England. By the time that you have looked through\n      them lunch will be almost ready.”\n\n      But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the\n      moor, the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which\n      had been associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all\n      these things tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of\n      these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite\n      and distinct warning of Miss Stapleton, delivered with such\n      intense earnestness that I could not doubt that some grave and\n      deep reason lay behind it. I resisted all pressure to stay for\n      lunch, and I set off at once upon my return journey, taking the\n      grass-grown path by which we had come.\n\n      It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for\n      those who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was\n      astounded to see Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side\n      of the track. Her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions\n      and she held her hand to her side.\n\n      “I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,”\n      said she. “I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop,\n      or my brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am\n      about the stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir\n      Henry. Please forget the words I said, which have no application\n      whatever to you.”\n\n      “But I can’t forget them, Miss Stapleton,” said I. “I am Sir\n      Henry’s friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine.\n      Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should\n      return to London.”\n\n      “A woman’s whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will\n      understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or\n      do.”\n\n      “No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look\n      in your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton,\n      for ever since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows\n      all round me. Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with\n      little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with\n      no guide to point the track. Tell me then what it was that you\n      meant, and I will promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry.”\n\n      An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her\n      face, but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.\n\n      “You make too much of it, Dr. Watson,” said she. “My brother and\n      I were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him\n      very intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our\n      house. He was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the\n      family, and when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there\n      must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed. I was\n      distressed therefore when another member of the family came down\n      to live here, and I felt that he should be warned of the danger\n      which he will run. That was all which I intended to convey.\n\n      “But what is the danger?”\n\n      “You know the story of the hound?”\n\n      “I do not believe in such nonsense.”\n\n      “But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him\n      away from a place which has always been fatal to his family. The\n      world is wide. Why should he wish to live at the place of\n      danger?”\n\n      “Because it _is_ the place of danger. That is Sir Henry’s nature.\n      I fear that unless you can give me some more definite information\n      than this it would be impossible to get him to move.”\n\n      “I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything\n      definite.”\n\n      “I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant\n      no more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not\n      wish your brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to\n      which he, or anyone else, could object.”\n\n      “My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he\n      thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He\n      would be very angry if he knew that I have said anything which\n      might induce Sir Henry to go away. But I have done my duty now\n      and I will say no more. I must go back, or he will miss me and\n      suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!” She turned and had\n      disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders, while\n      I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to\n      Baskerville Hall.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8.\nFirst Report of Dr. Watson\n\n\n      From this point onward I will follow the course of events by\n      transcribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie\n      before me on the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they\n      are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the\n      moment more accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these\n      tragic events, can possibly do.\n\n      Baskerville Hall, October 13th.\n\n      MY DEAR HOLMES,\n\n      My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to\n      date as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken corner\n      of the world. The longer one stays here the more does the spirit\n      of the moor sink into one’s soul, its vastness, and also its grim\n      charm. When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all\n      traces of modern England behind you, but, on the other hand, you\n      are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the\n      prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the\n      houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge\n      monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. As you\n      look at their grey stone huts against the scarred hillsides you\n      leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a\n      skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a\n      flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would feel\n      that his presence there was more natural than your own. The\n      strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what\n      must always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian,\n      but I could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried\n      race who were forced to accept that which none other would\n      occupy.\n\n      All this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me\n      and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely\n      practical mind. I can still remember your complete indifference\n      as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round\n      the sun. Let me, therefore, return to the facts concerning Sir\n      Henry Baskerville.\n\n      If you have not had any report within the last few days it is\n      because up to today there was nothing of importance to relate.\n      Then a very surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell\n      you in due course. But, first of all, I must keep you in touch\n      with some of the other factors in the situation.\n\n      One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped\n      convict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that\n      he has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the\n      lonely householders of this district. A fortnight has passed\n      since his flight, during which he has not been seen and nothing\n      has been heard of him. It is surely inconceivable that he could\n      have held out upon the moor during all that time. Of course, so\n      far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all. Any\n      one of these stone huts would give him a hiding-place. But there\n      is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of\n      the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone, and the\n      outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.\n\n      We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could\n      take good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy\n      moments when I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles\n      from any help. There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister,\n      and the brother, the latter not a very strong man. They would be\n      helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this Notting\n      Hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance. Both Sir Henry\n      and I were concerned at their situation, and it was suggested\n      that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there, but\n      Stapleton would not hear of it.\n\n      The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a\n      considerable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be\n      wondered at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an\n      active man like him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful\n      woman. There is something tropical and exotic about her which\n      forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother.\n      Yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires. He has certainly a\n      very marked influence over her, for I have seen her continually\n      glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what\n      she said. I trust that he is kind to her. There is a dry glitter\n      in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes with a\n      positive and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him an\n      interesting study.\n\n      He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the\n      very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the\n      legend of the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It\n      was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which\n      is so dismal that it might have suggested the story. We found a\n      short valley between rugged tors which led to an open, grassy\n      space flecked over with the white cotton grass. In the middle of\n      it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at the upper end\n      until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous\n      beast. In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old\n      tragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more\n      than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the\n      interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. He spoke\n      lightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest.\n      Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that\n      he said less than he might, and that he would not express his\n      whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the\n      baronet. He told us of similar cases, where families had suffered\n      from some evil influence, and he left us with the impression that\n      he shared the popular view upon the matter.\n\n      On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was\n      there that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton.\n      From the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly\n      attracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not\n      mutual. He referred to her again and again on our walk home, and\n      since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen\n      something of the brother and sister. They dine here tonight, and\n      there is some talk of our going to them next week. One would\n      imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and\n      yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest\n      disapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying some\n      attention to his sister. He is much attached to her, no doubt,\n      and would lead a lonely life without her, but it would seem the\n      height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her\n      making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain that he does not\n      wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have several times\n      observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being\n      _tête-à-tête_. By the way, your instructions to me never to allow\n      Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a\n      love affair were to be added to our other difficulties. My\n      popularity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders\n      to the letter.\n\n      The other day—Thursday, to be more exact—Dr. Mortimer lunched\n      with us. He has been excavating a barrow at Long Down and has got\n      a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy. Never was\n      there such a single-minded enthusiast as he! The Stapletons came\n      in afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley\n      at Sir Henry’s request to show us exactly how everything occurred\n      upon that fatal night. It is a long, dismal walk, the yew alley,\n      between two high walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band of\n      grass upon either side. At the far end is an old tumble-down\n      summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where the old\n      gentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate with a\n      latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory of\n      the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred. As the old\n      man stood there he saw something coming across the moor,\n      something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran\n      and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion. There was\n      the long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled. And from what? A\n      sheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and\n      monstrous? Was there a human agency in the matter? Did the pale,\n      watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say? It was all dim\n      and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind\n      it.\n\n      One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.\n      Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south\n      of us. He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and\n      choleric. His passion is for the British law, and he has spent a\n      large fortune in litigation. He fights for the mere pleasure of\n      fighting and is equally ready to take up either side of a\n      question, so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly\n      amusement. Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the\n      parish to make him open it. At others he will with his own hands\n      tear down some other man’s gate and declare that a path has\n      existed there from time immemorial, defying the owner to\n      prosecute him for trespass. He is learned in old manorial and\n      communal rights, and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour\n      of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them, so\n      that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the\n      village street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest\n      exploit. He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands\n      at present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his\n      fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the\n      future. Apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured\n      person, and I only mention him because you were particular that I\n      should send some description of the people who surround us. He is\n      curiously employed at present, for, being an amateur astronomer,\n      he has an excellent telescope, with which he lies upon the roof\n      of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of\n      catching a glimpse of the escaped convict. If he would confine\n      his energies to this all would be well, but there are rumours\n      that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening a grave\n      without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the\n      Neolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to keep our\n      lives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where\n      it is badly needed.\n\n      And now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict,\n      the Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let\n      me end on that which is most important and tell you more about\n      the Barrymores, and especially about the surprising development\n      of last night.\n\n      First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London\n      in order to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have\n      already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that\n      the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the\n      other. I told Sir Henry how the matter stood, and he at once, in\n      his downright fashion, had Barrymore up and asked him whether he\n      had received the telegram himself. Barrymore said that he had.\n\n      “Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?” asked Sir Henry.\n\n      Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.\n\n      “No,” said he, “I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife\n      brought it up to me.”\n\n      “Did you answer it yourself?”\n\n      “No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write\n      it.”\n\n      In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.\n\n      “I could not quite understand the object of your questions this\n      morning, Sir Henry,” said he. “I trust that they do not mean that\n      I have done anything to forfeit your confidence?”\n\n      Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by\n      giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London\n      outfit having now all arrived.\n\n      Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid\n      person, very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be\n      puritanical. You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject.\n      Yet I have told you how, on the first night here, I heard her\n      sobbing bitterly, and since then I have more than once observed\n      traces of tears upon her face. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her\n      heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts\n      her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a domestic\n      tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular and\n      questionable in this man’s character, but the adventure of last\n      night brings all my suspicions to a head.\n\n      And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that\n      I am not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in\n      this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night,\n      about two in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step\n      passing my room. I rose, opened my door, and peeped out. A long\n      black shadow was trailing down the corridor. It was thrown by a\n      man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his\n      hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet.\n      I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that it\n      was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly, and there\n      was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole\n      appearance.\n\n      I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which\n      runs round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther\n      side. I waited until he had passed out of sight and then I\n      followed him. When I came round the balcony he had reached the\n      end of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer of\n      light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms.\n      Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his\n      expedition became more mysterious than ever. The light shone\n      steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down the\n      passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of\n      the door.\n\n      Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held\n      against the glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and\n      his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out\n      into the blackness of the moor. For some minutes he stood\n      watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan and with an\n      impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my way\n      back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing\n      once more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had\n      fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock,\n      but I could not tell whence the sound came. What it all means I\n      cannot guess, but there is some secret business going on in this\n      house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom\n      of. I do not trouble you with my theories, for you asked me to\n      furnish you only with facts. I have had a long talk with Sir\n      Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded\n      upon my observations of last night. I will not speak about it\n      just now, but it should make my next report interesting reading.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9.\nThe Light upon the Moor [Second Report of Dr. Watson]\n\n\n      Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th.\n\n      MY DEAR HOLMES,\n\n      If I was compelled to leave you without much news during the\n      early days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am making up\n      for lost time, and that events are now crowding thick and fast\n      upon us. In my last report I ended upon my top note with\n      Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already\n      which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you.\n      Things have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. In\n      some ways they have within the last forty-eight hours become much\n      clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated. But I\n      will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself.\n\n      Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went\n      down the corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had\n      been on the night before. The western window through which he had\n      stared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity above all\n      other windows in the house—it commands the nearest outlook on to\n      the moor. There is an opening between two trees which enables one\n      from this point of view to look right down upon it, while from\n      all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be\n      obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only this\n      window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for\n      something or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so\n      that I can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone.\n      It had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was\n      on foot. That would have accounted for his stealthy movements and\n      also for the uneasiness of his wife. The man is a\n      striking-looking fellow, very well equipped to steal the heart of\n      a country girl, so that this theory seemed to have something to\n      support it. That opening of the door which I had heard after I\n      had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep\n      some clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the\n      morning, and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however\n      much the result may have shown that they were unfounded.\n\n      But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore’s movements might\n      be, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself\n      until I could explain them was more than I could bear. I had an\n      interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast, and I\n      told him all that I had seen. He was less surprised than I had\n      expected.\n\n      “I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to\n      speak to him about it,” said he. “Two or three times I have heard\n      his steps in the passage, coming and going, just about the hour\n      you name.”\n\n      “Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular\n      window,” I suggested.\n\n      “Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see\n      what it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes\n      would do if he were here.”\n\n      “I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,” said\n      I. “He would follow Barrymore and see what he did.”\n\n      “Then we shall do it together.”\n\n      “But surely he would hear us.”\n\n      “The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance\n      of that. We’ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he\n      passes.” Sir Henry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was\n      evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat\n      quiet life upon the moor.\n\n      The baronet has been in communication with the architect who\n      prepared the plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from\n      London, so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon.\n      There have been decorators and furnishers up from Plymouth, and\n      it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare\n      no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family. When\n      the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will need\n      will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves there are\n      pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is\n      willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a\n      woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton.\n      And yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as\n      one would under the circumstances expect. Today, for example, its\n      surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused\n      our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance.\n\n      After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir\n      Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of\n      course I did the same.\n\n      “What, are _you_ coming, Watson?” he asked, looking at me in a\n      curious way.\n\n      “That depends on whether you are going on the moor,” said I.\n\n      “Yes, I am.”\n\n      “Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude,\n      but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not\n      leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the\n      moor.”\n\n      Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.\n\n      “My dear fellow,” said he, “Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not\n      foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the\n      moor. You understand me? I am sure that you are the last man in\n      the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out\n      alone.”\n\n      It put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say\n      or what to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his\n      cane and was gone.\n\n      But when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached\n      me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my\n      sight. I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to\n      you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my\n      disregard for your instructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed\n      at the very thought. It might not even now be too late to\n      overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of Merripit\n      House.\n\n      I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing\n      anything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor\n      path branches off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the\n      wrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from which I could\n      command a view—the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry.\n      Thence I saw him at once. He was on the moor path about a quarter\n      of a mile off, and a lady was by his side who could only be Miss\n      Stapleton. It was clear that there was already an understanding\n      between them and that they had met by appointment. They were\n      walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making\n      quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest\n      in what she was saying, while he listened intently, and once or\n      twice shook his head in strong dissent. I stood among the rocks\n      watching them, very much puzzled as to what I should do next. To\n      follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to\n      be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to\n      let him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a friend was a\n      hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to observe\n      him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to\n      him afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden\n      danger had threatened him I was too far away to be of use, and\n      yet I am sure that you will agree with me that the position was\n      very difficult, and that there was nothing more which I could do.\n\n      Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and\n      were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was\n      suddenly aware that I was not the only witness of their\n      interview. A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, and\n      another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man\n      who was moving among the broken ground. It was Stapleton with his\n      butterfly-net. He was very much closer to the pair than I was,\n      and he appeared to be moving in their direction. At this instant\n      Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His arm was\n      round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from\n      him with her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and she\n      raised one hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring\n      apart and turn hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of the\n      interruption. He was running wildly towards them, his absurd net\n      dangling behind him. He gesticulated and almost danced with\n      excitement in front of the lovers. What the scene meant I could\n      not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir\n      Henry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as the\n      other refused to accept them. The lady stood by in haughty\n      silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a\n      peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at\n      Sir Henry, walked off by the side of her brother. The\n      naturalist’s angry gestures showed that the lady was included in\n      his displeasure. The baronet stood for a minute looking after\n      them, and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come,\n      his head hanging, the very picture of dejection.\n\n      What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed\n      to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend’s\n      knowledge. I ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at\n      the bottom. His face was flushed with anger and his brows were\n      wrinkled, like one who is at his wit’s ends what to do.\n\n      “Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from?” said he. “You\n      don’t mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?”\n\n      I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to\n      remain behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed\n      all that had occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but\n      my frankness disarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a\n      rather rueful laugh.\n\n      “You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe\n      place for a man to be private,” said he, “but, by thunder, the\n      whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my\n      wooing—and a mighty poor wooing at that! Where had you engaged a\n      seat?”\n\n      “I was on that hill.”\n\n      “Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to the\n      front. Did you see him come out on us?”\n\n      “Yes, I did.”\n\n      “Did he ever strike you as being crazy—this brother of hers?”\n\n      “I can’t say that he ever did.”\n\n      “I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today,\n      but you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a\n      straitjacket. What’s the matter with me, anyhow? You’ve lived\n      near me for some weeks, Watson. Tell me straight, now! Is there\n      anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a\n      woman that I loved?”\n\n      “I should say not.”\n\n      “He can’t object to my worldly position, so it must be myself\n      that he has this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt\n      man or woman in my life that I know of. And yet he would not so\n      much as let me touch the tips of her fingers.”\n\n      “Did he say so?”\n\n      “That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I’ve only known her\n      these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made\n      for me, and she, too—she was happy when she was with me, and that\n      I’ll swear. There’s a light in a woman’s eyes that speaks louder\n      than words. But he has never let us get together and it was only\n      today for the first time that I saw a chance of having a few\n      words with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when she did\n      it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn’t have\n      let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it. She\n      kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that\n      she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that\n      since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if\n      she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her\n      to arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as many words to\n      marry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother of\n      hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. He was just\n      white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with\n      fury. What was I doing with the lady? How dared I offer her\n      attentions which were distasteful to her? Did I think that\n      because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he had not\n      been her brother I should have known better how to answer him. As\n      it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such\n      as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour\n      me by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better,\n      so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more\n      hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing\n      by. So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here\n      am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just tell me\n      what it all means, Watson, and I’ll owe you more than ever I can\n      hope to pay.”\n\n      I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely\n      puzzled myself. Our friend’s title, his fortune, his age, his\n      character, and his appearance are all in his favour, and I know\n      nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his\n      family. That his advances should be rejected so brusquely without\n      any reference to the lady’s own wishes and that the lady should\n      accept the situation without protest is very amazing. However,\n      our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from Stapleton\n      himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies for\n      his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview\n      with Sir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was\n      that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at\n      Merripit House next Friday as a sign of it.\n\n      “I don’t say now that he isn’t a crazy man,” said Sir Henry; “I\n      can’t forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning,\n      but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology\n      than he has done.”\n\n      “Did he give any explanation of his conduct?”\n\n      “His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural\n      enough, and I am glad that he should understand her value. They\n      have always been together, and according to his account he has\n      been a very lonely man with only her as a companion, so that the\n      thought of losing her was really terrible to him. He had not\n      understood, he said, that I was becoming attached to her, but\n      when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so, and that she\n      might be taken away from him, it gave him such a shock that for a\n      time he was not responsible for what he said or did. He was very\n      sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish and\n      how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a\n      beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If\n      she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like\n      myself than to anyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him\n      and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself\n      to meet it. He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I\n      would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be\n      content with cultivating the lady’s friendship during that time\n      without claiming her love. This I promised, and so the matter\n      rests.”\n\n      So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is\n      something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we\n      are floundering. We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour\n      upon his sister’s suitor—even when that suitor was so eligible a\n      one as Sir Henry. And now I pass on to another thread which I\n      have extricated out of the tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs\n      in the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs. Barrymore, of the\n      secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window.\n      Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me that I have not\n      disappointed you as an agent—that you do not regret the\n      confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down. All\n      these things have by one night’s work been thoroughly cleared.\n\n      I have said “by one night’s work,” but, in truth, it was by two\n      nights’ work, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up\n      with Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly three o’clock in the\n      morning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming\n      clock upon the stairs. It was a most melancholy vigil and ended\n      by each of us falling asleep in our chairs. Fortunately we were\n      not discouraged, and we determined to try again. The next night\n      we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the\n      least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by,\n      and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient\n      interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into\n      which he hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and we\n      had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an\n      instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary\n      senses keenly on the alert once more. We had heard the creak of a\n      step in the passage.\n\n      Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the\n      distance. Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out\n      in pursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and the\n      corridor was all in darkness. Softly we stole along until we had\n      come into the other wing. We were just in time to catch a glimpse\n      of the tall, black-bearded figure, his shoulders rounded as he\n      tiptoed down the passage. Then he passed through the same door as\n      before, and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and\n      shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor. We\n      shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every plank before we\n      dared to put our whole weight upon it. We had taken the\n      precaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old\n      boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread. Sometimes it seemed\n      impossible that he should fail to hear our approach. However, the\n      man is fortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccupied\n      in that which he was doing. When at last we reached the door and\n      peeped through we found him crouching at the window, candle in\n      hand, his white, intent face pressed against the pane, exactly as\n      I had seen him two nights before.\n\n      We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to\n      whom the most direct way is always the most natural. He walked\n      into the room, and as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the\n      window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood, livid and\n      trembling, before us. His dark eyes, glaring out of the white\n      mask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as he\n      gazed from Sir Henry to me.\n\n      “What are you doing here, Barrymore?”\n\n      “Nothing, sir.” His agitation was so great that he could hardly\n      speak, and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his\n      candle. “It was the window, sir. I go round at night to see that\n      they are fastened.”\n\n      “On the second floor?”\n\n      “Yes, sir, all the windows.”\n\n      “Look here, Barrymore,” said Sir Henry sternly, “we have made up\n      our minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you\n      trouble to tell it sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies!\n      What were you doing at that window?”\n\n      The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands\n      together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and\n      misery.\n\n      “I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the window.”\n\n      “And why were you holding a candle to the window?”\n\n      “Don’t ask me, Sir Henry—don’t ask me! I give you my word, sir,\n      that it is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it\n      concerned no one but myself I would not try to keep it from you.”\n\n      A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the\n      trembling hand of the butler.\n\n      “He must have been holding it as a signal,” said I. “Let us see\n      if there is any answer.” I held it as he had done, and stared out\n      into the darkness of the night. Vaguely I could discern the black\n      bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the\n      moon was behind the clouds. And then I gave a cry of exultation,\n      for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the\n      dark veil, and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square\n      framed by the window.\n\n      “There it is!” I cried.\n\n      “No, no, sir, it is nothing—nothing at all!” the butler broke in;\n      “I assure you, sir—”\n\n      “Move your light across the window, Watson!” cried the baronet.\n      “See, the other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you deny that it\n      is a signal? Come, speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder,\n      and what is this conspiracy that is going on?”\n\n      The man’s face became openly defiant. “It is my business, and not\n      yours. I will not tell.”\n\n      “Then you leave my employment right away.”\n\n      “Very good, sir. If I must I must.”\n\n      “And you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may well be ashamed of\n      yourself. Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred\n      years under this roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot\n      against me.”\n\n      “No, no, sir; no, not against you!” It was a woman’s voice, and\n      Mrs. Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband,\n      was standing at the door. Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt\n      might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling\n      upon her face.\n\n      “We have to go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You can pack our\n      things,” said the butler.\n\n      “Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this? It is my doing, Sir\n      Henry—all mine. He has done nothing except for my sake and\n      because I asked him.”\n\n      “Speak out, then! What does it mean?”\n\n      “My unhappy brother is starving on the moor. We cannot let him\n      perish at our very gates. The light is a signal to him that food\n      is ready for him, and his light out yonder is to show the spot to\n      which to bring it.”\n\n      “Then your brother is—”\n\n      “The escaped convict, sir—Selden, the criminal.”\n\n      “That’s the truth, sir,” said Barrymore. “I said that it was not\n      my secret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have\n      heard it, and you will see that if there was a plot it was not\n      against you.”\n\n      This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at\n      night and the light at the window. Sir Henry and I both stared at\n      the woman in amazement. Was it possible that this stolidly\n      respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most\n      notorious criminals in the country?\n\n      “Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother. We\n      humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way\n      in everything until he came to think that the world was made for\n      his pleasure, and that he could do what he liked in it. Then as\n      he grew older he met wicked companions, and the devil entered\n      into him until he broke my mother’s heart and dragged our name in\n      the dirt. From crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is\n      only the mercy of God which has snatched him from the scaffold;\n      but to me, sir, he was always the little curly-headed boy that I\n      had nursed and played with as an elder sister would. That was why\n      he broke prison, sir. He knew that I was here and that we could\n      not refuse to help him. When he dragged himself here one night,\n      weary and starving, with the warders hard at his heels, what\n      could we do? We took him in and fed him and cared for him. Then\n      you returned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer on\n      the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he\n      lay in hiding there. But every second night we made sure if he\n      was still there by putting a light in the window, and if there\n      was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him.\n      Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long as he was there\n      we could not desert him. That is the whole truth, as I am an\n      honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in\n      the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me, for whose\n      sake he has done all that he has.”\n\n      The woman’s words came with an intense earnestness which carried\n      conviction with them.\n\n      “Is this true, Barrymore?”\n\n      “Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.”\n\n      “Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forget\n      what I have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk\n      further about this matter in the morning.”\n\n      When they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henry\n      had flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our\n      faces. Far away in the black distance there still glowed that one\n      tiny point of yellow light.\n\n      “I wonder he dares,” said Sir Henry.\n\n      “It may be so placed as to be only visible from here.”\n\n      “Very likely. How far do you think it is?”\n\n      “Out by the Cleft Tor, I think.”\n\n      “Not more than a mile or two off.”\n\n      “Hardly that.”\n\n      “Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to\n      it. And he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. By\n      thunder, Watson, I am going out to take that man!”\n\n      The same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the\n      Barrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had\n      been forced from them. The man was a danger to the community, an\n      unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse.\n      We were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him\n      back where he could do no harm. With his brutal and violent\n      nature, others would have to pay the price if we held our hands.\n      Any night, for example, our neighbours the Stapletons might be\n      attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of this which\n      made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.\n\n      “I will come,” said I.\n\n      “Then get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner we\n      start the better, as the fellow may put out his light and be\n      off.”\n\n      In five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our\n      expedition. We hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull\n      moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves.\n      The night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay. Now and\n      again the moon peeped out for an instant, but clouds were driving\n      over the face of the sky, and just as we came out on the moor a\n      thin rain began to fall. The light still burned steadily in\n      front.\n\n      “Are you armed?” I asked.\n\n      “I have a hunting-crop.”\n\n      “We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a\n      desperate fellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him at\n      our mercy before he can resist.”\n\n      “I say, Watson,” said the baronet, “what would Holmes say to\n      this? How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil\n      is exalted?”\n\n      As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast\n      gloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon\n      the borders of the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the wind\n      through the silence of the night, a long, deep mutter, then a\n      rising howl, and then the sad moan in which it died away. Again\n      and again it sounded, the whole air throbbing with it, strident,\n      wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my sleeve and his face\n      glimmered white through the darkness.\n\n      “My God, what’s that, Watson?”\n\n      “I don’t know. It’s a sound they have on the moor. I heard it\n      once before.”\n\n      It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood\n      straining our ears, but nothing came.\n\n      “Watson,” said the baronet, “it was the cry of a hound.”\n\n      My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice\n      which told of the sudden horror which had seized him.\n\n      “What do they call this sound?” he asked.\n\n      “Who?”\n\n      “The folk on the countryside.”\n\n      “Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they call\n      it?”\n\n      “Tell me, Watson. What do they say of it?”\n\n      I hesitated but could not escape the question.\n\n      “They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles.”\n\n      He groaned and was silent for a few moments.\n\n      “A hound it was,” he said at last, “but it seemed to come from\n      miles away, over yonder, I think.”\n\n      “It was hard to say whence it came.”\n\n      “It rose and fell with the wind. Isn’t that the direction of the\n      great Grimpen Mire?”\n\n      “Yes, it is.”\n\n      “Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn’t you think\n      yourself that it was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. You\n      need not fear to speak the truth.”\n\n      “Stapleton was with me when I heard it last. He said that it\n      might be the calling of a strange bird.”\n\n      “No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth in all\n      these stories? Is it possible that I am really in danger from so\n      dark a cause? You don’t believe it, do you, Watson?”\n\n      “No, no.”\n\n      “And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it is\n      another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear\n      such a cry as that. And my uncle! There was the footprint of the\n      hound beside him as he lay. It all fits together. I don’t think\n      that I am a coward, Watson, but that sound seemed to freeze my\n      very blood. Feel my hand!”\n\n      It was as cold as a block of marble.\n\n      “You’ll be all right tomorrow.”\n\n      “I don’t think I’ll get that cry out of my head. What do you\n      advise that we do now?”\n\n      “Shall we turn back?”\n\n      “No, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do\n      it. We after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not,\n      after us. Come on! We’ll see it through if all the fiends of the\n      pit were loose upon the moor.”\n\n      We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of\n      the craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning\n      steadily in front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance\n      of a light upon a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer\n      seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might\n      have been within a few yards of us. But at last we could see\n      whence it came, and then we knew that we were indeed very close.\n      A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which\n      flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also\n      to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of\n      Baskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach,\n      and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. It\n      was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle\n      of the moor, with no sign of life near it—just the one straight\n      yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it.\n\n      “What shall we do now?” whispered Sir Henry.\n\n      “Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a\n      glimpse of him.”\n\n      The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. Over\n      the rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was\n      thrust out an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all\n      seamed and scored with vile passions. Foul with mire, with a\n      bristling beard, and hung with matted hair, it might well have\n      belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on\n      the hillsides. The light beneath him was reflected in his small,\n      cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the\n      darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps\n      of the hunters.\n\n      Something had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have been\n      that Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to\n      give, or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking\n      that all was not well, but I could read his fears upon his wicked\n      face. Any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the\n      darkness. I sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the same.\n      At the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and\n      hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had\n      sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his short, squat, strongly\n      built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run. At the\n      same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds.\n      We rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man\n      running with great speed down the other side, springing over the\n      stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat. A lucky\n      long shot of my revolver might have crippled him, but I had\n      brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an\n      unarmed man who was running away.\n\n      We were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but we\n      soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him. We saw him\n      for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck\n      moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant\n      hill. We ran and ran until we were completely blown, but the\n      space between us grew ever wider. Finally we stopped and sat\n      panting on two rocks, while we watched him disappearing in the\n      distance.\n\n      And it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and\n      unexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning to\n      go home, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low\n      upon the right, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up\n      against the lower curve of its silver disc. There, outlined as\n      black as an ebony statue on that shining background, I saw the\n      figure of a man upon the tor. Do not think that it was a\n      delusion, Holmes. I assure you that I have never in my life seen\n      anything more clearly. As far as I could judge, the figure was\n      that of a tall, thin man. He stood with his legs a little\n      separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were\n      brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which\n      lay before him. He might have been the very spirit of that\n      terrible place. It was not the convict. This man was far from the\n      place where the latter had disappeared. Besides, he was a much\n      taller man. With a cry of surprise I pointed him out to the\n      baronet, but in the instant during which I had turned to grasp\n      his arm the man was gone. There was the sharp pinnacle of granite\n      still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but its peak bore no\n      trace of that silent and motionless figure.\n\n      I wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it\n      was some distance away. The baronet’s nerves were still quivering\n      from that cry, which recalled the dark story of his family, and\n      he was not in the mood for fresh adventures. He had not seen this\n      lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his\n      strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me. “A\n      warder, no doubt,” said he. “The moor has been thick with them\n      since this fellow escaped.” Well, perhaps his explanation may be\n      the right one, but I should like to have some further proof of\n      it. Today we mean to communicate to the Princetown people where\n      they should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines that\n      we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our\n      own prisoner. Such are the adventures of last night, and you must\n      acknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well in\n      the matter of a report. Much of what I tell you is no doubt quite\n      irrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should let\n      you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those\n      which will be of most service to you in helping you to your\n      conclusions. We are certainly making some progress. So far as the\n      Barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions, and that\n      has cleared up the situation very much. But the moor with its\n      mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as\n      ever. Perhaps in my next I may be able to throw some light upon\n      this also. Best of all would it be if you could come down to us.\n      In any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next\n      few days.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10.\nExtract from the Diary of Dr. Watson\n\n\n      So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have\n      forwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now,\n      however, I have arrived at a point in my narrative where I am\n      compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my\n      recollections, aided by the diary which I kept at the time. A few\n      extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which\n      are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I proceed,\n      then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the\n      convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.\n\n      _October_ 16_th_.—A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain.\n      The house is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and\n      then to show the dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver\n      veins upon the sides of the hills, and the distant boulders\n      gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces. It is\n      melancholy outside and in. The baronet is in a black reaction\n      after the excitements of the night. I am conscious myself of a\n      weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger—ever present\n      danger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define\n      it.\n\n      And have I not cause for such a feeling? Consider the long\n      sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister\n      influence which is at work around us. There is the death of the\n      last occupant of the Hall, fulfilling so exactly the conditions\n      of the family legend, and there are the repeated reports from\n      peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor.\n      Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the\n      distant baying of a hound. It is incredible, impossible, that it\n      should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature. A spectral\n      hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its\n      howling is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may fall in\n      with such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one\n      quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade\n      me to believe in such a thing. To do so would be to descend to\n      the level of these poor peasants, who are not content with a mere\n      fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell-fire shooting\n      from his mouth and eyes. Holmes would not listen to such fancies,\n      and I am his agent. But facts are facts, and I have twice heard\n      this crying upon the moor. Suppose that there were really some\n      huge hound loose upon it; that would go far to explain\n      everything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where did\n      it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one\n      saw it by day? It must be confessed that the natural explanation\n      offers almost as many difficulties as the other. And always,\n      apart from the hound, there is the fact of the human agency in\n      London, the man in the cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry\n      against the moor. This at least was real, but it might have been\n      the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy. Where\n      is that friend or enemy now? Has he remained in London, or has he\n      followed us down here? Could he—could he be the stranger whom I\n      saw upon the tor?\n\n      It is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet\n      there are some things to which I am ready to swear. He is no one\n      whom I have seen down here, and I have now met all the\n      neighbours. The figure was far taller than that of Stapleton, far\n      thinner than that of Frankland. Barrymore it might possibly have\n      been, but we had left him behind us, and I am certain that he\n      could not have followed us. A stranger then is still dogging us,\n      just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have never shaken him\n      off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we might\n      find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one\n      purpose I must now devote all my energies.\n\n      My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second\n      and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as\n      possible to anyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have\n      been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor. I will say\n      nothing to add to his anxieties, but I will take my own steps to\n      attain my own end.\n\n      We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore\n      asked leave to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in\n      his study some little time. Sitting in the billiard-room I more\n      than once heard the sound of voices raised, and I had a pretty\n      good idea what the point was which was under discussion. After a\n      time the baronet opened his door and called for me. “Barrymore\n      considers that he has a grievance,” he said. “He thinks that it\n      was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he,\n      of his own free will, had told us the secret.”\n\n      The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.\n\n      “I may have spoken too warmly, sir,” said he, “and if I have, I\n      am sure that I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much\n      surprised when I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning\n      and learned that you had been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has\n      enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track.”\n\n      “If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a\n      different thing,” said the baronet, “you only told us, or rather\n      your wife only told us, when it was forced from you and you could\n      not help yourself.”\n\n      “I didn’t think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir\n      Henry—indeed I didn’t.”\n\n      “The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered\n      over the moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You\n      only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr.\n      Stapleton’s house, for example, with no one but himself to defend\n      it. There’s no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key.”\n\n      “He’ll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon\n      that. But he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I\n      assure you, Sir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary\n      arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to\n      South America. For God’s sake, sir, I beg of you not to let the\n      police know that he is still on the moor. They have given up the\n      chase there, and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for\n      him. You can’t tell on him without getting my wife and me into\n      trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.”\n\n      “What do you say, Watson?”\n\n      I shrugged my shoulders. “If he were safely out of the country it\n      would relieve the tax-payer of a burden.”\n\n      “But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he\n      goes?”\n\n      “He would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him with\n      all that he can want. To commit a crime would be to show where he\n      was hiding.”\n\n      “That is true,” said Sir Henry. “Well, Barrymore—”\n\n      “God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would have\n      killed my poor wife had he been taken again.”\n\n      “I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after\n      what we have heard I don’t feel as if I could give the man up, so\n      there is an end of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.”\n\n      With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he\n      hesitated and then came back.\n\n      “You’ve been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the\n      best I can for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and\n      perhaps I should have said it before, but it was long after the\n      inquest that I found it out. I’ve never breathed a word about it\n      yet to mortal man. It’s about poor Sir Charles’s death.”\n\n      The baronet and I were both upon our feet. “Do you know how he\n      died?”\n\n      “No, sir, I don’t know that.”\n\n      “What then?”\n\n      “I know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a\n      woman.”\n\n      “To meet a woman! He?”\n\n      “Yes, sir.”\n\n      “And the woman’s name?”\n\n      “I can’t give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials.\n      Her initials were L. L.”\n\n      “How do you know this, Barrymore?”\n\n      “Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had\n      usually a great many letters, for he was a public man and well\n      known for his kind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was\n      glad to turn to him. But that morning, as it chanced, there was\n      only this one letter, so I took the more notice of it. It was\n      from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed in a woman’s hand.”\n\n      “Well?”\n\n      “Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have\n      done had it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was\n      cleaning out Sir Charles’s study—it had never been touched since\n      his death—and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back\n      of the grate. The greater part of it was charred to pieces, but\n      one little slip, the end of a page, hung together, and the\n      writing could still be read, though it was grey on a black\n      ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the\n      letter and it said: ‘Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn\n      this letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were\n      signed the initials L. L.”\n\n      “Have you got that slip?”\n\n      “No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.”\n\n      “Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?”\n\n      “Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should\n      not have noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.”\n\n      “And you have no idea who L. L. is?”\n\n      “No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our\n      hands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles’s\n      death.”\n\n      “I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this\n      important information.”\n\n      “Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to\n      us. And then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir\n      Charles, as we well might be considering all that he has done for\n      us. To rake this up couldn’t help our poor master, and it’s well\n      to go carefully when there’s a lady in the case. Even the best of\n      us—”\n\n      “You thought it might injure his reputation?”\n\n      “Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you have\n      been kind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you\n      unfairly not to tell you all that I know about the matter.”\n\n      “Very good, Barrymore; you can go.” When the butler had left us\n      Sir Henry turned to me. “Well, Watson, what do you think of this\n      new light?”\n\n      “It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.”\n\n      “So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up\n      the whole business. We have gained that much. We know that there\n      is someone who has the facts if we can only find her. What do you\n      think we should do?”\n\n      “Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the clue\n      for which he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not\n      bring him down.”\n\n      I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning’s\n      conversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he had been\n      very busy of late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street\n      were few and short, with no comments upon the information which I\n      had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission. No doubt his\n      blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties. And yet this\n      new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his\n      interest. I wish that he were here.\n\n      _October_ 17_th_.—All day today the rain poured down, rustling on\n      the ivy and dripping from the eaves. I thought of the convict out\n      upon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever his\n      crimes, he has suffered something to atone for them. And then I\n      thought of that other one—the face in the cab, the figure against\n      the moon. Was he also out in that deluged—the unseen watcher, the\n      man of darkness? In the evening I put on my waterproof and I\n      walked far upon the sodden moor, full of dark imaginings, the\n      rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears.\n      God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even the\n      firm uplands are becoming a morass. I found the black tor upon\n      which I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit\n      I looked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain squalls\n      drifted across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured\n      clouds hung low over the landscape, trailing in grey wreaths down\n      the sides of the fantastic hills. In the distant hollow on the\n      left, half hidden by the mist, the two thin towers of Baskerville\n      Hall rose above the trees. They were the only signs of human life\n      which I could see, save only those prehistoric huts which lay\n      thickly upon the slopes of the hills. Nowhere was there any trace\n      of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot two nights\n      before.\n\n      As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his\n      dog-cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying\n      farmhouse of Foulmire. He has been very attentive to us, and\n      hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see\n      how we were getting on. He insisted upon my climbing into his\n      dog-cart, and he gave me a lift homeward. I found him much\n      troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel. It had\n      wandered on to the moor and had never come back. I gave him such\n      consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the Grimpen\n      Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.\n\n      “By the way, Mortimer,” said I as we jolted along the rough road,\n      “I suppose there are few people living within driving distance of\n      this whom you do not know?”\n\n      “Hardly any, I think.”\n\n      “Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are\n      L. L.?”\n\n      He thought for a few minutes.\n\n      “No,” said he. “There are a few gipsies and labouring folk for\n      whom I can’t answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no\n      one whose initials are those. Wait a bit though,” he added after\n      a pause. “There is Laura Lyons—her initials are L. L.—but she\n      lives in Coombe Tracey.”\n\n      “Who is she?” I asked.\n\n      “She is Frankland’s daughter.”\n\n      “What! Old Frankland the crank?”\n\n      “Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching\n      on the moor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. The\n      fault from what I hear may not have been entirely on one side.\n      Her father refused to have anything to do with her because she\n      had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other\n      reasons as well. So, between the old sinner and the young one the\n      girl has had a pretty bad time.”\n\n      “How does she live?”\n\n      “I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be\n      more, for his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she\n      may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the\n      bad. Her story got about, and several of the people here did\n      something to enable her to earn an honest living. Stapleton did\n      for one, and Sir Charles for another. I gave a trifle myself. It\n      was to set her up in a typewriting business.”\n\n      He wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to\n      satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much, for there is\n      no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow\n      morning I shall find my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see\n      this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of equivocal reputation, a long step will\n      have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of\n      mysteries. I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent,\n      for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent\n      I asked him casually to what type Frankland’s skull belonged, and\n      so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive. I have\n      not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.\n\n      I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous\n      and melancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just\n      now, which gives me one more strong card which I can play in due\n      time.\n\n      Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played\n      écarté afterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the\n      library, and I took the chance to ask him a few questions.\n\n      “Well,” said I, “has this precious relation of yours departed, or\n      is he still lurking out yonder?”\n\n      “I don’t know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has\n      brought nothing but trouble here! I’ve not heard of him since I\n      left out food for him last, and that was three days ago.”\n\n      “Did you see him then?”\n\n      “No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.”\n\n      “Then he was certainly there?”\n\n      “So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took\n      it.”\n\n      I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at\n      Barrymore.\n\n      “You know that there is another man then?”\n\n      “Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.”\n\n      “Have you seen him?”\n\n      “No, sir.”\n\n      “How do you know of him then?”\n\n      “Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He’s in hiding,\n      too, but he’s not a convict as far as I can make out. I don’t\n      like it, Dr. Watson—I tell you straight, sir, that I don’t like\n      it.” He spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness.\n\n      “Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter\n      but that of your master. I have come here with no object except\n      to help him. Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don’t like.”\n\n      Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst\n      or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words.\n\n      “It’s all these goings-on, sir,” he cried at last, waving his\n      hand towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor.\n      “There’s foul play somewhere, and there’s black villainy brewing,\n      to that I’ll swear! Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry\n      on his way back to London again!”\n\n      “But what is it that alarms you?”\n\n      “Look at Sir Charles’s death! That was bad enough, for all that\n      the coroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night.\n      There’s not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for\n      it. Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and\n      waiting! What’s he waiting for? What does it mean? It means no\n      good to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall\n      be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry’s new servants\n      are ready to take over the Hall.”\n\n      “But about this stranger,” said I. “Can you tell me anything\n      about him? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or\n      what he was doing?”\n\n      “He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing\n      away. At first he thought that he was the police, but soon he\n      found that he had some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he\n      was, as far as he could see, but what he was doing he could not\n      make out.”\n\n      “And where did he say that he lived?”\n\n      “Among the old houses on the hillside—the stone huts where the\n      old folk used to live.”\n\n      “But how about his food?”\n\n      “Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and\n      brings all he needs. I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what\n      he wants.”\n\n      “Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further of this some other\n      time.” When the butler had gone I walked over to the black\n      window, and I looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds\n      and at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees. It is a wild\n      night indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor.\n      What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in\n      such a place at such a time! And what deep and earnest purpose\n      can he have which calls for such a trial! There, in that hut upon\n      the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has\n      vexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have\n      passed before I have done all that man can do to reach the heart\n      of the mystery.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 11.\nThe Man on the Tor\n\n\n      The extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter\n      has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a time\n      when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their\n      terrible conclusion. The incidents of the next few days are\n      indelibly graven upon my recollection, and I can tell them\n      without reference to the notes made at the time. I start them\n      from the day which succeeded that upon which I had established\n      two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura Lyons of\n      Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made an\n      appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his\n      death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be\n      found among the stone huts upon the hillside. With these two\n      facts in my possession I felt that either my intelligence or my\n      courage must be deficient if I could not throw some further light\n      upon these dark places.\n\n      I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about\n      Mrs. Lyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer remained\n      with him at cards until it was very late. At breakfast, however,\n      I informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would\n      care to accompany me to Coombe Tracey. At first he was very eager\n      to come, but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I\n      went alone the results might be better. The more formal we made\n      the visit the less information we might obtain. I left Sir Henry\n      behind, therefore, not without some prickings of conscience, and\n      drove off upon my new quest.\n\n      When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses,\n      and I made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate.\n      I had no difficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and\n      well appointed. A maid showed me in without ceremony, and as I\n      entered the sitting-room a lady, who was sitting before a\n      Remington typewriter, sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome.\n      Her face fell, however, when she saw that I was a stranger, and\n      she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit.\n\n      The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme\n      beauty. Her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and\n      her cheeks, though considerably freckled, were flushed with the\n      exquisite bloom of the brunette, the dainty pink which lurks at\n      the heart of the sulphur rose. Admiration was, I repeat, the\n      first impression. But the second was criticism. There was\n      something subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of\n      expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness of lip\n      which marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are\n      afterthoughts. At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in\n      the presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me\n      the reasons for my visit. I had not quite understood until that\n      instant how delicate my mission was.\n\n      “I have the pleasure,” said I, “of knowing your father.”\n\n      It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it.\n      “There is nothing in common between my father and me,” she said.\n      “I owe him nothing, and his friends are not mine. If it were not\n      for the late Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I\n      might have starved for all that my father cared.”\n\n      “It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come\n      here to see you.”\n\n      The freckles started out on the lady’s face.\n\n      “What can I tell you about him?” she asked, and her fingers\n      played nervously over the stops of her typewriter.\n\n      “You knew him, did you not?”\n\n      “I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. If\n      I am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest\n      which he took in my unhappy situation.”\n\n      “Did you correspond with him?”\n\n      The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes.\n\n      “What is the object of these questions?” she asked sharply.\n\n      “The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I\n      should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our\n      control.”\n\n      She was silent and her face was still very pale. At last she\n      looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner.\n\n      “Well, I’ll answer,” she said. “What are your questions?”\n\n      “Did you correspond with Sir Charles?”\n\n      “I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his\n      delicacy and his generosity.”\n\n      “Have you the dates of those letters?”\n\n      “No.”\n\n      “Have you ever met him?”\n\n      “Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was a\n      very retiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.”\n\n      “But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he\n      know enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say\n      that he has done?”\n\n      She met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.\n\n      “There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united\n      to help me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate\n      friend of Sir Charles’s. He was exceedingly kind, and it was\n      through him that Sir Charles learned about my affairs.”\n\n      I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton\n      his almoner upon several occasions, so the lady’s statement bore\n      the impress of truth upon it.\n\n      “Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?” I\n      continued.\n\n      Mrs. Lyons flushed with anger again. “Really, sir, this is a very\n      extraordinary question.”\n\n      “I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.”\n\n      “Then I answer, certainly not.”\n\n      “Not on the very day of Sir Charles’s death?”\n\n      The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before\n      me. Her dry lips could not speak the “No” which I saw rather than\n      heard.\n\n      “Surely your memory deceives you,” said I. “I could even quote a\n      passage of your letter. It ran ‘Please, please, as you are a\n      gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o’clock.’”\n\n      I thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by a\n      supreme effort.\n\n      “Is there no such thing as a gentleman?” she gasped.\n\n      “You do Sir Charles an injustice. He _did_ burn the letter. But\n      sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned. You\n      acknowledge now that you wrote it?”\n\n      “Yes, I did write it,” she cried, pouring out her soul in a\n      torrent of words. “I did write it. Why should I deny it? I have\n      no reason to be ashamed of it. I wished him to help me. I\n      believed that if I had an interview I could gain his help, so I\n      asked him to meet me.”\n\n      “But why at such an hour?”\n\n      “Because I had only just learned that he was going to London next\n      day and might be away for months. There were reasons why I could\n      not get there earlier.”\n\n      “But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the\n      house?”\n\n      “Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor’s\n      house?”\n\n      “Well, what happened when you did get there?”\n\n      “I never went.”\n\n      “Mrs. Lyons!”\n\n      “No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I never went.\n      Something intervened to prevent my going.”\n\n      “What was that?”\n\n      “That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.”\n\n      “You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir\n      Charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death, but\n      you deny that you kept the appointment.”\n\n      “That is the truth.”\n\n      Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get\n      past that point.\n\n      “Mrs. Lyons,” said I as I rose from this long and inconclusive\n      interview, “you are taking a very great responsibility and\n      putting yourself in a very false position by not making an\n      absolutely clean breast of all that you know. If I have to call\n      in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are\n      compromised. If your position is innocent, why did you in the\n      first instance deny having written to Sir Charles upon that\n      date?”\n\n      “Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from\n      it and that I might find myself involved in a scandal.”\n\n      “And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy\n      your letter?”\n\n      “If you have read the letter you will know.”\n\n      “I did not say that I had read all the letter.”\n\n      “You quoted some of it.”\n\n      “I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned\n      and it was not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that\n      you were so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter\n      which he received on the day of his death.”\n\n      “The matter is a very private one.”\n\n      “The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.”\n\n      “I will tell you, then. If you have heard anything of my unhappy\n      history you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason\n      to regret it.”\n\n      “I have heard so much.”\n\n      “My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I\n      abhor. The law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by the\n      possibility that he may force me to live with him. At the time\n      that I wrote this letter to Sir Charles I had learned that there\n      was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses\n      could be met. It meant everything to me—peace of mind, happiness,\n      self-respect—everything. I knew Sir Charles’s generosity, and I\n      thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help\n      me.”\n\n      “Then how is it that you did not go?”\n\n      “Because I received help in the interval from another source.”\n\n      “Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?”\n\n      “So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next\n      morning.”\n\n      The woman’s story hung coherently together, and all my questions\n      were unable to shake it. I could only check it by finding if she\n      had, indeed, instituted divorce proceedings against her husband\n      at or about the time of the tragedy.\n\n      It was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been\n      to Baskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would be\n      necessary to take her there, and could not have returned to\n      Coombe Tracey until the early hours of the morning. Such an\n      excursion could not be kept secret. The probability was,\n      therefore, that she was telling the truth, or, at least, a part\n      of the truth. I came away baffled and disheartened. Once again I\n      had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every\n      path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission. And yet\n      the more I thought of the lady’s face and of her manner the more\n      I felt that something was being held back from me. Why should she\n      turn so pale? Why should she fight against every admission until\n      it was forced from her? Why should she have been so reticent at\n      the time of the tragedy? Surely the explanation of all this could\n      not be as innocent as she would have me believe. For the moment I\n      could proceed no farther in that direction, but must turn back to\n      that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts\n      upon the moor.\n\n      And that was a most vague direction. I realised it as I drove\n      back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient\n      people. Barrymore’s only indication had been that the stranger\n      lived in one of these abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them\n      are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor. But\n      I had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the man\n      himself standing upon the summit of the Black Tor. That, then,\n      should be the centre of my search. From there I should explore\n      every hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right one. If\n      this man were inside it I should find out from his own lips, at\n      the point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he had\n      dogged us so long. He might slip away from us in the crowd of\n      Regent Street, but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely\n      moor. On the other hand, if I should find the hut and its tenant\n      should not be within it I must remain there, however long the\n      vigil, until he returned. Holmes had missed him in London. It\n      would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run him to earth\n      where my master had failed.\n\n      Luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now\n      at last it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was\n      none other than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, grey-whiskered\n      and red-faced, outside the gate of his garden, which opened on to\n      the highroad along which I travelled.\n\n      “Good-day, Dr. Watson,” cried he with unwonted good humour, “you\n      must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass\n      of wine and to congratulate me.”\n\n      My feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after\n      what I had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was\n      anxious to send Perkins and the wagonette home, and the\n      opportunity was a good one. I alighted and sent a message to Sir\n      Henry that I should walk over in time for dinner. Then I followed\n      Frankland into his dining-room.\n\n      “It is a great day for me, sir—one of the red-letter days of my\n      life,” he cried with many chuckles. “I have brought off a double\n      event. I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law, and\n      that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it. I have\n      established a right of way through the centre of old Middleton’s\n      park, slap across it, sir, within a hundred yards of his own\n      front door. What do you think of that? We’ll teach these magnates\n      that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners,\n      confound them! And I’ve closed the wood where the Fernworthy folk\n      used to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that there\n      are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they\n      like with their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr.\n      Watson, and both in my favour. I haven’t had such a day since I\n      had Sir John Morland for trespass because he shot in his own\n      warren.”\n\n      “How on earth did you do that?”\n\n      “Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading—Frankland\n      _v_. Morland, Court of Queen’s Bench. It cost me £200, but I got\n      my verdict.”\n\n      “Did it do you any good?”\n\n      “None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in the\n      matter. I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have no\n      doubt, for example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in\n      effigy tonight. I told the police last time they did it that they\n      should stop these disgraceful exhibitions. The County\n      Constabulary is in a scandalous state, sir, and it has not\n      afforded me the protection to which I am entitled. The case of\n      Frankland _v_. Regina will bring the matter before the attention\n      of the public. I told them that they would have occasion to\n      regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come\n      true.”\n\n      “How so?” I asked.\n\n      The old man put on a very knowing expression. “Because I could\n      tell them what they are dying to know; but nothing would induce\n      me to help the rascals in any way.”\n\n      I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get\n      away from his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it.\n      I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to\n      understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest\n      way to stop his confidences.\n\n      “Some poaching case, no doubt?” said I with an indifferent\n      manner.\n\n      “Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that!\n      What about the convict on the moor?”\n\n      I stared. “You don’t mean that you know where he is?” said I.\n\n      “I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I\n      could help the police to lay their hands on him. Has it never\n      struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where\n      he got his food and so trace it to him?”\n\n      He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth.\n      “No doubt,” said I; “but how do you know that he is anywhere upon\n      the moor?”\n\n      “I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who\n      takes him his food.”\n\n      My heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in the\n      power of this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took a\n      weight from my mind.\n\n      “You’ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a\n      child. I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. He\n      passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should\n      he be going except to the convict?”\n\n      Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of\n      interest. A child! Barrymore had said that our unknown was\n      supplied by a boy. It was on his track, and not upon the\n      convict’s, that Frankland had stumbled. If I could get his\n      knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But incredulity\n      and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.\n\n      “I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of\n      one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father’s dinner.”\n\n      The least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old\n      autocrat. His eyes looked malignantly at me, and his grey\n      whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat.\n\n      “Indeed, sir!” said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching\n      moor. “Do you see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you see\n      the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it? It is the\n      stoniest part of the whole moor. Is that a place where a shepherd\n      would be likely to take his station? Your suggestion, sir, is a\n      most absurd one.”\n\n      I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the\n      facts. My submission pleased him and led him to further\n      confidences.\n\n      “You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I\n      come to an opinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his\n      bundle. Every day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been\n      able—but wait a moment, Dr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is\n      there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside?”\n\n      It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark\n      dot against the dull green and grey.\n\n      “Come, sir, come!” cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. “You will\n      see with your own eyes and judge for yourself.”\n\n      The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod,\n      stood upon the flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his eye\n      to it and gave a cry of satisfaction.\n\n      “Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!”\n\n      There he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle\n      upon his shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reached\n      the crest I saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant\n      against the cold blue sky. He looked round him with a furtive and\n      stealthy air, as one who dreads pursuit. Then he vanished over\n      the hill.\n\n      “Well! Am I right?”\n\n      “Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.”\n\n      “And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But\n      not one word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy\n      also, Dr. Watson. Not a word! You understand!”\n\n      “Just as you wish.”\n\n      “They have treated me shamefully—shamefully. When the facts come\n      out in Frankland _v_. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of\n      indignation will run through the country. Nothing would induce me\n      to help the police in any way. For all they cared it might have\n      been me, instead of my effigy, which these rascals burned at the\n      stake. Surely you are not going! You will help me to empty the\n      decanter in honour of this great occasion!”\n\n      But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading\n      him from his announced intention of walking home with me. I kept\n      the road as long as his eye was on me, and then I struck off\n      across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy\n      had disappeared. Everything was working in my favour, and I swore\n      that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that\n      I should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way.\n\n      The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the\n      hill, and the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one\n      side and grey shadow on the other. A haze lay low upon the\n      farthest sky-line, out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of\n      Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the wide expanse there was no sound\n      and no movement. One great grey bird, a gull or curlew, soared\n      aloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be the only living\n      things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath\n      it. The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery\n      and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy\n      was nowhere to be seen. But down beneath me in a cleft of the\n      hills there was a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middle\n      of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a\n      screen against the weather. My heart leaped within me as I saw\n      it. This must be the burrow where the stranger lurked. At last my\n      foot was on the threshold of his hiding place—his secret was\n      within my grasp.\n\n      As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do\n      when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I\n      satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a\n      habitation. A vague pathway among the boulders led to the\n      dilapidated opening which served as a door. All was silent\n      within. The unknown might be lurking there, or he might be\n      prowling on the moor. My nerves tingled with the sense of\n      adventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the\n      butt of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked\n      in. The place was empty.\n\n      But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false\n      scent. This was certainly where the man lived. Some blankets\n      rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which\n      Neolithic man had once slumbered. The ashes of a fire were heaped\n      in a rude grate. Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket\n      half-full of water. A litter of empty tins showed that the place\n      had been occupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes became\n      accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and a half-full\n      bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of the\n      hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this\n      stood a small cloth bundle—the same, no doubt, which I had seen\n      through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained\n      a loaf of bread, a tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved\n      peaches. As I set it down again, after having examined it, my\n      heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper\n      with writing upon it. I raised it, and this was what I read,\n      roughly scrawled in pencil: “Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe\n      Tracey.”\n\n      For a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking\n      out the meaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir\n      Henry, who was being dogged by this secret man. He had not\n      followed me himself, but he had set an agent—the boy,\n      perhaps—upon my track, and this was his report. Possibly I had\n      taken no step since I had been upon the moor which had not been\n      observed and reported. Always there was this feeling of an unseen\n      force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and\n      delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme\n      moment that one realised that one was indeed entangled in its\n      meshes.\n\n      If there was one report there might be others, so I looked round\n      the hut in search of them. There was no trace, however, of\n      anything of the kind, nor could I discover any sign which might\n      indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this\n      singular place, save that he must be of Spartan habits and cared\n      little for the comforts of life. When I thought of the heavy\n      rains and looked at the gaping roof I understood how strong and\n      immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that\n      inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by\n      chance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut\n      until I knew.\n\n      Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with\n      scarlet and gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches\n      by the distant pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There\n      were the two towers of Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur\n      of smoke which marked the village of Grimpen. Between the two,\n      behind the hill, was the house of the Stapletons. All was sweet\n      and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light, and yet as I\n      looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of Nature but\n      quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which\n      every instant was bringing nearer. With tingling nerves but a\n      fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited\n      with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.\n\n      And then at last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of a\n      boot striking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming\n      nearer and nearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner and\n      cocked the pistol in my pocket, determined not to discover myself\n      until I had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger.\n      There was a long pause which showed that he had stopped. Then\n      once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the\n      opening of the hut.\n\n      “It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,” said a well-known\n      voice. “I really think that you will be more comfortable outside\n      than in.”\n\n\n\n\nChapter 12.\nDeath on the Moor\n\n\n      For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my\n      ears. Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a\n      crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be\n      lifted from my soul. That cold, incisive, ironical voice could\n      belong to but one man in all the world.\n\n      “Holmes!” I cried—“Holmes!”\n\n      “Come out,” said he, “and please be careful with the revolver.”\n\n      I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone\n      outside, his grey eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon\n      my astonished features. He was thin and worn, but clear and\n      alert, his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the\n      wind. In his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other\n      tourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with that catlike\n      love of personal cleanliness which was one of his\n      characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen\n      as perfect as if he were in Baker Street.\n\n      “I never was more glad to see anyone in my life,” said I as I\n      wrung him by the hand.\n\n      “Or more astonished, eh?”\n\n      “Well, I must confess to it.”\n\n      “The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no\n      idea that you had found my occasional retreat, still less that\n      you were inside it, until I was within twenty paces of the door.”\n\n      “My footprint, I presume?”\n\n      “No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your\n      footprint amid all the footprints of the world. If you seriously\n      desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I\n      see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know\n      that my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood. You will see it\n      there beside the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at that\n      supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut.”\n\n      “Exactly.”\n\n      “I thought as much—and knowing your admirable tenacity I was\n      convinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach,\n      waiting for the tenant to return. So you actually thought that I\n      was the criminal?”\n\n      “I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.”\n\n      “Excellent, Watson! And how did you localise me? You saw me,\n      perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so\n      imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?”\n\n      “Yes, I saw you then.”\n\n      “And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this\n      one?”\n\n      “No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where\n      to look.”\n\n      “The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not make\n      it out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.” He\n      rose and peeped into the hut. “Ha, I see that Cartwright has\n      brought up some supplies. What’s this paper? So you have been to\n      Coombe Tracey, have you?”\n\n      “Yes.”\n\n      “To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?”\n\n      “Exactly.”\n\n      “Well done! Our researches have evidently been running on\n      parallel lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall\n      have a fairly full knowledge of the case.”\n\n      “Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the\n      responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my\n      nerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what\n      have you been doing? I thought that you were in Baker Street\n      working out that case of blackmailing.”\n\n      “That was what I wished you to think.”\n\n      “Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!” I cried with some\n      bitterness. “I think that I have deserved better at your hands,\n      Holmes.”\n\n      “My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in\n      many other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have\n      seemed to play a trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your\n      own sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger\n      which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter\n      for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is confident\n      that my point of view would have been the same as yours, and my\n      presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on\n      their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about as I could\n      not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and I\n      remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all\n      my weight at a critical moment.”\n\n      “But why keep me in the dark?”\n\n      “For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have\n      led to my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something,\n      or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or\n      other, and so an unnecessary risk would be run. I brought\n      Cartwright down with me—you remember the little chap at the\n      express office—and he has seen after my simple wants: a loaf of\n      bread and a clean collar. What does man want more? He has given\n      me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet, and\n      both have been invaluable.”\n\n      “Then my reports have all been wasted!”—My voice trembled as I\n      recalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.\n\n      Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.\n\n      “Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I\n      assure you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only\n      delayed one day upon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly\n      upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an\n      extraordinarily difficult case.”\n\n      I was still rather raw over the deception which had been\n      practised upon me, but the warmth of Holmes’s praise drove my\n      anger from my mind. I felt also in my heart that he was right in\n      what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that I\n      should not have known that he was upon the moor.\n\n      “That’s better,” said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face.\n      “And now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons—it\n      was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you\n      had gone, for I am already aware that she is the one person in\n      Coombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the matter. In\n      fact, if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that I\n      should have gone tomorrow.”\n\n      The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had\n      turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There,\n      sitting together in the twilight, I told Holmes of my\n      conversation with the lady. So interested was he that I had to\n      repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied.\n\n      “This is most important,” said he when I had concluded. “It fills\n      up a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex\n      affair. You are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists\n      between this lady and the man Stapleton?”\n\n      “I did not know of a close intimacy.”\n\n      “There can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they write,\n      there is a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a\n      very powerful weapon into our hands. If I could only use it to\n      detach his wife—”\n\n      “His wife?”\n\n      “I am giving you some information now, in return for all that you\n      have given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is\n      in reality his wife.”\n\n      “Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could he\n      have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?”\n\n      “Sir Henry’s falling in love could do no harm to anyone except\n      Sir Henry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make\n      love to her, as you have yourself observed. I repeat that the\n      lady is his wife and not his sister.”\n\n      “But why this elaborate deception?”\n\n      “Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to\n      him in the character of a free woman.”\n\n      All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took\n      shape and centred upon the naturalist. In that impassive\n      colourless man, with his straw hat and his butterfly-net, I\n      seemed to see something terrible—a creature of infinite patience\n      and craft, with a smiling face and a murderous heart.\n\n      “It is he, then, who is our enemy—it is he who dogged us in\n      London?”\n\n      “So I read the riddle.”\n\n      “And the warning—it must have come from her!”\n\n      “Exactly.”\n\n      The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed,\n      loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long.\n\n      “But are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the woman\n      is his wife?”\n\n      “Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of\n      autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare\n      say he has many a time regretted it since. He was once a\n      schoolmaster in the north of England. Now, there is no one more\n      easy to trace than a schoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies\n      by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession.\n      A little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief\n      under atrocious circumstances, and that the man who had owned\n      it—the name was different—had disappeared with his wife. The\n      descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man was\n      devoted to entomology the identification was complete.”\n\n      The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the\n      shadows.\n\n      “If this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons\n      come in?” I asked.\n\n      “That is one of the points upon which your own researches have\n      shed a light. Your interview with the lady has cleared the\n      situation very much. I did not know about a projected divorce\n      between herself and her husband. In that case, regarding\n      Stapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming\n      his wife.”\n\n      “And when she is undeceived?”\n\n      “Why, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our first\n      duty to see her—both of us—tomorrow. Don’t you think, Watson,\n      that you are away from your charge rather long? Your place should\n      be at Baskerville Hall.”\n\n      The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had\n      settled upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a\n      violet sky.\n\n      “One last question, Holmes,” I said as I rose. “Surely there is\n      no need of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it\n      all? What is he after?”\n\n      Holmes’s voice sank as he answered:\n\n      “It is murder, Watson—refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder.\n      Do not ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even\n      as his are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already\n      almost at my mercy. There is but one danger which can threaten\n      us. It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so.\n      Another day—two at the most—and I have my case complete, but\n      until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother\n      watched her ailing child. Your mission today has justified\n      itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his\n      side. Hark!”\n\n      A terrible scream—a prolonged yell of horror and anguish—burst\n      out of the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the\n      blood to ice in my veins.\n\n      “Oh, my God!” I gasped. “What is it? What does it mean?”\n\n      Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic\n      outline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head\n      thrust forward, his face peering into the darkness.\n\n      “Hush!” he whispered. “Hush!”\n\n      The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had\n      pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it\n      burst upon our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before.\n\n      “Where is it?” Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of\n      his voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul.\n      “Where is it, Watson?”\n\n      “There, I think.” I pointed into the darkness.\n\n      “No, there!”\n\n      Again the agonised cry swept through the silent night, louder and\n      much nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep,\n      muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling\n      like the low, constant murmur of the sea.\n\n      “The hound!” cried Holmes. “Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if\n      we are too late!”\n\n      He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed\n      at his heels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground\n      immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell,\n      and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted and listened. Not another\n      sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night.\n\n      I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted.\n      He stamped his feet upon the ground.\n\n      “He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.”\n\n      “No, no, surely not!”\n\n      “Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes\n      of abandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has\n      happened we’ll avenge him!”\n\n      Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders,\n      forcing our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and\n      rushing down slopes, heading always in the direction whence those\n      dreadful sounds had come. At every rise Holmes looked eagerly\n      round him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor, and nothing\n      moved upon its dreary face.\n\n      “Can you see anything?”\n\n      “Nothing.”\n\n      “But, hark, what is that?”\n\n      A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our\n      left! On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which\n      overlooked a stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was\n      spread-eagled some dark, irregular object. As we ran towards it\n      the vague outline hardened into a definite shape. It was a\n      prostrate man face downward upon the ground, the head doubled\n      under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the body\n      hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault. So\n      grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant\n      realise that that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a\n      whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which\n      we stooped. Holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again\n      with an exclamation of horror. The gleam of the match which he\n      struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool\n      which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim. And it\n      shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint\n      within us—the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!\n\n      There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar\n      ruddy tweed suit—the very one which he had worn on the first\n      morning that we had seen him in Baker Street. We caught the one\n      clear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered and went out,\n      even as the hope had gone out of our souls. Holmes groaned, and\n      his face glimmered white through the darkness.\n\n      “The brute! The brute!” I cried with clenched hands. “Oh Holmes,\n      I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.”\n\n      “I am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case\n      well rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my\n      client. It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my\n      career. But how could I know—how _could_ I know—that he would\n      risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my\n      warnings?”\n\n      “That we should have heard his screams—my God, those screams!—and\n      yet have been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a hound\n      which drove him to his death? It may be lurking among these rocks\n      at this instant. And Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer for\n      this deed.”\n\n      “He shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been\n      murdered—the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast\n      which he thought to be supernatural, the other driven to his end\n      in his wild flight to escape from it. But now we have to prove\n      the connection between the man and the beast. Save from what we\n      heard, we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter, since\n      Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall. But, by heavens,\n      cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power before another\n      day is past!”\n\n      We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,\n      overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had\n      brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then\n      as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which\n      our poor friend had fallen, and from the summit we gazed out over\n      the shadowy moor, half silver and half gloom. Far away, miles\n      off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady yellow light\n      was shining. It could only come from the lonely abode of the\n      Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed.\n\n      “Why should we not seize him at once?”\n\n      “Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the\n      last degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we\n      make one false move the villain may escape us yet.”\n\n      “What can we do?”\n\n      “There will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only\n      perform the last offices to our poor friend.”\n\n      Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and\n      approached the body, black and clear against the silvered stones.\n      The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain\n      and blurred my eyes with tears.\n\n      “We must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the way\n      to the Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?”\n\n      He had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing\n      and laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern,\n      self-contained friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!\n\n      “A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!”\n\n      “A beard?”\n\n      “It is not the baronet—it is—why, it is my neighbour, the\n      convict!”\n\n      With feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that\n      dripping beard was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There\n      could be no doubt about the beetling forehead, the sunken animal\n      eyes. It was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the\n      light of the candle from over the rock—the face of Selden, the\n      criminal.\n\n      Then in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the\n      baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to\n      Barrymore. Barrymore had passed it on in order to help Selden in\n      his escape. Boots, shirt, cap—it was all Sir Henry’s. The tragedy\n      was still black enough, but this man had at least deserved death\n      by the laws of his country. I told Holmes how the matter stood,\n      my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy.\n\n      “Then the clothes have been the poor devil’s death,” said he. “It\n      is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article\n      of Sir Henry’s—the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all\n      probability—and so ran this man down. There is one very singular\n      thing, however: How came Selden, in the darkness, to know that\n      the hound was on his trail?”\n\n      “He heard him.”\n\n      “To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like\n      this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk\n      recapture by screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must have\n      run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track. How did\n      he know?”\n\n      “A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all\n      our conjectures are correct—”\n\n      “I presume nothing.”\n\n      “Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose\n      that it does not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would\n      not let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would\n      be there.”\n\n      “My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think\n      that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while\n      mine may remain forever a mystery. The question now is, what\n      shall we do with this poor wretch’s body? We cannot leave it here\n      to the foxes and the ravens.”\n\n      “I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can\n      communicate with the police.”\n\n      “Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far.\n      Halloa, Watson, what’s this? It’s the man himself, by all that’s\n      wonderful and audacious! Not a word to show your suspicions—not a\n      word, or my plans crumble to the ground.”\n\n      A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red\n      glow of a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish\n      the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped\n      when he saw us, and then came on again.\n\n      “Why, Dr. Watson, that’s not you, is it? You are the last man\n      that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time\n      of night. But, dear me, what’s this? Somebody hurt? Not—don’t\n      tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!” He hurried past me and\n      stooped over the dead man. I heard a sharp intake of his breath\n      and the cigar fell from his fingers.\n\n      “Who—who’s this?” he stammered.\n\n      “It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.”\n\n      Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort\n      he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked\n      sharply from Holmes to me. “Dear me! What a very shocking affair!\n      How did he die?”\n\n      “He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks.\n      My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.”\n\n      “I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy\n      about Sir Henry.”\n\n      “Why about Sir Henry in particular?” I could not help asking.\n\n      “Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did\n      not come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his\n      safety when I heard cries upon the moor. By the way”—his eyes\n      darted again from my face to Holmes’s—“did you hear anything else\n      besides a cry?”\n\n      “No,” said Holmes; “did you?”\n\n      “No.”\n\n      “What do you mean, then?”\n\n      “Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom\n      hound, and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor.\n      I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound\n      tonight.”\n\n      “We heard nothing of the kind,” said I.\n\n      “And what is your theory of this poor fellow’s death?”\n\n      “I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off\n      his head. He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and\n      eventually fallen over here and broken his neck.”\n\n      “That seems the most reasonable theory,” said Stapleton, and he\n      gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief. “What do you\n      think about it, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”\n\n      My friend bowed his compliments. “You are quick at\n      identification,” said he.\n\n      “We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came\n      down. You are in time to see a tragedy.”\n\n      “Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend’s explanation will\n      cover the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to\n      London with me tomorrow.”\n\n      “Oh, you return tomorrow?”\n\n      “That is my intention.”\n\n      “I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences\n      which have puzzled us?”\n\n      Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\n\n      “One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An\n      investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has not\n      been a satisfactory case.”\n\n      My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner.\n      Stapleton still looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.\n\n      “I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it\n      would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified\n      in doing it. I think that if we put something over his face he\n      will be safe until morning.”\n\n      And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton’s offer of\n      hospitality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving\n      the naturalist to return alone. Looking back we saw the figure\n      moving slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that one\n      black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was\n      lying who had come so horribly to his end.\n\n      “We’re at close grips at last,” said Holmes as we walked together\n      across the moor. “What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled\n      himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing\n      shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his\n      plot. I told you in London, Watson, and I tell you now again,\n      that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel.”\n\n      “I am sorry that he has seen you.”\n\n      “And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.”\n\n      “What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he\n      knows you are here?”\n\n      “It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to\n      desperate measures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be\n      too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has\n      completely deceived us.”\n\n      “Why should we not arrest him at once?”\n\n      “My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your\n      instinct is always to do something energetic. But supposing, for\n      argument’s sake, that we had him arrested tonight, what on earth\n      the better off should we be for that? We could prove nothing\n      against him. There’s the devilish cunning of it! If he were\n      acting through a human agent we could get some evidence, but if\n      we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not\n      help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.”\n\n      “Surely we have a case.”\n\n      “Not a shadow of one—only surmise and conjecture. We should be\n      laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such\n      evidence.”\n\n      “There is Sir Charles’s death.”\n\n      “Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died\n      of sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how\n      are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are\n      there of a hound? Where are the marks of its fangs? Of course we\n      know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles\n      was dead before ever the brute overtook him. But we have to prove\n      all this, and we are not in a position to do it.”\n\n      “Well, then, tonight?”\n\n      “We are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct\n      connection between the hound and the man’s death. We never saw\n      the hound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was\n      running upon this man’s trail. There is a complete absence of\n      motive. No, my dear fellow; we must reconcile ourselves to the\n      fact that we have no case at present, and that it is worth our\n      while to run any risk in order to establish one.”\n\n      “And how do you propose to do so?”\n\n      “I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when\n      the position of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own\n      plan as well. Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I\n      hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last.”\n\n      I could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in\n      thought, as far as the Baskerville gates.\n\n      “Are you coming up?”\n\n      “Yes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word,\n      Watson. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him think that\n      Selden’s death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will\n      have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo\n      tomorrow, when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright,\n      to dine with these people.”\n\n      “And so am I.”\n\n      “Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be\n      easily arranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think\n      that we are both ready for our suppers.”\n\n\n\n\nChapter 13.\nFixing the Nets\n\n\n      Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes,\n      for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would\n      bring him down from London. He did raise his eyebrows, however,\n      when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any\n      explanations for its absence. Between us we soon supplied his\n      wants, and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet\n      as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should\n      know. But first I had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to\n      Barrymore and his wife. To him it may have been an unmitigated\n      relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. To all the world he\n      was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her\n      he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the\n      child who had clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has\n      not one woman to mourn him.\n\n      “I’ve been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in\n      the morning,” said the baronet. “I guess I should have some\n      credit, for I have kept my promise. If I hadn’t sworn not to go\n      about alone I might have had a more lively evening, for I had a\n      message from Stapleton asking me over there.”\n\n      “I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,”\n      said Holmes drily. “By the way, I don’t suppose you appreciate\n      that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck?”\n\n      Sir Henry opened his eyes. “How was that?”\n\n      “This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your\n      servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the\n      police.”\n\n      “That is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far as I\n      know.”\n\n      “That’s lucky for him—in fact, it’s lucky for all of you, since\n      you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am not\n      sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to\n      arrest the whole household. Watson’s reports are most\n      incriminating documents.”\n\n      “But how about the case?” asked the baronet. “Have you made\n      anything out of the tangle? I don’t know that Watson and I are\n      much the wiser since we came down.”\n\n      “I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation\n      rather more clear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly\n      difficult and most complicated business. There are several points\n      upon which we still want light—but it is coming all the same.”\n\n      “We’ve had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We\n      heard the hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all\n      empty superstition. I had something to do with dogs when I was\n      out West, and I know one when I hear one. If you can muzzle that\n      one and put him on a chain I’ll be ready to swear you are the\n      greatest detective of all time.”\n\n      “I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will\n      give me your help.”\n\n      “Whatever you tell me to do I will do.”\n\n      “Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without\n      always asking the reason.”\n\n      “Just as you like.”\n\n      “If you will do this I think the chances are that our little\n      problem will soon be solved. I have no doubt—”\n\n      He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the\n      air. The lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so\n      still that it might have been that of a clear-cut classical\n      statue, a personification of alertness and expectation.\n\n      “What is it?” we both cried.\n\n      I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some\n      internal emotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes\n      shone with amused exultation.\n\n      “Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur,” said he as he waved his\n      hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite\n      wall. “Watson won’t allow that I know anything of art but that is\n      mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ. Now,\n      these are a really very fine series of portraits.”\n\n      “Well, I’m glad to hear you say so,” said Sir Henry, glancing\n      with some surprise at my friend. “I don’t pretend to know much\n      about these things, and I’d be a better judge of a horse or a\n      steer than of a picture. I didn’t know that you found time for\n      such things.”\n\n      “I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That’s a\n      Kneller, I’ll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and\n      the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are\n      all family portraits, I presume?”\n\n      “Every one.”\n\n      “Do you know the names?”\n\n      “Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my\n      lessons fairly well.”\n\n      “Who is the gentleman with the telescope?”\n\n      “That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the\n      West Indies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is\n      Sir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the\n      House of Commons under Pitt.”\n\n      “And this Cavalier opposite to me—the one with the black velvet\n      and the lace?”\n\n      “Ah, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of all\n      the mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the\n      Baskervilles. We’re not likely to forget him.”\n\n      I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.\n\n      “Dear me!” said Holmes, “he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man\n      enough, but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his\n      eyes. I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person.”\n\n      “There’s no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the\n      date, 1647, are on the back of the canvas.”\n\n      Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer\n      seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were\n      continually fixed upon it during supper. It was not until later,\n      when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow\n      the trend of his thoughts. He led me back into the\n      banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he held it\n      up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.\n\n      “Do you see anything there?”\n\n      I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the\n      white lace collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed\n      between them. It was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim,\n      hard, and stern, with a firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly\n      intolerant eye.\n\n      “Is it like anyone you know?”\n\n      “There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.”\n\n      “Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!” He stood upon\n      a chair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved\n      his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.\n\n      “Good heavens!” I cried in amazement.\n\n      The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.\n\n      “Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces\n      and not their trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal\n      investigator that he should see through a disguise.”\n\n      “But this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.”\n\n      “Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears\n      to be both physical and spiritual. A study of family portraits is\n      enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. The\n      fellow is a Baskerville—that is evident.”\n\n      “With designs upon the succession.”\n\n      “Exactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of\n      our most obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him,\n      and I dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering\n      in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies. A pin, a\n      cork, and a card, and we add him to the Baker Street collection!”\n      He burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away\n      from the picture. I have not heard him laugh often, and it has\n      always boded ill to somebody.\n\n      I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier\n      still, for I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.\n\n      “Yes, we should have a full day today,” he remarked, and he\n      rubbed his hands with the joy of action. “The nets are all in\n      place, and the drag is about to begin. We’ll know before the day\n      is out whether we have caught our big, lean-jawed pike, or\n      whether he has got through the meshes.”\n\n      “Have you been on the moor already?”\n\n      “I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death\n      of Selden. I think I can promise that none of you will be\n      troubled in the matter. And I have also communicated with my\n      faithful Cartwright, who would certainly have pined away at the\n      door of my hut, as a dog does at his master’s grave, if I had not\n      set his mind at rest about my safety.”\n\n      “What is the next move?”\n\n      “To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!”\n\n      “Good-morning, Holmes,” said the baronet. “You look like a\n      general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff.”\n\n      “That is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.”\n\n      “And so do I.”\n\n      “Very good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our\n      friends the Stapletons tonight.”\n\n      “I hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people,\n      and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you.”\n\n      “I fear that Watson and I must go to London.”\n\n      “To London?”\n\n      “Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present\n      juncture.”\n\n      The baronet’s face perceptibly lengthened.\n\n      “I hoped that you were going to see me through this business. The\n      Hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is\n      alone.”\n\n      “My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what\n      I tell you. You can tell your friends that we should have been\n      happy to have come with you, but that urgent business required us\n      to be in town. We hope very soon to return to Devonshire. Will\n      you remember to give them that message?”\n\n      “If you insist upon it.”\n\n      “There is no alternative, I assure you.”\n\n      I saw by the baronet’s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by\n      what he regarded as our desertion.\n\n      “When do you desire to go?” he asked coldly.\n\n      “Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey,\n      but Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come\n      back to you. Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell\n      him that you regret that you cannot come.”\n\n      “I have a good mind to go to London with you,” said the baronet.\n      “Why should I stay here alone?”\n\n      “Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word\n      that you would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.”\n\n      “All right, then, I’ll stay.”\n\n      “One more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send\n      back your trap, however, and let them know that you intend to\n      walk home.”\n\n      “To walk across the moor?”\n\n      “Yes.”\n\n      “But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me\n      not to do.”\n\n      “This time you may do it with safety. If I had not every\n      confidence in your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but\n      it is essential that you should do it.”\n\n      “Then I will do it.”\n\n      “And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any\n      direction save along the straight path which leads from Merripit\n      House to the Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.”\n\n      “I will do just what you say.”\n\n      “Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast\n      as possible, so as to reach London in the afternoon.”\n\n      I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that\n      Holmes had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit\n      would terminate next day. It had not crossed my mind however,\n      that he would wish me to go with him, nor could I understand how\n      we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to\n      be critical. There was nothing for it, however, but implicit\n      obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful friend, and a couple\n      of hours afterwards we were at the station of Coombe Tracey and\n      had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A small boy was\n      waiting upon the platform.\n\n      “Any orders, sir?”\n\n      “You will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you\n      arrive you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name,\n      to say that if he finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is\n      to send it by registered post to Baker Street.”\n\n      “Yes, sir.”\n\n      “And ask at the station office if there is a message for me.”\n\n      The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It\n      ran:\n\n      Wire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive\n      five-forty. Lestrade.\n\n      “That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the\n      professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now,\n      Watson, I think that we cannot employ our time better than by\n      calling upon your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.”\n\n      His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would use\n      the baronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were\n      really gone, while we should actually return at the instant when\n      we were likely to be needed. That telegram from London, if\n      mentioned by Sir Henry to the Stapletons, must remove the last\n      suspicions from their minds. Already I seemed to see our nets\n      drawing closer around that lean-jawed pike.\n\n      Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened\n      his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably\n      amazed her.\n\n      “I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of\n      the late Sir Charles Baskerville,” said he. “My friend here, Dr.\n      Watson, has informed me of what you have communicated, and also\n      of what you have withheld in connection with that matter.”\n\n      “What have I withheld?” she asked defiantly.\n\n      “You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate\n      at ten o’clock. We know that that was the place and hour of his\n      death. You have withheld what the connection is between these\n      events.”\n\n      “There is no connection.”\n\n      “In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary\n      one. But I think that we shall succeed in establishing a\n      connection, after all. I wish to be perfectly frank with you,\n      Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as one of murder, and the\n      evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr. Stapleton but his\n      wife as well.”\n\n      The lady sprang from her chair.\n\n      “His wife!” she cried.\n\n      “The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for\n      his sister is really his wife.”\n\n      Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms\n      of her chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with\n      the pressure of her grip.\n\n      “His wife!” she said again. “His wife! He is not a married man.”\n\n      Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\n\n      “Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so—!”\n\n      The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.\n\n      “I have come prepared to do so,” said Holmes, drawing several\n      papers from his pocket. “Here is a photograph of the couple taken\n      in York four years ago. It is indorsed ‘Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,’\n      but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him, and her also,\n      if you know her by sight. Here are three written descriptions by\n      trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time\n      kept St. Oliver’s private school. Read them and see if you can\n      doubt the identity of these people.”\n\n      She glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid\n      face of a desperate woman.\n\n      “Mr. Holmes,” she said, “this man had offered me marriage on\n      condition that I could get a divorce from my husband. He has lied\n      to me, the villain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of\n      truth has he ever told me. And why—why? I imagined that all was\n      for my own sake. But now I see that I was never anything but a\n      tool in his hands. Why should I preserve faith with him who never\n      kept any with me? Why should I try to shield him from the\n      consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me what you like, and\n      there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear to\n      you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of\n      any harm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.”\n\n      “I entirely believe you, madam,” said Sherlock Holmes. “The\n      recital of these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps\n      it will make it easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can\n      check me if I make any material mistake. The sending of this\n      letter was suggested to you by Stapleton?”\n\n      “He dictated it.”\n\n      “I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive\n      help from Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your\n      divorce?”\n\n      “Exactly.”\n\n      “And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from\n      keeping the appointment?”\n\n      “He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other\n      man should find the money for such an object, and that though he\n      was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing\n      the obstacles which divided us.”\n\n      “He appears to be a very consistent character. And then you heard\n      nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?”\n\n      “No.”\n\n      “And he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with\n      Sir Charles?”\n\n      “He did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and\n      that I should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He\n      frightened me into remaining silent.”\n\n      “Quite so. But you had your suspicions?”\n\n      She hesitated and looked down.\n\n      “I knew him,” she said. “But if he had kept faith with me I\n      should always have done so with him.”\n\n      “I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,” said\n      Sherlock Holmes. “You have had him in your power and he knew it,\n      and yet you are alive. You have been walking for some months very\n      near to the edge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morning\n      now, Mrs. Lyons, and it is probable that you will very shortly\n      hear from us again.”\n\n      “Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty\n      thins away in front of us,” said Holmes as we stood waiting for\n      the arrival of the express from town. “I shall soon be in the\n      position of being able to put into a single connected narrative\n      one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times.\n      Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in\n      Godno, in Little Russia, in the year ’66, and of course there are\n      the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case possesses\n      some features which are entirely its own. Even now we have no\n      clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very much\n      surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this\n      night.”\n\n      The London express came roaring into the station, and a small,\n      wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We\n      all three shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way\n      in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a\n      good deal since the days when they had first worked together. I\n      could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner\n      used then to excite in the practical man.\n\n      “Anything good?” he asked.\n\n      “The biggest thing for years,” said Holmes. “We have two hours\n      before we need think of starting. I think we might employ it in\n      getting some dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London\n      fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night\n      air of Dartmoor. Never been there? Ah, well, I don’t suppose you\n      will forget your first visit.”\n\n\n\n\nChapter 14.\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\n\n\n      One of Sherlock Holmes’s defects—if, indeed, one may call it a\n      defect—was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full\n      plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment.\n      Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which\n      loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him. Partly\n      also from his professional caution, which urged him never to take\n      any chances. The result, however, was very trying for those who\n      were acting as his agents and assistants. I had often suffered\n      under it, but never more so than during that long drive in the\n      darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we were\n      about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing,\n      and I could only surmise what his course of action would be. My\n      nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon\n      our faces and the dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow\n      road told me that we were back upon the moor once again. Every\n      stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us\n      nearer to our supreme adventure.\n\n      Our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of\n      the hired wagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial\n      matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation.\n      It was a relief to me, after that unnatural restraint, when we at\n      last passed Frankland’s house and knew that we were drawing near\n      to the Hall and to the scene of action. We did not drive up to\n      the door but got down near the gate of the avenue. The wagonette\n      was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe Tracey forthwith,\n      while we started to walk to Merripit House.\n\n      “Are you armed, Lestrade?”\n\n      The little detective smiled. “As long as I have my trousers I\n      have a hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have\n      something in it.”\n\n      “Good! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.”\n\n      “You’re mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What’s the\n      game now?”\n\n      “A waiting game.”\n\n      “My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place,” said the\n      detective with a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes\n      of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the\n      Grimpen Mire. “I see the lights of a house ahead of us.”\n\n      “That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must\n      request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.”\n\n      We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the\n      house, but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards\n      from it.\n\n      “This will do,” said he. “These rocks upon the right make an\n      admirable screen.”\n\n      “We are to wait here?”\n\n      “Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,\n      Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson?\n      Can you tell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed\n      windows at this end?”\n\n      “I think they are the kitchen windows.”\n\n      “And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?”\n\n      “That is certainly the dining-room.”\n\n      “The blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creep\n      forward quietly and see what they are doing—but for heaven’s sake\n      don’t let them know that they are watched!”\n\n      I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which\n      surrounded the stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached\n      a point whence I could look straight through the uncurtained\n      window.\n\n      There were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton.\n      They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the\n      round table. Both of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and\n      wine were in front of them. Stapleton was talking with animation,\n      but the baronet looked pale and distrait. Perhaps the thought of\n      that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily\n      upon his mind.\n\n      As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir\n      Henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair,\n      puffing at his cigar. I heard the creak of a door and the crisp\n      sound of boots upon gravel. The steps passed along the path on\n      the other side of the wall under which I crouched. Looking over,\n      I saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out-house in the\n      corner of the orchard. A key turned in a lock, and as he passed\n      in there was a curious scuffling noise from within. He was only a\n      minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn once more and\n      he passed me and reentered the house. I saw him rejoin his guest,\n      and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to\n      tell them what I had seen.\n\n      “You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?” Holmes asked when\n      I had finished my report.\n\n      “No.”\n\n      “Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other\n      room except the kitchen?”\n\n      “I cannot think where she is.”\n\n      I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense,\n      white fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked\n      itself up like a wall on that side of us, low but thick and well\n      defined. The moon shone on it, and it looked like a great\n      shimmering ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocks\n      borne upon its surface. Holmes’s face was turned towards it, and\n      he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.\n\n      “It’s moving towards us, Watson.”\n\n      “Is that serious?”\n\n      “Very serious, indeed—the one thing upon earth which could have\n      disarranged my plans. He can’t be very long, now. It is already\n      ten o’clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon his\n      coming out before the fog is over the path.”\n\n      The night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and\n      bright, while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft,\n      uncertain light. Before us lay the dark bulk of the house, its\n      serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the\n      silver-spangled sky. Broad bars of golden light from the lower\n      windows stretched across the orchard and the moor. One of them\n      was suddenly shut off. The servants had left the kitchen. There\n      only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the two men, the\n      murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted over\n      their cigars.\n\n      Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of\n      the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house. Already the\n      first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of\n      the lighted window. The farther wall of the orchard was already\n      invisible, and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white\n      vapour. As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round both\n      corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on\n      which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship\n      upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand passionately upon the\n      rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience.\n\n      “If he isn’t out in a quarter of an hour the path will be\n      covered. In half an hour we won’t be able to see our hands in\n      front of us.”\n\n      “Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?”\n\n      “Yes, I think it would be as well.”\n\n      So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we\n      were half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea,\n      with the moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and\n      inexorably on.\n\n      “We are going too far,” said Holmes. “We dare not take the chance\n      of his being overtaken before he can reach us. At all costs we\n      must hold our ground where we are.” He dropped on his knees and\n      clapped his ear to the ground. “Thank God, I think that I hear\n      him coming.”\n\n      A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouching\n      among the stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in\n      front of us. The steps grew louder, and through the fog, as\n      through a curtain, there stepped the man whom we were awaiting.\n      He looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear,\n      starlit night. Then he came swiftly along the path, passed close\n      to where we lay, and went on up the long slope behind us. As he\n      walked he glanced continually over either shoulder, like a man\n      who is ill at ease.\n\n      “Hist!” cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking\n      pistol. “Look out! It’s coming!”\n\n      There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the\n      heart of that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of\n      where we lay, and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what\n      horror was about to break from the heart of it. I was at Holmes’s\n      elbow, and I glanced for an instant at his face. It was pale and\n      exultant, his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight. But\n      suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and his\n      lips parted in amazement. At the same instant Lestrade gave a\n      yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground. I\n      sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind\n      paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from\n      the shadows of the fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black\n      hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire\n      burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a smouldering\n      glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in\n      flickering flame. Never in the delirious dream of a disordered\n      brain could anything more savage, more appalling, more hellish be\n      conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us\n      out of the wall of fog.\n\n      With long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the\n      track, following hard upon the footsteps of our friend. So\n      paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass\n      before we had recovered our nerve. Then Holmes and I both fired\n      together, and the creature gave a hideous howl, which showed that\n      one at least had hit him. He did not pause, however, but bounded\n      onward. Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry looking back, his\n      face white in the moonlight, his hands raised in horror, glaring\n      helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down. But\n      that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the\n      winds. If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound\n      him we could kill him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran\n      that night. I am reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as\n      much as I outpaced the little professional. In front of us as we\n      flew up the track we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and\n      the deep roar of the hound. I was in time to see the beast spring\n      upon its victim, hurl him to the ground, and worry at his throat.\n      But the next instant Holmes had emptied five barrels of his\n      revolver into the creature’s flank. With a last howl of agony and\n      a vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon its back, four feet\n      pawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. I stooped,\n      panting, and pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head,\n      but it was useless to press the trigger. The giant hound was\n      dead.\n\n      Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his\n      collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw\n      that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in\n      time. Already our friend’s eyelids shivered and he made a feeble\n      effort to move. Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the\n      baronet’s teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at us.\n\n      “My God!” he whispered. “What was it? What, in heaven’s name, was\n      it?”\n\n      “It’s dead, whatever it is,” said Holmes. “We’ve laid the family\n      ghost once and forever.”\n\n      In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was\n      lying stretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it\n      was not a pure mastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of\n      the two—gaunt, savage, and as large as a small lioness. Even now\n      in the stillness of death, the huge jaws seemed to be dripping\n      with a bluish flame and the small, deep-set, cruel eyes were\n      ringed with fire. I placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle, and\n      as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the\n      darkness.\n\n      “Phosphorus,” I said.\n\n      “A cunning preparation of it,” said Holmes, sniffing at the dead\n      animal. “There is no smell which might have interfered with his\n      power of scent. We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having\n      exposed you to this fright. I was prepared for a hound, but not\n      for such a creature as this. And the fog gave us little time to\n      receive him.”\n\n      “You have saved my life.”\n\n      “Having first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?”\n\n      “Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for\n      anything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose to\n      do?”\n\n      “To leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures\n      tonight. If you will wait, one or other of us will go back with\n      you to the Hall.”\n\n      He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale\n      and trembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where he\n      sat shivering with his face buried in his hands.\n\n      “We must leave you now,” said Holmes. “The rest of our work must\n      be done, and every moment is of importance. We have our case, and\n      now we only want our man.\n\n      “It’s a thousand to one against our finding him at the house,” he\n      continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. “Those\n      shots must have told him that the game was up.”\n\n      “We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.”\n\n      “He followed the hound to call him off—of that you may be\n      certain. No, no, he’s gone by this time! But we’ll search the\n      house and make sure.”\n\n      The front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to\n      room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us\n      in the passage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but\n      Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house\n      unexplored. No sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing.\n      On the upper floor, however, one of the bedroom doors was locked.\n\n      “There’s someone in here,” cried Lestrade. “I can hear a\n      movement. Open this door!”\n\n      A faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck the\n      door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew\n      open. Pistol in hand, we all three rushed into the room.\n\n      But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant\n      villain whom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an\n      object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment\n      staring at it in amazement.\n\n      The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls\n      were lined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that\n      collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had\n      been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man. In the\n      centre of this room there was an upright beam, which had been\n      placed at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten baulk\n      of timber which spanned the roof. To this post a figure was tied,\n      so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to\n      secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was\n      that of a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat and\n      was secured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the lower\n      part of the face, and over it two dark eyes—eyes full of grief\n      and shame and a dreadful questioning—stared back at us. In a\n      minute we had torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs.\n      Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us. As her beautiful\n      head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash\n      across her neck.\n\n      “The brute!” cried Holmes. “Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle!\n      Put her in the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and\n      exhaustion.”\n\n      She opened her eyes again.\n\n      “Is he safe?” she asked. “Has he escaped?”\n\n      “He cannot escape us, madam.”\n\n      “No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?”\n\n      “Yes.”\n\n      “And the hound?”\n\n      “It is dead.”\n\n      She gave a long sigh of satisfaction.\n\n      “Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has treated\n      me!” She shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with\n      horror that they were all mottled with bruises. “But this is\n      nothing—nothing! It is my mind and soul that he has tortured and\n      defiled. I could endure it all, ill-usage, solitude, a life of\n      deception, everything, as long as I could still cling to the hope\n      that I had his love, but now I know that in this also I have been\n      his dupe and his tool.” She broke into passionate sobbing as she\n      spoke.\n\n      “You bear him no good will, madam,” said Holmes. “Tell us then\n      where we shall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, help\n      us now and so atone.”\n\n      “There is but one place where he can have fled,” she answered.\n      “There is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire.\n      It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made\n      preparations so that he might have a refuge. That is where he\n      would fly.”\n\n      The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held\n      the lamp towards it.\n\n      “See,” said he. “No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire\n      tonight.”\n\n      She laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed\n      with fierce merriment.\n\n      “He may find his way in, but never out,” she cried. “How can he\n      see the guiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he and\n      I, to mark the pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have\n      plucked them out today. Then indeed you would have had him at\n      your mercy!”\n\n      It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog\n      had lifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house\n      while Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville\n      Hall. The story of the Stapletons could no longer be withheld\n      from him, but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth\n      about the woman whom he had loved. But the shock of the night’s\n      adventures had shattered his nerves, and before morning he lay\n      delirious in a high fever under the care of Dr. Mortimer. The two\n      of them were destined to travel together round the world before\n      Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he had\n      been before he became master of that ill-omened estate.\n\n      And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular\n      narrative, in which I have tried to make the reader share those\n      dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and\n      ended in so tragic a manner. On the morning after the death of\n      the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton\n      to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog. It\n      helped us to realise the horror of this woman’s life when we saw\n      the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband’s\n      track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm,\n      peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. From the\n      end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the\n      path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those\n      green-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the\n      stranger. Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour\n      of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces, while a\n      false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark,\n      quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around\n      our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked,\n      and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was\n      tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful\n      was the clutch in which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that\n      someone had passed that perilous way before us. From amid a tuft\n      of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing\n      was projecting. Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the\n      path to seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out he\n      could never have set his foot upon firm land again. He held an\n      old black boot in the air. “Meyers, Toronto,” was printed on the\n      leather inside.\n\n      “It is worth a mud bath,” said he. “It is our friend Sir Henry’s\n      missing boot.”\n\n      “Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight.”\n\n      “Exactly. He retained it in his hand after using it to set the\n      hound upon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, still\n      clutching it. And he hurled it away at this point of his flight.\n      We know at least that he came so far in safety.”\n\n      But more than that we were never destined to know, though there\n      was much which we might surmise. There was no chance of finding\n      footsteps in the mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon\n      them, but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass\n      we all looked eagerly for them. But no slightest sign of them\n      ever met our eyes. If the earth told a true story, then Stapleton\n      never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled\n      through the fog upon that last night. Somewhere in the heart of\n      the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge morass\n      which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is\n      forever buried.\n\n      Many traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had\n      hid his savage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled\n      with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside it\n      were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners, driven\n      away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp. In one\n      of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones\n      showed where the animal had been confined. A skeleton with a\n      tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the _débris_.\n\n      “A dog!” said Holmes. “By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor\n      Mortimer will never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that\n      this place contains any secret which we have not already\n      fathomed. He could hide his hound, but he could not hush its\n      voice, and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not\n      pleasant to hear. On an emergency he could keep the hound in the\n      out-house at Merripit, but it was always a risk, and it was only\n      on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end of all his\n      efforts, that he dared do it. This paste in the tin is no doubt\n      the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. It was\n      suggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and\n      by the desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death. No wonder the\n      poor devil of a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did,\n      and as we ourselves might have done, when he saw such a creature\n      bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track. It was\n      a cunning device, for, apart from the chance of driving your\n      victim to his death, what peasant would venture to inquire too\n      closely into such a creature should he get sight of it, as many\n      have done, upon the moor? I said it in London, Watson, and I say\n      it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more\n      dangerous man than he who is lying yonder”—he swept his long arm\n      towards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which\n      stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the\n      moor.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 15.\nA Retrospection\n\n\n      It was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and\n      foggy night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room\n      in Baker Street. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to\n      Devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost\n      importance, in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious\n      conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection with the famous card\n      scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second he had\n      defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge of\n      murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her\n      step-daughter, Mlle. Carére, the young lady who, as it will be\n      remembered, was found six months later alive and married in New\n      York. My friend was in excellent spirits over the success which\n      had attended a succession of difficult and important cases, so\n      that I was able to induce him to discuss the details of the\n      Baskerville mystery. I had waited patiently for the opportunity\n      for I was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap, and\n      that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its\n      present work to dwell upon memories of the past. Sir Henry and\n      Dr. Mortimer were, however, in London, on their way to that long\n      voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his\n      shattered nerves. They had called upon us that very afternoon, so\n      that it was natural that the subject should come up for\n      discussion.\n\n      “The whole course of events,” said Holmes, “from the point of\n      view of the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and\n      direct, although to us, who had no means in the beginning of\n      knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of\n      the facts, it all appeared exceedingly complex. I have had the\n      advantage of two conversations with Mrs. Stapleton, and the case\n      has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware that\n      there is anything which has remained a secret to us. You will\n      find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my\n      indexed list of cases.”\n\n      “Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of\n      events from memory.”\n\n      “Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts\n      in my mind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of\n      blotting out what has passed. The barrister who has his case at\n      his fingers’ ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his\n      own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it\n      all out of his head once more. So each of my cases displaces the\n      last, and Mlle. Carére has blurred my recollection of Baskerville\n      Hall. Tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to my\n      notice which will in turn dispossess the fair French lady and the\n      infamous Upwood. So far as the case of the hound goes, however, I\n      will give you the course of events as nearly as I can, and you\n      will suggest anything which I may have forgotten.\n\n      “My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait\n      did not lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He\n      was a son of that Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir\n      Charles, who fled with a sinister reputation to South America,\n      where he was said to have died unmarried. He did, as a matter of\n      fact, marry, and had one child, this fellow, whose real name is\n      the same as his father’s. He married Beryl Garcia, one of the\n      beauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a considerable sum\n      of public money, he changed his name to Vandeleur and fled to\n      England, where he established a school in the east of Yorkshire.\n      His reason for attempting this special line of business was that\n      he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon\n      the voyage home, and that he had used this man’s ability to make\n      the undertaking a success. Fraser, the tutor, died however, and\n      the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy.\n      The Vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to\n      Stapleton, and he brought the remains of his fortune, his schemes\n      for the future, and his taste for entomology to the south of\n      England. I learned at the British Museum that he was a recognized\n      authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur has\n      been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in his\n      Yorkshire days, been the first to describe.\n\n      “We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be\n      of such intense interest to us. The fellow had evidently made\n      inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and\n      a valuable estate. When he went to Devonshire his plans were, I\n      believe, exceedingly hazy, but that he meant mischief from the\n      first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him\n      in the character of his sister. The idea of using her as a decoy\n      was clearly already in his mind, though he may not have been\n      certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. He meant\n      in the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool\n      or run any risk for that end. His first act was to establish\n      himself as near to his ancestral home as he could, and his second\n      was to cultivate a friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and\n      with the neighbours.\n\n      “The baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so\n      prepared the way for his own death. Stapleton, as I will continue\n      to call him, knew that the old man’s heart was weak and that a\n      shock would kill him. So much he had learned from Dr. Mortimer.\n      He had heard also that Sir Charles was superstitious and had\n      taken this grim legend very seriously. His ingenious mind\n      instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to\n      death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the\n      guilt to the real murderer.\n\n      “Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with\n      considerable finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been content\n      to work with a savage hound. The use of artificial means to make\n      the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part. The\n      dog he bought in London from Ross and Mangles, the dealers in\n      Fulham Road. It was the strongest and most savage in their\n      possession. He brought it down by the North Devon line and walked\n      a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without\n      exciting any remarks. He had already on his insect hunts learned\n      to penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a safe\n      hiding-place for the creature. Here he kennelled it and waited\n      his chance.\n\n      “But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be\n      decoyed outside of his grounds at night. Several times Stapleton\n      lurked about with his hound, but without avail. It was during\n      these fruitless quests that he, or rather his ally, was seen by\n      peasants, and that the legend of the demon dog received a new\n      confirmation. He had hoped that his wife might lure Sir Charles\n      to his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly independent. She\n      would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a\n      sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy.\n      Threats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her.\n      She would have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton\n      was at a deadlock.\n\n      “He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that\n      Sir Charles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him the\n      minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman,\n      Mrs. Laura Lyons. By representing himself as a single man he\n      acquired complete influence over her, and he gave her to\n      understand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her\n      husband he would marry her. His plans were suddenly brought to a\n      head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about to leave the\n      Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he himself\n      pretended to coincide. He must act at once, or his victim might\n      get beyond his power. He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons\n      to write this letter, imploring the old man to give her an\n      interview on the evening before his departure for London. He\n      then, by a specious argument, prevented her from going, and so\n      had the chance for which he had waited.\n\n      “Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to\n      get his hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring\n      the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that\n      he would find the old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited by its\n      master, sprang over the wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate\n      baronet, who fled screaming down the yew alley. In that gloomy\n      tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge\n      black creature, with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes, bounding\n      after its victim. He fell dead at the end of the alley from heart\n      disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the grassy border\n      while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track but the\n      man’s was visible. On seeing him lying still the creature had\n      probably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead had\n      turned away again. It was then that it left the print which was\n      actually observed by Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off and\n      hurried away to its lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was\n      left which puzzled the authorities, alarmed the countryside, and\n      finally brought the case within the scope of our observation.\n\n      “So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. You perceive\n      the devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost\n      impossible to make a case against the real murderer. His only\n      accomplice was one who could never give him away, and the\n      grotesque, inconceivable nature of the device only served to make\n      it more effective. Both of the women concerned in the case, Mrs.\n      Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left with a strong suspicion\n      against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he had designs upon\n      the old man, and also of the existence of the hound. Mrs. Lyons\n      knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the death\n      occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was\n      only known to him. However, both of them were under his\n      influence, and he had nothing to fear from them. The first half\n      of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult\n      still remained.\n\n      “It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of\n      an heir in Canada. In any case he would very soon learn it from\n      his friend Dr. Mortimer, and he was told by the latter all\n      details about the arrival of Henry Baskerville. Stapleton’s first\n      idea was that this young stranger from Canada might possibly be\n      done to death in London without coming down to Devonshire at all.\n      He distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in\n      laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not leave her long\n      out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her.\n      It was for this reason that he took her to London with him. They\n      lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven\n      Street, which was actually one of those called upon by my agent\n      in search of evidence. Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her\n      room while he, disguised in a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to\n      Baker Street and afterwards to the station and to the\n      Northumberland Hotel. His wife had some inkling of his plans; but\n      she had such a fear of her husband—a fear founded upon brutal\n      ill-treatment—that she dare not write to warn the man whom she\n      knew to be in danger. If the letter should fall into Stapleton’s\n      hands her own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we know, she\n      adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form\n      the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand. It\n      reached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of his\n      danger.\n\n      “It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir\n      Henry’s attire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he\n      might always have the means of setting him upon his track. With\n      characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once,\n      and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber-maid of the hotel\n      was well bribed to help him in his design. By chance, however,\n      the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and,\n      therefore, useless for his purpose. He then had it returned and\n      obtained another—a most instructive incident, since it proved\n      conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound,\n      as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an\n      old boot and this indifference to a new one. The more _outré_ and\n      grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be\n      examined, and the very point which appears to complicate a case\n      is, when duly considered and scientifically handled, the one\n      which is most likely to elucidate it.\n\n      “Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed\n      always by Stapleton in the cab. From his knowledge of our rooms\n      and of my appearance, as well as from his general conduct, I am\n      inclined to think that Stapleton’s career of crime has been by no\n      means limited to this single Baskerville affair. It is suggestive\n      that during the last three years there have been four\n      considerable burglaries in the west country, for none of which\n      was any criminal ever arrested. The last of these, at Folkestone\n      Court, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling of\n      the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I cannot\n      doubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this\n      fashion, and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous\n      man.\n\n      “We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when\n      he got away from us so successfully, and also of his audacity in\n      sending back my own name to me through the cabman. From that\n      moment he understood that I had taken over the case in London,\n      and that therefore there was no chance for him there. He returned\n      to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet.”\n\n      “One moment!” said I. “You have, no doubt, described the sequence\n      of events correctly, but there is one point which you have left\n      unexplained. What became of the hound when its master was in\n      London?”\n\n      “I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly\n      of importance. There can be no question that Stapleton had a\n      confidant, though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in\n      his power by sharing all his plans with him. There was an old\n      manservant at Merripit House, whose name was Anthony. His\n      connection with the Stapletons can be traced for several years,\n      as far back as the school-mastering days, so that he must have\n      been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and\n      wife. This man has disappeared and has escaped from the country.\n      It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England,\n      while Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries.\n      The man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but\n      with a curious lisping accent. I have myself seen this old man\n      cross the Grimpen Mire by the path which Stapleton had marked\n      out. It is very probable, therefore, that in the absence of his\n      master it was he who cared for the hound, though he may never\n      have known the purpose for which the beast was used.\n\n      “The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they were\n      soon followed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to how I\n      stood myself at that time. It may possibly recur to your memory\n      that when I examined the paper upon which the printed words were\n      fastened I made a close inspection for the water-mark. In doing\n      so I held it within a few inches of my eyes, and was conscious of\n      a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine. There are\n      seventy-five perfumes, which it is very necessary that a criminal\n      expert should be able to distinguish from each other, and cases\n      have more than once within my own experience depended upon their\n      prompt recognition. The scent suggested the presence of a lady,\n      and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons.\n      Thus I had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the\n      criminal before ever we went to the west country.\n\n      “It was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that\n      I could not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly\n      on his guard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included,\n      and I came down secretly when I was supposed to be in London. My\n      hardships were not so great as you imagined, though such trifling\n      details must never interfere with the investigation of a case. I\n      stayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut\n      upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of\n      action. Cartwright had come down with me, and in his disguise as\n      a country boy he was of great assistance to me. I was dependent\n      upon him for food and clean linen. When I was watching Stapleton,\n      Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I was able to\n      keep my hand upon all the strings.\n\n      “I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly,\n      being forwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey.\n      They were of great service to me, and especially that one\n      incidentally truthful piece of biography of Stapleton’s. I was\n      able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew\n      at last exactly how I stood. The case had been considerably\n      complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the\n      relations between him and the Barrymores. This also you cleared\n      up in a very effective way, though I had already come to the same\n      conclusions from my own observations.\n\n      “By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a\n      complete knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case\n      which could go to a jury. Even Stapleton’s attempt upon Sir Henry\n      that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict\n      did not help us much in proving murder against our man. There\n      seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red-handed, and to\n      do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and apparently unprotected,\n      as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a severe shock to our\n      client we succeeded in completing our case and driving Stapleton\n      to his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been exposed to\n      this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case,\n      but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing\n      spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog\n      which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice. We\n      succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and\n      Dr. Mortimer assure me will be a temporary one. A long journey\n      may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered\n      nerves but also from his wounded feelings. His love for the lady\n      was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part of all this\n      black business was that he should have been deceived by her.\n\n      “It only remains to indicate the part which she had played\n      throughout. There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an\n      influence over her which may have been love or may have been\n      fear, or very possibly both, since they are by no means\n      incompatible emotions. It was, at least, absolutely effective. At\n      his command she consented to pass as his sister, though he found\n      the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her\n      the direct accessory to murder. She was ready to warn Sir Henry\n      so far as she could without implicating her husband, and again\n      and again she tried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to have\n      been capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying\n      court to the lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still\n      he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which\n      revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so\n      cleverly concealed. By encouraging the intimacy he made it\n      certain that Sir Henry would frequently come to Merripit House\n      and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he\n      desired. On the day of the crisis, however, his wife turned\n      suddenly against him. She had learned something of the death of\n      the convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the\n      outhouse on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner. She\n      taxed her husband with his intended crime, and a furious scene\n      followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a\n      rival in his love. Her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter\n      hatred, and he saw that she would betray him. He tied her up,\n      therefore, that she might have no chance of warning Sir Henry,\n      and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put down\n      the baronet’s death to the curse of his family, as they certainly\n      would do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished\n      fact and to keep silent upon what she knew. In this I fancy that\n      in any case he made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not\n      been there, his doom would none the less have been sealed. A\n      woman of Spanish blood does not condone such an injury so\n      lightly. And now, my dear Watson, without referring to my notes,\n      I cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case. I\n      do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained.”\n\n      “He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had done\n      the old uncle with his bogie hound.”\n\n      “The beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did not\n      frighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the\n      resistance which might be offered.”\n\n      “No doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton came\n      into the succession, how could he explain the fact that he, the\n      heir, had been living unannounced under another name so close to\n      the property? How could he claim it without causing suspicion and\n      inquiry?”\n\n      “It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much\n      when you expect me to solve it. The past and the present are\n      within the field of my inquiry, but what a man may do in the\n      future is a hard question to answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard her\n      husband discuss the problem on several occasions. There were\n      three possible courses. He might claim the property from South\n      America, establish his identity before the British authorities\n      there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to England at\n      all, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short\n      time that he need be in London; or, again, he might furnish an\n      accomplice with the proofs and papers, putting him in as heir,\n      and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income. We\n      cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found\n      some way out of the difficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we have\n      had some weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I think, we\n      may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels. I have a box\n      for _Les Huguenots_. Have you heard the De Reszkes? Might I\n      trouble you then to be ready in half an hour, and we can stop at\n      Marcini’s for a little dinner on the way?”\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n`\n);\n\nexport const crimeAndPunishment = new Book(\n  'Crime and Punishment',\n  `\nCRIME AND PUNISHMENT\n\nBy Fyodor Dostoevsky\n\n\nTranslated By Constance Garnett\n\n\nTRANSLATOR’S PREFACE\n\nA few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the English reader to\nunderstand his work.\n\nDostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were very hard-working\nand deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five\nchildren in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings\nin reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious\ncharacter.\n\nThough always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the\nfinal examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had\nalready begun his first work, “Poor Folk.”\n\nThis story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and\nwas received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself\ninstantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career\nseemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he\nwas arrested.\n\nThough neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky\nwas one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier\nand Proudhon. He was accused of “taking part in conversations against\nthe censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of\nknowing of the intention to set up a printing press.” Under Nicholas\nI. (that “stern and just man,” as Maurice Baring calls him) this was\nenough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months’ imprisonment\nhe was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to\nbe shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: “They snapped\nwords over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by\npersons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,\nto suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only\na few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and\nI contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to\nbid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,\nbrought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared\nus our lives.” The sentence was commuted to hard labour.\n\nOne of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and\nnever regained his sanity.\n\nThe intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on\nDostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to\naccept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing\nin his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.\nHe describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the\ncruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal\nservitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where\nhe began the “Dead House,” and some years of service in a disciplinary\nbattalion.\n\nHe had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest\nand this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he\nsuffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times\na year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was\nallowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--“Vremya,” which was\nforbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost\nhis first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet\nhe took upon himself the payment of his brother’s debts. He started\nanother journal--“The Epoch,” which within a few months was also\nprohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother’s family was\ndependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is\nsaid never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were\nmuch softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.\n\nIn June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the\nmonument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary\ndemonstrations of love and honour.\n\nA few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a\nvast multitude of mourners, who “gave the hapless man the funeral of a\nking.” He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.\n\nIn the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling\ninspired by Dostoevsky: “He was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and\nour bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than\nwe have his insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heart\nwhich we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other\ngifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and through it he\nbecame great.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCRIME AND PUNISHMENT\n\n\n\n\nPART I\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nOn an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of\nthe garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though\nin hesitation, towards K. bridge.\n\nHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His\ngarret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more\nlike a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,\ndinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time\nhe went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which\ninvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a\nsick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was\nhopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\n\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but\nfor some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,\nverging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in\nhimself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not\nonly his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the\nanxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had\ngiven up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all\ndesire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror\nfor him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her\ntrivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats\nand complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to\nlie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and\nslip out unseen.\n\nThis evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely\naware of his fears.\n\n“I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these\ntrifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm... yes, all is in a man’s\nhands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would\nbe interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new\nstep, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking\ntoo much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is\nthat I chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this\nlast month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the\nGiant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is\n_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amuse\nmyself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”\n\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle\nand the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that\nspecial Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out\nof town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man’s already\noverwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which\nare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men\nwhom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed\nthe revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest\ndisgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was,\nby the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,\nwell-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank\ninto deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness\nof mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring\nto observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the\nhabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these\nmoments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a\ntangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted\nfood.\n\nHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would\nhave been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter\nof the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have\ncreated surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number\nof establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading\nand working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the\nheart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets\nthat no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was\nsuch accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that,\nin spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least\nof all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with\nacquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked\nmeeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown\nreason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy\ndray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: “Hey there, German\nhatter” bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young\nman stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall\nround hat from Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all\ntorn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly\nfashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror\nhad overtaken him.\n\n“I knew it,” he muttered in confusion, “I thought so! That’s the worst\nof all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might\nspoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd\nand that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any\nsort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such\na hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What\nmatters is that people would remember it, and that would give them\na clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as\npossible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it’s just such\ntrifles that always ruin everything....”\n\nHe had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate\nof his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted\nthem once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no\nfaith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous\nbut daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon\nthem differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at\nhis own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard\nthis “hideous” dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he\nstill did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a\n“rehearsal” of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more\nand more violent.\n\nWith a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house\nwhich on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the\nstreet. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by\nworking people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of\nsorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.\nThere was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the\ntwo courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on\nthe building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and\nat once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the\nstaircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar\nwith it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:\nin such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.\n\n“If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that\nI were really going to do it?” he could not help asking himself as he\nreached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters\nwho were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the\nflat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his\nfamily. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this\nstaircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. “That’s a good\nthing anyway,” he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old\nwoman’s flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of\ntin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells\nthat ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now\nits peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it\nclearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained\nby now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old\nwoman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and\nnothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.\nBut, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and\nopened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which\nwas partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing\nhim in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,\nwithered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp\nlittle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared\nwith oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,\nwhich looked like a hen’s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,\nand, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy\nfur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every\ninstant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar\nexpression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.\n\n“Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,” the young man made\nhaste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more\npolite.\n\n“I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,” the\nold woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.\n\n“And here... I am again on the same errand,” Raskolnikov continued, a\nlittle disconcerted and surprised at the old woman’s mistrust. “Perhaps\nshe is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other\ntime,” he thought with an uneasy feeling.\n\nThe old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,\nand pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass\nin front of her:\n\n“Step in, my good sir.”\n\nThe little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on\nthe walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly\nlighted up at that moment by the setting sun.\n\n“So the sun will shine like this _then_ too!” flashed as it were by\nchance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned\neverything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and\nremember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The\nfurniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with\na huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a\ndressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,\nchairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow\nframes, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was\nall. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything\nwas very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;\neverything shone.\n\n“Lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust\nto be seen in the whole flat.\n\n“It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such\ncleanliness,” Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance\nat the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in\nwhich stood the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers and into which he\nhad never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\n\n“What do you want?” the old woman said severely, coming into the room\nand, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in\nthe face.\n\n“I’ve brought something to pawn here,” and he drew out of his pocket\nan old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a\nglobe; the chain was of steel.\n\n“But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day\nbefore yesterday.”\n\n“I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.”\n\n“But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell\nyour pledge at once.”\n\n“How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?”\n\n“You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely worth anything.\nI gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it\nquite new at a jeweler’s for a rouble and a half.”\n\n“Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father’s. I\nshall be getting some money soon.”\n\n“A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!”\n\n“A rouble and a half!” cried the young man.\n\n“Please yourself”--and the old woman handed him back the watch. The\nyoung man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going\naway; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere\nelse he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.\n\n“Hand it over,” he said roughly.\n\nThe old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind\nthe curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone in\nthe middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear\nher unlocking the chest of drawers.\n\n“It must be the top drawer,” he reflected. “So she carries the keys in\na pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And there’s\none key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;\nthat can’t be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some\nother chest or strong-box... that’s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always\nhave keys like that... but how degrading it all is.”\n\nThe old woman came back.\n\n“Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take\nfifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. But\nfor the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks\non the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks\naltogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the\nwatch. Here it is.”\n\n“What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!”\n\n“Just so.”\n\nThe young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at the\nold woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still\nsomething he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know\nwhat.\n\n“I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona\nIvanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it\nback from a friend...” he broke off in confusion.\n\n“Well, we will talk about it then, sir.”\n\n“Good-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with\nyou?” He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the\npassage.\n\n“What business is she of yours, my good sir?”\n\n“Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too quick.... Good-day,\nAlyona Ivanovna.”\n\nRaskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became more\nand more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two\nor three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was\nin the street he cried out, “Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and\ncan I, can I possibly.... No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!” he added\nresolutely. “And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?\nWhat filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all,\ndisgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I’ve been....”\n But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling\nof intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart\nwhile he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a\npitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to\ndo with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the\npavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling\nagainst them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next\nstreet. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern\nwhich was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.\nAt that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and\nsupporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to\nthink, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had\nnever been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a\nburning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his\nsudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little\ntable in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank\noff the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became\nclear.\n\n“All that’s nonsense,” he said hopefully, “and there is nothing in it\nall to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. Just a glass of\nbeer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,\nthe mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all\nis!”\n\nBut in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful\nas though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed\nround in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that\nmoment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also\nnot normal.\n\nThere were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunken\nmen he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and\na girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departure\nleft the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern\nwere a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so,\nsitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with\na grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and had\ndropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in\nhis sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper\npart of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some\nmeaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:\n\n   “His wife a year he fondly loved\n    His wife a--a year he--fondly loved.”\n\nOr suddenly waking up again:\n\n   “Walking along the crowded row\n    He met the one he used to know.”\n\nBut no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with\npositive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There was\nanother man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government\nclerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and\nlooking round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some agitation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nRaskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided\nsociety of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he\nfelt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking\nplace within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He\nwas so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy\nexcitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other\nworld, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the\nsurroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.\n\nThe master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently\ncame down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with\nred turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his\nperson. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,\nwith no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an\niron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was\nanother boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the\ncounter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and\nsome fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably\nclose, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such\nan atmosphere might well make a man drunk.\n\nThere are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the\nfirst moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made on\nRaskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked\nlike a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression\nafterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly\nat the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring\npersistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At\nthe other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk\nlooked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing\na shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and\nculture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to\nconverse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,\nand stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of\na yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen\nreddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very\nstrange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense\nfeeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the\nsame time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an\nold and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing\nexcept one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this\nlast trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots\nand stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he wore\nno beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin\nlooked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable\nand like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; he\nruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his\nhands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky\ntable. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and\nresolutely:\n\n“May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?\nForasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my\nexperience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not\naccustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when in\nconjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular\ncounsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. I\nmake bold to inquire--have you been in the service?”\n\n“No, I am studying,” answered the young man, somewhat surprised at\nthe grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly\naddressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for\ncompany of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his\nhabitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached\nor attempted to approach him.\n\n“A student then, or formerly a student,” cried the clerk. “Just what\nI thought! I’m a man of experience, immense experience, sir,” and he\ntapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. “You’ve been a\nstudent or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me....”\n He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside\nthe young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spoke\nfluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his\nsentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov as\ngreedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.\n\n“Honoured sir,” he began almost with solemnity, “poverty is not a vice,\nthat’s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,\nand that that’s even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a\nvice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but\nin beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human\nsociety with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as\nhumiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary\nI am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!\nHonoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and\nmy wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me\nto ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent\na night on a hay barge, on the Neva?”\n\n“No, I have not happened to,” answered Raskolnikov. “What do you mean?”\n\n“Well, I’ve just come from one and it’s the fifth night I’ve slept\nso....” He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were in\nfact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite\nprobable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.\nHis hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black\nnails.\n\nHis conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. The\nboys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from the\nupper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the “funny fellow”\n and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.\nEvidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most\nlikely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of\nfrequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in\nthe tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and\nespecially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order\nat home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify\nthemselves and even if possible obtain consideration.\n\n“Funny fellow!” pronounced the innkeeper. “And why don’t you work, why\naren’t you at your duty, if you are in the service?”\n\n“Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,” Marmeladov went on, addressing\nhimself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put\nthat question to him. “Why am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache\nto think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov\nbeat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn’t I suffer?\nExcuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, to\npetition hopelessly for a loan?”\n\n“Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?”\n\n“Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you\nwill get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positive\ncertainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will\non no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?\nFor he knows of course that I shan’t pay it back. From compassion? But\nMr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day\nthat compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that’s\nwhat is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, I\nask you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand that\nhe won’t, I set off to him and...”\n\n“Why do you go?” put in Raskolnikov.\n\n“Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man must\nhave somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely must\ngo somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket,\nthen I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport),” he added\nin parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.\n“No matter, sir, no matter!” he went on hurriedly and with apparent\ncomposure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the\ninnkeeper smiled--“No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of\ntheir heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all\nthat is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, but\nwith humility. So be it! So be it! ‘Behold the man!’ Excuse me, young\nman, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not\n_can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?”\n\nThe young man did not answer a word.\n\n“Well,” the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity,\nafter waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. “Well, so be\nit, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, but\nKaterina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer’s\ndaughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a\nnoble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh,\nif only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man\nought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But Katerina\nIvanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, although\nI realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for\nI repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man,” he\ndeclared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--“but, my\nGod, if she would but once.... But no, no! It’s all in vain and it’s no\nuse talking! No use talking! For more than once, my wish did come true\nand more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a\nbeast by nature!”\n\n“Rather!” assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fist\nresolutely on the table.\n\n“Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very\nstockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the\norder of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!\nHer mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own\nproperty, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this\nwinter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have three\nlittle children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till\nnight; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she’s\nbeen used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she has\na tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don’t feel it?\nAnd the more I drink the more I feel it. That’s why I drink too. I try\nto find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer\ntwice as much!” And as though in despair he laid his head down on the\ntable.\n\n“Young man,” he went on, raising his head again, “in your face I seem to\nread some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was why\nI addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I\ndo not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,\nwho indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man\nof feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a\nhigh-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she\ndanced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for\nwhich she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.\nThe medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but the\ncertificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed\nit to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad terms\nwith the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past\nhonours and of the happy days that are gone. I don’t condemn her for\nit, I don’t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of\nthe past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady\nof spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has\nnothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be treated\nwith disrespect. That’s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov’s\nrudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to\nher bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was\na widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the\nother. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and\nran away with him from her father’s house. She was exceedingly fond of\nher husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he\ndied. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of\nwhich I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of\nhim with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad\nthat, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having\nonce been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children in\na wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she\nwas left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups\nand downs of all sort, I don’t feel equal to describing it even. Her\nrelations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessively\nproud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a\nwidower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered\nher my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can\njudge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education\nand culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my\nwife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she\nmarried me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do you\nunderstand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No,\nthat you don’t understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performed\nmy duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this” (he\ntapped the jug with his finger), “for I have feelings. But even so, I\ncould not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no\nfault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch\nit!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at\nlast after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent\ncapital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained a\nsituation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This\ntime it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come\nout.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel’s;\nand what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.\nThere are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt and\ndisorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter by\nmy first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with\nfrom her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won’t speak of. For,\nthough Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited\nlady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But it’s no use going over\nthat! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make an\neffort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal\nhistory, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we\nhad no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not\neven those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at\nCyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read\nother books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great\ninterest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes’ Physiology--do\nyou know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that’s the\nwhole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honoured\nsir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that\na respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen\nfarthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special\ntalent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And what’s\nmore, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of\nhim?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she\nmade him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the\npretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were\nput in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And Katerina\nIvanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed\nred, as they always are in that disease: ‘Here you live with us,’ says\nshe, ‘you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.’\nAnd much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the\nlittle ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well, what of\nit! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle\ncreature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin\nlittle face). She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing\nlike that?’ And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very\nwell known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her\nthrough the landlady. ‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,\n‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!’ But don’t blame\nher, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t blame her! She was not herself\nwhen she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying\nof the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything\nelse.... For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when children\ncry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six o’clock\nI saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the\nroom and about nine o’clock she came back. She walked straight up to\nKaterina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her\nin silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she\nsimply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,\nmade of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down\non the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her\nbody kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....\nAnd then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence\ngo up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the evening\nkissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell\nasleep in each other’s arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay\ndrunk.”\n\nMarmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. Then he\nhurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat.\n\n“Since then, sir,” he went on after a brief pause--“Since then, owing\nto an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by\nevil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a\nleading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of\nrespect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take\na yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with\nus. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though\nshe had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...\nhm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’s\naccount. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of\na sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, ‘can a highly educated\nman like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?’ And Katerina\nIvanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that’s\nhow it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she\ncomforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room\nat the Kapernaumovs’ the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is\na lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft\npalates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one\nroom, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very poor\npeople and all with cleft palates... yes. Then I got up in the morning,\nand put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his\nexcellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you\nknow him? No? Well, then, it’s a man of God you don’t know. He is wax...\nwax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes were\ndim when he heard my story. ‘Marmeladov, once already you have\ndeceived my expectations... I’ll take you once more on my own\nresponsibility’--that’s what he said, ‘remember,’ he said, ‘and now you\ncan go.’ I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in reality\nhe would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of\nmodern political and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when I\nannounced that I’d been taken back into the service and should receive a\nsalary, heavens, what a to-do there was!...”\n\nMarmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At that moment a whole\nparty of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds\nof a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven\nsinging “The Hamlet” were heard in the entry. The room was filled with\nnoise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.\nMarmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.\nHe appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more\ndrunk, he became more and more talkative. The recollection of his\nrecent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was\npositively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. Raskolnikov\nlistened attentively.\n\n“That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna\nand Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the\nkingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but\nabuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. ‘Semyon\nZaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!’\nThey made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! They\nbegan to get real cream for me, do you hear that? And how they managed\nto get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fifty\ncopecks, I can’t guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent,\na uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and\na half. The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina\nIvanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with\nhorse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not any\ndresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going\non a visit; and not that she’d anything to do it with, she smartened\nherself up with nothing at all, she’d done her hair nicely, put on a\nclean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different\nperson, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling,\nhad only helped with money ‘for the time,’ she said, ‘it won’t do for me\nto come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.’ Do\nyou hear, do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you\nthink: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with\nour landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not\nresist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting,\nwhispering together. ‘Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,\nnow, and receiving a salary,’ says she, ‘and he went himself to his\nexcellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the\nothers wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into\nhis study.’ Do you hear, do you hear? ‘To be sure,’ says he, ‘Semyon\nZaharovitch, remembering your past services,’ says he, ‘and in spite\nof your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and\nsince moreover we’ve got on badly without you,’ (do you hear, do you\nhear;) ‘and so,’ says he, ‘I rely now on your word as a gentleman.’ And\nall that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not\nsimply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it\nall herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she\ndoes! And I don’t blame her for it, no, I don’t blame her!... Six days\nago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles\nforty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: ‘poppet,’ said she,\n‘my little poppet.’ And when we were by ourselves, you understand?\nYou would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a\nhusband, would you?... Well, she pinched my cheek, ‘my little poppet,’\nsaid she.”\n\nMarmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began\nto twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern, the degraded\nappearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of\nspirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered\nhis listener. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.\nHe felt vexed that he had come here.\n\n“Honoured sir, honoured sir,” cried Marmeladov recovering himself--“Oh,\nsir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to\nothers, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the\ntrivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.\nFor I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life\nand the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would\narrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should\ngive her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour\nand restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....\nQuite excusable, sir. Well, then, sir” (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort\nof start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) “well, on\nthe very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five\ndays ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,\nI stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was\nleft of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look\nat me, all of you! It’s the fifth day since I left home, and they are\nlooking for me there and it’s the end of my employment, and my uniform\nis lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I exchanged it for the\ngarments I have on... and it’s the end of everything!”\n\nMarmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed\nhis eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. But a minute\nlater his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and\naffectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:\n\n“This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!\nHe-he-he!”\n\n“You don’t say she gave it to you?” cried one of the new-comers; he\nshouted the words and went off into a guffaw.\n\n“This very quart was bought with her money,” Marmeladov declared,\naddressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. “Thirty copecks she gave\nme with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She said\nnothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but up\nyonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don’t blame them,\nthey don’t blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don’t\nblame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What do\nyou think, my dear sir? For now she’s got to keep up her appearance. It\ncosts money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do you\nunderstand? And there’s pomatum, too, you see, she must have things;\npetticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her\nfoot when she has to step over a puddle. Do you understand, sir, do you\nunderstand what all that smartness means? And here I, her own father,\nhere I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinking\nit! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man like\nme, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorry\nor not? He-he-he!”\n\nHe would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. The pot was\nempty.\n\n“What are you to be pitied for?” shouted the tavern-keeper who was again\nnear them.\n\nShouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oaths\ncame from those who were listening and also from those who had heard\nnothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged\ngovernment clerk.\n\n“To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?” Marmeladov suddenly declaimed,\nstanding up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only\nwaiting for that question.\n\n“Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there’s nothing to pity me for! I\nought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! Crucify me,\noh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be\ncrucified, for it’s not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...\nDo you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been\nsweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and\ntribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity\nus Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all\nthings, He is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that day\nand He will ask: ‘Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross,\nconsumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where is\nthe daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father,\nundismayed by his beastliness?’ And He will say, ‘Come to me! I have\nalready forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins\nwhich are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....’ And he\nwill forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it... I felt it in my\nheart when I was with her just now! And He will judge and will forgive\nall, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He has\ndone with all of them, then He will summon us. ‘You too come forth,’\nHe will say, ‘Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come\nforth, ye children of shame!’ And we shall all come forth, without shame\nand shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, ‘Ye are swine, made\nin the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!’ And the\nwise ones and those of understanding will say, ‘Oh Lord, why dost Thou\nreceive these men?’ And He will say, ‘This is why I receive them, oh ye\nwise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one\nof them believed himself to be worthy of this.’ And He will hold out His\nhands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...\nand we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... and\nall will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....\nLord, Thy kingdom come!” And he sank down on the bench exhausted, and\nhelpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings\nand plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression;\nthere was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard\nagain.\n\n“That’s his notion!”\n\n“Talked himself silly!”\n\n“A fine clerk he is!”\n\nAnd so on, and so on.\n\n“Let us go, sir,” said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head and\naddressing Raskolnikov--“come along with me... Kozel’s house, looking\ninto the yard. I’m going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did.”\n\nRaskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to\nhelp him. Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech\nand leaned heavily on the young man. They had two or three hundred\npaces to go. The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and\nconfusion as they drew nearer the house.\n\n“It’s not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now,” he muttered in\nagitation--“and that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hair\nmatter! Bother my hair! That’s what I say! Indeed it will be better if\nshe does begin pulling it, that’s not what I am afraid of... it’s her\neyes I am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too,\nfrightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how people\nin that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened of\nthe children’s crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food...\nI don’t know what’s happened! I don’t know! But blows I am not afraid\nof.... Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an\nenjoyment. In fact I can’t get on without it.... It’s better so. Let\nher strike me, it relieves her heart... it’s better so... There is the\nhouse. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do.\nLead the way!”\n\nThey went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircase\ngot darker and darker as they went up. It was nearly eleven o’clock\nand although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was\nquite dark at the top of the stairs.\n\nA grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. A very\npoor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;\nthe whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder,\nlittered up with rags of all sorts, especially children’s garments.\nAcross the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it\nprobably was the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs\nand a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which\nstood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. At the edge\nof the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It\nappeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room,\nbut their room was practically a passage. The door leading to the other\nrooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel’s flat was\ndivided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter\nwithin. People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Words\nof the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.\n\nRaskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall,\nslim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown\nhair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down\nin her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips\nwere parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyes\nglittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. And\nthat consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the\ncandle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed to\nRaskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for\nMarmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.\nShe seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The room\nwas close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the\nstaircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner\nrooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not\nclose the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting\ncurled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year older\nstood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a\nbeating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin,\nwearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung\nover her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.\nHer arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother’s neck. She was\ntrying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she\ncould to keep him from whimpering again. At the same time her large\ndark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened\nface, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter the\ndoor, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov\nin front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently\nfacing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what\nhe had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going into\nthe next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there. Taking no\nfurther notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it\nand uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the\ndoorway.\n\n“Ah!” she cried out in a frenzy, “he has come back! The criminal! the\nmonster!... And where is the money? What’s in your pocket, show me! And\nyour clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is the\nmoney! Speak!”\n\nAnd she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obediently\nheld up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.\n\n“Where is the money?” she cried--“Mercy on us, can he have drunk it all?\nThere were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!” and in a fury\nshe seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladov\nseconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.\n\n“And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is a\npositive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,” he called out, shaken to and\nfro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.\nThe child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in the\ncorner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed\nto his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was\nshaking like a leaf.\n\n“He’s drunk it! he’s drunk it all,” the poor woman screamed in\ndespair--“and his clothes are gone! And they are hungry, hungry!”--and\nwringing her hands she pointed to the children. “Oh, accursed life!\nAnd you, are you not ashamed?”--she pounced all at once upon\nRaskolnikov--“from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have\nbeen drinking with him, too! Go away!”\n\nThe young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner door\nwas thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarse\nlaughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust\nthemselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in\ndressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of\nthem with cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted, when\nMarmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation\nto him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill\noutcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her\nway amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and\nfor the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her\nwith coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out,\nRaskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the\ncoppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to\nlay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the stairs, he changed\nhis mind and would have gone back.\n\n“What a stupid thing I’ve done,” he thought to himself, “they have Sonia\nand I want it myself.” But reflecting that it would be impossible to\ntake it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he\ndismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.\n“Sonia wants pomatum too,” he said as he walked along the street, and he\nlaughed malignantly--“such smartness costs money.... Hm! And maybe Sonia\nherself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting\nbig game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust\nto-morrow except for my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they’ve dug\nthere! And they’re making the most of it! Yes, they are making the most\nof it! They’ve wept over it and grown used to it. Man grows used to\neverything, the scoundrel!”\n\nHe sank into thought.\n\n“And what if I am wrong,” he cried suddenly after a moment’s thought.\n“What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the\nwhole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial\nterrors and there are no barriers and it’s all as it should be.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nHe waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his sleep had not\nrefreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked\nwith hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six\npaces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty\nyellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man\nof more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment\nthat he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was in\nkeeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a\npainted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;\nthe dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long\nuntouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and\nhalf the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but\nwas now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep\non it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old\nstudent’s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he\nheaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster. A\nlittle table stood in front of the sofa.\n\nIt would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to\nRaskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.\nHe had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell,\nand even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked\nsometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. He was\nin the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated\nupon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending\nhim in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her,\nthough he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant,\nwas rather pleased at the lodger’s mood and had entirely given up\nsweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into\nhis room with a broom. She waked him up that day.\n\n“Get up, why are you asleep?” she called to him. “It’s past nine, I have\nbrought you some tea; will you have a cup? I should think you’re fairly\nstarving?”\n\nRaskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised Nastasya.\n\n“From the landlady, eh?” he asked, slowly and with a sickly face sitting\nup on the sofa.\n\n“From the landlady, indeed!”\n\nShe set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and\nlaid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it.\n\n“Here, Nastasya, take it please,” he said, fumbling in his pocket (for\nhe had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--“run\nand buy me a loaf. And get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at the\npork-butcher’s.”\n\n“The loaf I’ll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn’t you rather have\nsome cabbage soup instead of sausage? It’s capital soup, yesterday’s. I\nsaved it for you yesterday, but you came in late. It’s fine soup.”\n\nWhen the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasya\nsat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting. She was a country\npeasant-woman and a very talkative one.\n\n“Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you,” she\nsaid.\n\nHe scowled.\n\n“To the police? What does she want?”\n\n“You don’t pay her money and you won’t turn out of the room. That’s what\nshe wants, to be sure.”\n\n“The devil, that’s the last straw,” he muttered, grinding his teeth,\n“no, that would not suit me... just now. She is a fool,” he added aloud.\n“I’ll go and talk to her to-day.”\n\n“Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am. But why, if you are so\nclever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it? One\ntime you used to go out, you say, to teach children. But why is it you\ndo nothing now?”\n\n“I am doing...” Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly.\n\n“What are you doing?”\n\n“Work...”\n\n“What sort of work?”\n\n“I am thinking,” he answered seriously after a pause.\n\nNastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter. She was given to laughter\nand when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering and\nshaking all over till she felt ill.\n\n“And have you made much money by your thinking?” she managed to\narticulate at last.\n\n“One can’t go out to give lessons without boots. And I’m sick of it.”\n\n“Don’t quarrel with your bread and butter.”\n\n“They pay so little for lessons. What’s the use of a few coppers?” he\nanswered, reluctantly, as though replying to his own thought.\n\n“And you want to get a fortune all at once?”\n\nHe looked at her strangely.\n\n“Yes, I want a fortune,” he answered firmly, after a brief pause.\n\n“Don’t be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me! Shall I get you the\nloaf or not?”\n\n“As you please.”\n\n“Ah, I forgot! A letter came for you yesterday when you were out.”\n\n“A letter? for me! from whom?”\n\n“I can’t say. I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it. Will\nyou pay me back?”\n\n“Then bring it to me, for God’s sake, bring it,” cried Raskolnikov\ngreatly excited--“good God!”\n\nA minute later the letter was brought him. That was it: from his mother,\nfrom the province of R----. He turned pale when he took it. It was a\nlong while since he had received a letter, but another feeling also\nsuddenly stabbed his heart.\n\n“Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness’ sake; here are your three\ncopecks, but for goodness’ sake, make haste and go!”\n\nThe letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her\npresence; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter. When Nastasya\nhad gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he\ngazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear\nand familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.\nHe delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. At last he opened it;\nit was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheets\nof note paper were covered with very small handwriting.\n\n“My dear Rodya,” wrote his mother--“it’s two months since I last had a\ntalk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me\nawake at night, thinking. But I am sure you will not blame me for my\ninevitable silence. You know how I love you; you are all we have to look\nto, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. What a\ngrief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university\nsome months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had\nlost your lessons and your other work! How could I help you out of my\nhundred and twenty roubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sent\nyou four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension,\nfrom Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. He is a\nkind-hearted man and was a friend of your father’s too. But having given\nhim the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was\npaid off and that is only just done, so that I’ve been unable to send\nyou anything all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I shall\nbe able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate\nourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. In\nthe first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister\nhas been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be\nseparated in the future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will\ntell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything\nhas happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you. When you\nwrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great\ndeal to put up with in the Svidrigaïlovs’ house, when you wrote that\nand asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to\nyou? If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have\nthrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all\nthe way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not\nlet your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I\ndo? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. What\nmade it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles\nin advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on\ncondition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it\nwas impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.\nThis sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took\nchiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly\nthen and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then,\nwriting that this money came from Dounia’s savings, but that was not\nso, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have\nsuddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves\nyou and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated\nher very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at\ntable.... But I don’t want to go into all those painful details, so as\nnot to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spite\nof the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s\nwife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,\nespecially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov, relapsing into his old regimental\nhabits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think it\nwas all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had\nconceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed\nit under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and\nhorrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and\nhis being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.\nAnd possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide\nthe truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the face\nto make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of\ninducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her\nto another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she went\nthrough! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on\naccount of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa\nPetrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia\nwould have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would\nhave meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been\ninevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could\nnot hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know\nDounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she\nhas. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases\nshe has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write\nto me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were\nconstantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa\nPetrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the\ngarden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw\nthe blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful\nscene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna\nwent so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was\nshouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should\nbe packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, into which they\nflung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without\nfolding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,\nand Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an\nopen cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer\ncould I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and\nwhat could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to\nyou the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified\nand indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin\nyourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter\nwith trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For a\nwhole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came\nto such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account\nof the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about\nus. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the\nstreet, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to\ninsult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,\nso that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set\ngoing by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at\nher in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that\nmonth she was continually coming into the town, and as she is\nrather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and\nparticularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not\nat all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in\nthe town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but\nDounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how\nshe endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is\nan angel! But by God’s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.\nSvidrigaïlov returned to his senses and repented and, probably\nfeeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and\nunmistakable proof of Dounia’s innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia\nhad been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna\ncame upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.\nSvidrigaïlov’s hands after her departure, she had written to refuse\npersonal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating\nher. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation\nfor the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding\nhim that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how\ninfamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,\nunhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and\ntouchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot\nread it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,\ncleared Dounia’s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more\nthan Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case\nwith servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and ‘again\ncrushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of\nDounia’s innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight\nto the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give\nher strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she\ncame straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept\nbitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to\nforgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to all\nthe houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in\nthe most flattering terms Dounia’s innocence and the nobility of\nher feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to\neveryone the letter in Dounia’s own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov and\neven allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was\nsuperfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about\nthe whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence\nhaving been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, so\nthat in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone\nknew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the\nletter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading\nof it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their\nown houses and in other people’s. In my opinion a great deal, a very\ngreat deal of all this was unnecessary; but that’s Marfa Petrovna’s\ncharacter. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia’s\nreputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible\ndisgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really\nbegan to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too\nharshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,\nbut she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked\nrespect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may\nsay, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,\nthat Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry\nhim. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been\narranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved\nwith me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we\ncould not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you\ncould not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This\nwas how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr\nPetrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who\nhas been very active in bringing the match about. It began with his\nexpressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He was\nproperly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent\nus a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a\nspeedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry\nto get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,\nof course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly\nand unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is a\nwell-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government\nand has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years\nold, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be\nthought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and\npresentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.\nBut possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.\nAnd beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will\ndo, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if\nthere is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you this\nwarning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression\nupon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be\ndeliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,\nwhich are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr\nPetrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.\nAt his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but\nstill he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions ‘of our\nmost rising generation’ and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He\nsaid a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be\nlistened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very\nlittle of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man\nof great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know\nyour sister’s character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and\ngenerous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.\nOf course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but\nDounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make\nit her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her\nhappiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it\nmust be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he\nis a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that\nhis own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with\nhim. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even\ncertain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in\nthe happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she\nrelies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and\nthat she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future\nrelationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,\nfor instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come\nfrom his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For\ninstance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia’s consent,\nin the course of conversation, he declared that before making\nDounia’s acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of\ngood reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced\npoverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his\nwife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her\nbenefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely\nthan I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only\nremember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,\nbut slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards\nto correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike\nme as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was\nvexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,’ and that, of course, is\nperfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up\nher mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was\nwalking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before\nthe ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me\nthat she had decided.\n\n“I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for\nPetersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open\na legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil\nand commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important\ncase. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before\nthe Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in\nevery way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day\nyou could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that\nyour future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to\npass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a\nprovidential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even\nventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.\nHe was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not\nget on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to\na relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the\nduties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then\nhe expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave\nyou time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, but\nDounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever\nfor the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for\nyour becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr\nPetrovitch’s business, which might well be, seeing that you are a\nstudent of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share\nall her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of\nrealising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch’s evasiveness, very\nnatural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly\npersuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her\nfuture husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are careful\nnot to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,\nespecially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and might\ntake this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor\nhas either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have\nof his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken\nof it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,\nlater on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of\nhimself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since\nyou may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and\nreceive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your\nown work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree\nwith her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that\nis, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when\nyou first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about\nyou, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing\nhim close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own\nopinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my precious\nRodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr\nPetrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,\nfancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with\nthem, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous and\ndelicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter\nfor the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is\nsimply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I have\nnoticed more than once in my life that husbands don’t quite get on with\ntheir mothers-in-law, and I don’t want to be the least bit in anyone’s\nway, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so\nlong as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and\nDounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most\njoyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:\nknow then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a\nvery short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of\nalmost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to\nset off for Petersburg, exactly when I don’t know, but very, very soon,\npossibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us\nknow when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his\nown arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,\neven before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is\ntoo soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shall\npress you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought\nof seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry\nPyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writing\nanything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,\nso much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for\na few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting\nherself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But\nalthough we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much\nmoney as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Dounia\nis to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know\nthat Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles\non the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send\nyou twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I am\nuneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has\nbeen so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that\nis to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big\ntrunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we\nmust reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we\ncan’t be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. But\nwe have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see\nthat the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from\nus to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we\nknow, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel\nquite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to send\nto you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have covered\ntwo sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole\nhistory, but so many events have happened! And now, my precious Rodya,\nI embrace you and send you a mother’s blessing till we meet. Love Dounia\nyour sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she\nloves you beyond everything, more than herself. She is an angel and you,\nRodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation. If\nonly you are happy, we shall be happy. Do you still say your prayers,\nRodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer? I am\nafraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of\ninfidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you. Remember,\ndear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you used\nto lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those\ndays. Good-bye, till we meet then--I embrace you warmly, warmly, with\nmany kisses.\n\n“Yours till death,\n\n“PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.”\n\n\nAlmost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov’s face was\nwet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted\nand a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips. He laid his\nhead down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long\ntime. His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil.\nAt last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was\nlike a cupboard or a box. His eyes and his mind craved for space. He\ntook up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meeting\nanyone; he had forgotten his dread. He turned in the direction of the\nVassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though\nhastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, without\nnoticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the\nastonishment of the passers-by. Many of them took him to be drunk.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nHis mother’s letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chief\nfact in it, he had felt not one moment’s hesitation, even whilst he was\nreading the letter. The essential question was settled, and irrevocably\nsettled, in his mind: “Never such a marriage while I am alive and\nMr. Luzhin be damned!” “The thing is perfectly clear,” he muttered\nto himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his\ndecision. “No, mother, no, Dounia, you won’t deceive me! and then they\napologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without\nme! I dare say! They imagine it is arranged now and can’t be broken\noff; but we will see whether it can or not! A magnificent excuse:\n‘Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in\npost-haste, almost by express.’ No, Dounia, I see it all and I know what\nyou want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, when\nyou walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before\nthe Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother’s bedroom. Bitter is\nthe ascent to Golgotha.... Hm... so it is finally settled; you have\ndetermined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one\nwho has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune, that is so much\nmore solid and impressive), a man who holds two government posts and who\nshares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and\nwho _seems_ to be kind, as Dounia herself observes. That _seems_ beats\neverything! And that very Dounia for that very ‘_seems_’ is marrying\nhim! Splendid! splendid!\n\n“... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about ‘our\nmost rising generation’? Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea\nof prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them!\nI should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one\nanother that day and night and all this time since? Was it all put into\n_words_, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart\nand in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and\nbetter not to speak of it. Most likely it was partly like that, from\nmother’s letter it’s evident: he struck her as rude _a little_, and\nmother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she was\nsure to be vexed and ‘answered her angrily.’ I should think so! Who\nwould not be angered when it was quite clear without any naïve questions\nand when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it. And why\ndoes she write to me, ‘love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than\nherself’? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter\nto her son? ‘You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.’ Oh,\nmother!”\n\nHis bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened to\nmeet Mr. Luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him.\n\n“Hm... yes, that’s true,” he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas that\nchased each other in his brain, “it is true that ‘it needs time and care\nto get to know a man,’ but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin. The\nchief thing is he is ‘a man of business and _seems_ kind,’ that was\nsomething, wasn’t it, to send the bags and big box for them! A kind man,\nno doubt after that! But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a\npeasant’s cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven in\nit). No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can ‘travel very\ncomfortably, third class,’ for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. One\nmust cut one’s coat according to one’s cloth, but what about you, Mr.\nLuzhin? She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother has\nto raise money on her pension for the journey. To be sure it’s a matter\nof business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and\nexpenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. The\nbusiness man has got the better of them, too. The luggage will cost less\nthan their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that they\ndon’t both see all that, or is it that they don’t want to see? And\nthey are pleased, pleased! And to think that this is only the first\nblossoming, and that the real fruits are to come! But what really\nmatters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the _tone_\nof the whole thing. For that will be the tone after marriage, it’s a\nforetaste of it. And mother too, why should she be so lavish? What will\nshe have by the time she gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles or\ntwo ‘paper ones’ as _she_ says.... that old woman... hm. What does\nshe expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? She has her reasons\nalready for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after the\nmarriage, even for the first few months. The good man has no doubt let\nslip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: ‘I\nshall refuse,’ says she. On whom is she reckoning then? Is she counting\non what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when\nAfanasy Ivanovitch’s debt is paid? She knits woollen shawls and\nembroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes. And all her shawls don’t add\nmore than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I know\nthat. So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin’s\ngenerosity; ‘he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.’\nYou may wait a long time for that! That’s how it always is with these\nSchilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swan\nwith them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will see\nnothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side of\nthe picture, yet they won’t face the truth till they are forced to; the\nvery thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with\nboth hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool’s\ncap on them with his own hands. I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin\nhas any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in his buttonhole and\nthat he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants.\nHe will be sure to have it for his wedding, too! Enough of him, confound\nhim!\n\n“Well,... mother I don’t wonder at, it’s like her, God bless her, but\nhow could Dounia? Dounia darling, as though I did not know you! You were\nnearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then. Mother writes\nthat ‘Dounia can put up with a great deal.’ I know that very well. I\nknew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a half\nyears I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that ‘Dounia\ncan put up with a great deal.’ If she could put up with Mr. Svidrigaïlov\nand all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal. And\nnow mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up\nwith Mr. Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority of\nwives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband’s\nbounty--who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview. Granted\nthat he ‘let it slip,’ though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it\nwas not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon as\npossible) but Dounia, Dounia? She understands the man, of course, but\nshe will have to live with the man. Why! she’d live on black bread\nand water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moral\nfreedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein,\nmuch less Mr. Luzhin’s money. No, Dounia was not that sort when I knew\nher and... she is still the same, of course! Yes, there’s no denying,\nthe Svidrigaïlovs are a bitter pill! It’s a bitter thing to spend one’s\nlife a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I know\nshe would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German\nmaster than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity, by binding herself\nfor ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has\nnothing in common--for her own advantage. And if Mr. Luzhin had been of\nunalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented to\nbecome his legal concubine. Why is she consenting then? What’s the\npoint of it? What’s the answer? It’s clear enough: for herself, for her\ncomfort, to save her life she would not sell herself, but for someone\nelse she is doing it! For one she loves, for one she adores, she will\nsell herself! That’s what it all amounts to; for her brother, for her\nmother, she will sell herself! She will sell everything! In such cases,\n‘we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,’ freedom, peace, conscience\neven, all, all are brought into the market. Let my life go, if only my\ndear ones may be happy! More than that, we become casuists, we learn\nto be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we can\npersuade ourselves that it is one’s duty for a good object. That’s just\nlike us, it’s as clear as daylight. It’s clear that Rodion Romanovitch\nRaskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else. Oh,\nyes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the university, make him\na partner in the office, make his whole future secure; perhaps he may\neven be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end his\nlife a famous man! But my mother? It’s all Rodya, precious Rodya, her\nfirst born! For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter! Oh,\nloving, over-partial hearts! Why, for his sake we would not shrink even\nfrom Sonia’s fate. Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so long\nas the world lasts. Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both\nof you? Is it right? Can you bear it? Is it any use? Is there sense in\nit? And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia’s life is no worse than life with\nMr. Luzhin. ‘There can be no question of love,’ mother writes. And what\nif there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion,\ncontempt, repulsion, what then? So you will have to ‘keep up your\nappearance,’ too. Is not that so? Do you understand what that smartness\nmeans? Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same\nthing as Sonia’s and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case,\nDounia, it’s a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it’s\nsimply a question of starvation. It has to be paid for, it has to be\npaid for, Dounia, this smartness. And what if it’s more than you can\nbear afterwards, if you regret it? The bitterness, the misery, the\ncurses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a Marfa\nPetrovna. And how will your mother feel then? Even now she is uneasy,\nshe is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly? And I? Yes,\nindeed, what have you taken me for? I won’t have your sacrifice, Dounia,\nI won’t have it, mother! It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it\nshall not, it shall not! I won’t accept it!”\n\nHe suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still.\n\n“It shall not be? But what are you going to do to prevent it? You’ll\nforbid it? And what right have you? What can you promise them on your\nside to give you such a right? Your whole life, your whole future, you\nwill devote to them _when you have finished your studies and obtained a\npost_? Yes, we have heard all that before, and that’s all _words_, but\nnow? Now something must be done, now, do you understand that? And\nwhat are you doing now? You are living upon them. They borrow on their\nhundred roubles pension. They borrow from the Svidrigaïlovs. How are\nyou going to save them from Svidrigaïlovs, from Afanasy Ivanovitch\nVahrushin, oh, future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives for\nthem? In another ten years? In another ten years, mother will be blind\nwith knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too. She will be worn to a\nshadow with fasting; and my sister? Imagine for a moment what may have\nbecome of your sister in ten years? What may happen to her during those\nten years? Can you fancy?”\n\nSo he tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, and\nfinding a kind of enjoyment in it. And yet all these questions were not\nnew ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches. It was\nlong since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart. Long, long\nago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and\ngathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had taken\nthe form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which tortured\nhis heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer. Now his\nmother’s letter had burst on him like a thunderclap. It was clear\nthat he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved\nquestions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do it\nquickly. Anyway he must decide on something, or else...\n\n“Or throw up life altogether!” he cried suddenly, in a frenzy--“accept\none’s lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything in\noneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!”\n\n“Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have\nabsolutely nowhere to turn?” Marmeladov’s question came suddenly into\nhis mind, “for every man must have somewhere to turn....”\n\nHe gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had yesterday,\nslipped back into his mind. But he did not start at the thought\nrecurring to him, for he knew, he had _felt beforehand_, that it must\ncome back, he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterday’s\nthought. The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, the\nthought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all,\nit had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly\nbecame aware of this himself.... He felt a hammering in his head, and\nthere was a darkness before his eyes.\n\nHe looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something. He wanted\nto sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K----\nBoulevard. There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him. He\nwalked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little\nadventure which absorbed all his attention. Looking for the seat, he had\nnoticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at first\nhe took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his\npath. It had happened to him many times going home not to notice the\nroad by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that. But\nthere was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front\nof him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at first\nreluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more\nintently. He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so\nstrange about the woman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girl\nquite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with\nno parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. She had\non a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not\nproperly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the\nwaist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief was\nflung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side. The girl was\nwalking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. She\ndrew Raskolnikov’s whole attention at last. He overtook the girl at the\nseat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner;\nshe let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,\napparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he saw at once\nthat she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. He\ncould hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him the\nface of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than\nfifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking\nand, as it were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she was\ndoing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and\nshowed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.\n\nRaskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her,\nand stood facing her in perplexity. This boulevard was never much\nfrequented; and now, at two o’clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite\ndeserted. And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen\npaces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. He,\ntoo, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object\nof his own. He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and had\nfollowed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. He looked angrily at\nhim, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding\nhis time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. His\nintentions were unmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set\nman, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and\nmoustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult\nthis fat dandy in some way. He left the girl for a moment and walked\ntowards the gentleman.\n\n“Hey! You Svidrigaïlov! What do you want here?” he shouted, clenching\nhis fists and laughing, spluttering with rage.\n\n“What do you mean?” the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughty\nastonishment.\n\n“Get away, that’s what I mean.”\n\n“How dare you, you low fellow!”\n\nHe raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, without\nreflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like\nhimself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a\npolice constable stood between them.\n\n“That’s enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. What\ndo you want? Who are you?” he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing his\nrags.\n\nRaskolnikov looked at him intently. He had a straight-forward, sensible,\nsoldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers.\n\n“You are just the man I want,” Raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm.\n“I am a student, Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too,” he\nadded, addressing the gentleman, “come along, I have something to show\nyou.”\n\nAnd taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat.\n\n“Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard.\nThere is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like a\nprofessional. It’s more likely she has been given drink and deceived\nsomewhere... for the first time... you understand? and they’ve put her\nout into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, and\nthe way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has\nnot dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man’s hands;\nthat’s evident. And now look there: I don’t know that dandy with whom I\nwas going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen\nher on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now\nhe is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she\nis in this state... that’s certain, believe me, I am not wrong. I saw\nhim myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he\nis just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, and\nis standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... Think how can we\nkeep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?”\n\nThe policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman was easy to\nunderstand, he turned to consider the girl. The policeman bent over to\nexamine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion.\n\n“Ah, what a pity!” he said, shaking his head--“why, she is quite a\nchild! She has been deceived, you can see that at once. Listen, lady,”\n he began addressing her, “where do you live?” The girl opened her weary\nand sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her\nhand.\n\n“Here,” said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty\ncopecks, “here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address. The\nonly thing is to find out her address!”\n\n“Missy, missy!” the policeman began again, taking the money. “I’ll fetch\nyou a cab and take you home myself. Where shall I take you, eh? Where do\nyou live?”\n\n“Go away! They won’t let me alone,” the girl muttered, and once more\nwaved her hand.\n\n“Ach, ach, how shocking! It’s shameful, missy, it’s a shame!” He shook\nhis head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant.\n\n“It’s a difficult job,” the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he\ndid so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance. He, too, must have\nseemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!\n\n“Did you meet her far from here?” he asked him.\n\n“I tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, in\nthe boulevard. She only just reached the seat and sank down on it.”\n\n“Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God have\nmercy on us! An innocent creature like that, drunk already! She has been\ndeceived, that’s a sure thing. See how her dress has been torn too....\nAh, the vice one sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs to\ngentlefolk too, poor ones maybe.... There are many like that nowadays.\nShe looks refined, too, as though she were a lady,” and he bent over her\nonce more.\n\nPerhaps he had daughters growing up like that, “looking like ladies and\nrefined” with pretensions to gentility and smartness....\n\n“The chief thing is,” Raskolnikov persisted, “to keep her out of this\nscoundrel’s hands! Why should he outrage her! It’s as clear as day what\nhe is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off!”\n\nRaskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. The gentleman heard him,\nand seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and\nconfined himself to a contemptuous look. He then walked slowly another\nten paces away and again halted.\n\n“Keep her out of his hands we can,” said the constable thoughtfully,\n“if only she’d tell us where to take her, but as it is.... Missy, hey,\nmissy!” he bent over her once more.\n\nShe opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, as\nthough realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in the\ndirection from which she had come. “Oh shameful wretches, they won’t let\nme alone!” she said, waving her hand again. She walked quickly, though\nstaggering as before. The dandy followed her, but along another avenue,\nkeeping his eye on her.\n\n“Don’t be anxious, I won’t let him have her,” the policeman said\nresolutely, and he set off after them.\n\n“Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!” he repeated aloud, sighing.\n\nAt that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant a\ncomplete revulsion of feeling came over him.\n\n“Hey, here!” he shouted after the policeman.\n\nThe latter turned round.\n\n“Let them be! What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let him amuse\nhimself.” He pointed at the dandy, “What is it to do with you?”\n\nThe policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed. Raskolnikov\nlaughed.\n\n“Well!” ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and he\nwalked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for a\nmadman or something even worse.\n\n“He has carried off my twenty copecks,” Raskolnikov murmured angrily\nwhen he was left alone. “Well, let him take as much from the other\nfellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end. And why did I\nwant to interfere? Is it for me to help? Have I any right to help? Let\nthem devour each other alive--what is it to me? How did I dare to give him\ntwenty copecks? Were they mine?”\n\nIn spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He sat down on\nthe deserted seat. His thoughts strayed aimlessly.... He found it hard\nto fix his mind on anything at that moment. He longed to forget himself\naltogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life\nanew....\n\n“Poor girl!” he said, looking at the empty corner where she had\nsat--“She will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will find\nout.... She will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating and\nthen maybe, turn her out of doors.... And even if she does not, the\nDarya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon be\nslipping out on the sly here and there. Then there will be the hospital\ndirectly (that’s always the luck of those girls with respectable\nmothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then... again the hospital...\ndrink... the taverns... and more hospital, in two or three years--a\nwreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen.... Have not I seen\ncases like that? And how have they been brought to it? Why, they’ve all\ncome to it like that. Ugh! But what does it matter? That’s as it should\nbe, they tell us. A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year\ngo... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain\nchaste, and not be interfered with. A percentage! What splendid words\nthey have; they are so scientific, so consolatory.... Once you’ve said\n‘percentage’ there’s nothing more to worry about. If we had any other\nword... maybe we might feel more uneasy.... But what if Dounia were one\nof the percentage! Of another one if not that one?\n\n“But where am I going?” he thought suddenly. “Strange, I came out for\nsomething. As soon as I had read the letter I came out.... I was going\nto Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That’s what it was... now I\nremember. What for, though? And what put the idea of going to Razumihin\ninto my head just now? That’s curious.”\n\nHe wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the\nuniversity. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at\nthe university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did\nnot welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave\nhim up. He took no part in the students’ gatherings, amusements or\nconversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself,\nand he was respected for this, but no one liked him. He was very poor,\nand there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though\nhe were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comrades\nto look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in\ndevelopment, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and\ninterests were beneath him.\n\nWith Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and\ncommunicative with him. Indeed it was impossible to be on any other\nterms with Razumihin. He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid\nyouth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and\ndignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better of his comrades\nunderstood this, and all were fond of him. He was extremely intelligent,\nthough he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of striking\nappearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He was\nsometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.\nOne night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid\na gigantic policeman on his back. There was no limit to his drinking\npowers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went\ntoo far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.\nAnother thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, and\nit seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. He\ncould lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. He was\nvery poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of\none sort or another. He knew of no end of resources by which to earn\nmoney. He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to\ndeclare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in\nthe cold. For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the\nuniversity, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his\nmight to save enough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov had\nnot been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even\nknow his address. About two months before, they had met in the street,\nbut Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that\nhe might not be observed. And though Razumihin noticed him, he passed\nhim by, as he did not want to annoy him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n“Of course, I’ve been meaning lately to go to Razumihin’s to ask for\nwork, to ask him to get me lessons or something...” Raskolnikov thought,\n“but what help can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose\nhe shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that\nI could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons...\nhm... Well and what then? What shall I do with the few coppers I\nearn? That’s not what I want now. It’s really absurd for me to go to\nRazumihin....”\n\nThe question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even more\nthan he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister\nsignificance in this apparently ordinary action.\n\n“Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by\nmeans of Razumihin alone?” he asked himself in perplexity.\n\nHe pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long\nmusing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic\nthought came into his head.\n\n“Hm... to Razumihin’s,” he said all at once, calmly, as though he had\nreached a final determination. “I shall go to Razumihin’s of course,\nbut... not now. I shall go to him... on the next day after It, when It\nwill be over and everything will begin afresh....”\n\nAnd suddenly he realised what he was thinking.\n\n“After It,” he shouted, jumping up from the seat, “but is It really\ngoing to happen? Is it possible it really will happen?” He left the\nseat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards,\nbut the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing;\nin that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all _this_ had for a\nmonth past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random.\n\nHis nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel\nshivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a kind of effort he\nbegan almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all\nthe objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his\nattention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into\nbrooding. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round,\nhe forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he\nwas going. In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came\nout on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the\nislands. The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary\neyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in\nand weighed upon him. Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness,\nno stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid\nirritability. Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer\nvilla standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw\nin the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies,\nand children running in the gardens. The flowers especially caught his\nattention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. He was met, too, by\nluxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them\nwith curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from\nhis sight. Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had\nthirty copecks. “Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the\nletter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs\nyesterday,” he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but he\nsoon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.\nHe recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he\nwas hungry.... Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a\npie of some sort. He finished eating it as he walked away. It was a long\nwhile since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once,\nthough he only drank a wineglassful. His legs felt suddenly heavy and\na great drowsiness came upon him. He turned homewards, but reaching\nPetrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road\ninto the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.\n\nIn a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular\nactuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality. At times\nmonstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are\nso truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but\nso artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like\nPushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking\nstate. Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a\npowerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.\n\nRaskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back in his childhood\nin the little town of his birth. He was a child about seven years old,\nwalking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. It\nwas a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it;\nindeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in\nmemory. The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not\neven a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark\nblur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last market\ngarden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a\nfeeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.\nThere was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,\nhideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-looking\nfigures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to his\nfather, trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road\nbecame a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was a\nwinding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the\nright to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone\nchurch with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three\ntimes a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in\nmemory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never\nseen. On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a\ntable napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in\nthe shape of a cross. He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned\nikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmother’s\ngrave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger\nbrother who had died at six months old. He did not remember him at all,\nbut he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited\nthe graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and\nto bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he was\nwalking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he\nwas holding his father’s hand and looking with dread at the tavern. A\npeculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be\nsome kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed\ntownspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,\nall singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavern\nstood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usually\ndrawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy\ngoods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their\nlong manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect\nmountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going\nwith a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the shafts of\nsuch a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants’\nnags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load\nof wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in\na rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even\nabout the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that\nhe almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the\nwindow. All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing\nand the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken\npeasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over\ntheir shoulders.\n\n“Get in, get in!” shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with\na fleshy face red as a carrot. “I’ll take you all, get in!”\n\nBut at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the\ncrowd.\n\n“Take us all with a beast like that!”\n\n“Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?”\n\n“And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!”\n\n“Get in, I’ll take you all,” Mikolka shouted again, leaping first into\nthe cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front. “The bay\nhas gone with Matvey,” he shouted from the cart--“and this brute, mates,\nis just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her. She’s just\neating her head off. Get in, I tell you! I’ll make her gallop! She’ll\ngallop!” and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to\nflog the little mare.\n\n“Get in! Come along!” The crowd laughed. “D’you hear, she’ll gallop!”\n\n“Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!”\n\n“She’ll jog along!”\n\n“Don’t you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!”\n\n“All right! Give it to her!”\n\nThey all clambered into Mikolka’s cart, laughing and making jokes. Six\nmen got in and there was still room for more. They hauled in a fat,\nrosy-cheeked woman. She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded\nheaddress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.\nThe crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help\nlaughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a\ngallop! Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to\nhelp Mikolka. With the cry of “now,” the mare tugged with all her might,\nbut far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with\nher legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which\nwere showered upon her like hail. The laughter in the cart and in the\ncrowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed\nthe mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop.\n\n“Let me get in, too, mates,” shouted a young man in the crowd whose\nappetite was aroused.\n\n“Get in, all get in,” cried Mikolka, “she will draw you all. I’ll beat\nher to death!” And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself\nwith fury.\n\n“Father, father,” he cried, “father, what are they doing? Father, they\nare beating the poor horse!”\n\n“Come along, come along!” said his father. “They are drunken and\nfoolish, they are in fun; come away, don’t look!” and he tried to draw\nhim away, but he tore himself away from his hand, and, beside himself\nwith horror, ran to the horse. The poor beast was in a bad way. She was\ngasping, standing still, then tugging again and almost falling.\n\n“Beat her to death,” cried Mikolka, “it’s come to that. I’ll do for\nher!”\n\n“What are you about, are you a Christian, you devil?” shouted an old man\nin the crowd.\n\n“Did anyone ever see the like? A wretched nag like that pulling such a\ncartload,” said another.\n\n“You’ll kill her,” shouted the third.\n\n“Don’t meddle! It’s my property, I’ll do what I choose. Get in, more of\nyou! Get in, all of you! I will have her go at a gallop!...”\n\nAll at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare,\nroused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking. Even the old man\ncould not help smiling. To think of a wretched little beast like that\ntrying to kick!\n\nTwo lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her\nabout the ribs. One ran each side.\n\n“Hit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes,” cried Mikolka.\n\n“Give us a song, mates,” shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the\ncart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling. The\nwoman went on cracking nuts and laughing.\n\n... He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whipped\nacross the eyes, right in the eyes! He was crying, he felt choking, his\ntears were streaming. One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across\nthe face, he did not feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming, he\nrushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was\nshaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by the hand and\nwould have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back to\nthe mare. She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more.\n\n“I’ll teach you to kick,” Mikolka shouted ferociously. He threw down\nthe whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long,\nthick shaft, he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort\nbrandished it over the mare.\n\n“He’ll crush her,” was shouted round him. “He’ll kill her!”\n\n“It’s my property,” shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a\nswinging blow. There was a sound of a heavy thud.\n\n“Thrash her, thrash her! Why have you stopped?” shouted voices in the\ncrowd.\n\nAnd Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time\non the spine of the luckless mare. She sank back on her haunches, but\nlurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on\none side and then on the other, trying to move the cart. But the six\nwhips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised\nagain and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured\nblows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.\n\n“She’s a tough one,” was shouted in the crowd.\n\n“She’ll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of her,” said\nan admiring spectator in the crowd.\n\n“Fetch an axe to her! Finish her off,” shouted a third.\n\n“I’ll show you! Stand off,” Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw down\nthe shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. “Look\nout,” he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the\npoor mare. The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull,\nbut the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on\nthe ground like a log.\n\n“Finish her off,” shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself, out of\nthe cart. Several young men, also flushed with drink, seized anything\nthey could come across--whips, sticks, poles, and ran to the dying\nmare. Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the\ncrowbar. The mare stretched out her head, drew a long breath and died.\n\n“You butchered her,” someone shouted in the crowd.\n\n“Why wouldn’t she gallop then?”\n\n“My property!” shouted Mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, brandishing the bar\nin his hands. He stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to\nbeat.\n\n“No mistake about it, you are not a Christian,” many voices were\nshouting in the crowd.\n\nBut the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, screaming, through the\ncrowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round her bleeding dead head and\nkissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips.... Then he jumped up and\nflew in a frenzy with his little fists out at Mikolka. At that instant\nhis father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carried\nhim out of the crowd.\n\n“Come along, come! Let us go home,” he said to him.\n\n“Father! Why did they... kill... the poor horse!” he sobbed, but his\nvoice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest.\n\n“They are drunk.... They are brutal... it’s not our business!” said his\nfather. He put his arms round his father but he felt choked, choked. He\ntried to draw a breath, to cry out--and woke up.\n\nHe waked up, gasping for breath, his hair soaked with perspiration, and\nstood up in terror.\n\n“Thank God, that was only a dream,” he said, sitting down under a tree\nand drawing deep breaths. “But what is it? Is it some fever coming on?\nSuch a hideous dream!”\n\nHe felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his soul. He\nrested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands.\n\n“Good God!” he cried, “can it be, can it be, that I shall really take an\naxe, that I shall strike her on the head, split her skull open... that I\nshall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble;\nhide, all spattered in the blood... with the axe.... Good God, can it\nbe?”\n\nHe was shaking like a leaf as he said this.\n\n“But why am I going on like this?” he continued, sitting up again, as it\nwere in profound amazement. “I knew that I could never bring myself\nto it, so what have I been torturing myself for till now? Yesterday,\nyesterday, when I went to make that... _experiment_, yesterday I\nrealised completely that I could never bear to do it.... Why am I going\nover it again, then? Why am I hesitating? As I came down the stairs\nyesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile... the\nvery thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror.\n\n“No, I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it! Granted, granted that there is\nno flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this last\nmonth is clear as day, true as arithmetic.... My God! Anyway I couldn’t\nbring myself to it! I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it! Why, why then am\nI still...?”\n\nHe rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at\nfinding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge. He was pale,\nhis eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenly\nto breathe more easily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that\nhad so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense\nof relief and peace in his soul. “Lord,” he prayed, “show me my path--I\nrenounce that accursed... dream of mine.”\n\nCrossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at the\nglowing red sun setting in the glowing sky. In spite of his weakness he\nwas not conscious of fatigue. It was as though an abscess that had been\nforming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken. Freedom,\nfreedom! He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!\n\nLater on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during\nthose days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiously\nimpressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very\nexceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestined\nturning-point of his fate. He could never understand and explain to\nhimself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have been\nmore convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way,\nhe had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go. It was\nobviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so. It\nis true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without\nnoticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was always asking\nhimself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time\nsuch an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he\nhad moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of his\nlife when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances\nin which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive\ninfluence on his whole destiny? As though it had been lying in wait for\nhim on purpose!\n\nIt was about nine o’clock when he crossed the Hay Market. At the tables\nand the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were\nclosing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their\nwares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag pickers and\ncostermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty\nand stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularly\nliked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly\nin the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,\nand one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. At\nthe corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out\nwith tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, too, had got up to\ngo home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just\ncome up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone\ncalled her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona\nIvanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his\nwatch and make his _experiment_.... He already knew all about Lizaveta\nand she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of about\nthirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She was\na complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who\nmade her work day and night, and even beat her. She was standing with\na bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and\ndoubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. The\nmoment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange\nsensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing\nastonishing about this meeting.\n\n“You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna,” the\nhuckster was saying aloud. “Come round to-morrow about seven. They will\nbe here too.”\n\n“To-morrow?” said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to\nmake up her mind.\n\n“Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna,” gabbled\nthe huckster’s wife, a lively little woman. “I look at you, you are like\nsome little babe. And she is not your own sister either--nothing but a\nstep-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!”\n\n“But this time don’t say a word to Alyona Ivanovna,” her husband\ninterrupted; “that’s my advice, but come round to us without asking.\nIt will be worth your while. Later on your sister herself may have a\nnotion.”\n\n“Am I to come?”\n\n“About seven o’clock to-morrow. And they will be here. You will be able\nto decide for yourself.”\n\n“And we’ll have a cup of tea,” added his wife.\n\n“All right, I’ll come,” said Lizaveta, still pondering, and she began\nslowly moving away.\n\nRaskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He passed softly,\nunnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followed\nby a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine. He had\nlearnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at\nseven o’clock Lizaveta, the old woman’s sister and only companion, would\nbe away from home and that therefore at seven o’clock precisely the old\nwoman _would be left alone_.\n\nHe was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like a man\ncondemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;\nbut he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom\nof thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably\ndecided.\n\nCertainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he\ncould not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan\nthan that which had just presented itself. In any case, it would have\nbeen difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with\ngreater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and\ninvestigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whose\nlife an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nLater on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his\nwife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there was\nnothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and been\nreduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all\nwomen’s things. As the things would have fetched little in the market,\nthey were looking for a dealer. This was Lizaveta’s business. She\nundertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest\nand always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a rule\nlittle and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.\n\nBut Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces of\nsuperstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.\nAnd in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something\nstrange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar\ninfluences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew\ncalled Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to\ngive him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he\nmight want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her, for\nhe had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had\nremembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his\nfather’s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,\na present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. When\nhe found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her\nat the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her. He got\ntwo roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way\nhome. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strange\nidea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very\nmuch absorbed him.\n\nAlmost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he\ndid not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. They had\nplayed a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard\nthe student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and\ngive him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he\nhad just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of course\nit was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary\nimpression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;\nthe student began telling his friend various details about Alyona\nIvanovna.\n\n“She is first-rate,” he said. “You can always get money from her. She is\nas rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and\nshe is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows have\nhad dealings with her. But she is an awful old harpy....”\n\nAnd he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you\nwere only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she\ngave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven\npercent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on, saying\nthat she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was\ncontinually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,\nthough Lizaveta was at least six feet high.\n\n“There’s a phenomenon for you,” cried the student and he laughed.\n\nThey began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with a\npeculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened\nwith great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending\nfor him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about\nher. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,\nbeing the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She worked\nday and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the\nwashing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister\nall she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind\nwithout her sister’s permission. The old woman had already made her\nwill, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a\nfarthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was\nleft to a monastery in the province of N----, that prayers might be\nsaid for her in perpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister,\nunmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long\nfeet that looked as if they were bent outwards. She always wore battered\ngoatskin shoes, and was clean in her person. What the student expressed\nmost surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was\ncontinually with child.\n\n“But you say she is hideous?” observed the officer.\n\n“Yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, but\nyou know she is not at all hideous. She has such a good-natured face\nand eyes. Strikingly so. And the proof of it is that lots of people are\nattracted by her. She is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up\nwith anything, always willing, willing to do anything. And her smile is\nreally very sweet.”\n\n“You seem to find her attractive yourself,” laughed the officer.\n\n“From her queerness. No, I’ll tell you what. I could kill that damned\nold woman and make off with her money, I assure you, without the\nfaintest conscience-prick,” the student added with warmth. The officer\nlaughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!\n\n“Listen, I want to ask you a serious question,” the student said hotly.\n“I was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid,\nsenseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply\nuseless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is\nliving for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case. You\nunderstand? You understand?”\n\n“Yes, yes, I understand,” answered the officer, watching his excited\ncompanion attentively.\n\n“Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for\nwant of help and by thousands, on every side! A hundred thousand good\ndeeds could be done and helped, on that old woman’s money which will be\nburied in a monastery! Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on the\nright path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from\nvice, from the Lock hospitals--and all with her money. Kill her, take\nher money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of\nhumanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tiny\ncrime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousands\nwould be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred lives\nin exchange--it’s simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life of\nthat sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!\nNo more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact\nbecause the old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives of\nothers; the other day she bit Lizaveta’s finger out of spite; it almost\nhad to be amputated.”\n\n“Of course she does not deserve to live,” remarked the officer, “but\nthere it is, it’s nature.”\n\n“Oh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, but\nfor that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice. But for that,\nthere would never have been a single great man. They talk of\nduty, conscience--I don’t want to say anything against duty and\nconscience;--but the point is, what do we mean by them? Stay, I have\nanother question to ask you. Listen!”\n\n“No, you stay, I’ll ask you a question. Listen!”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“You are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, would you kill the\nold woman _yourself_?”\n\n“Of course not! I was only arguing the justice of it.... It’s nothing to\ndo with me....”\n\n“But I think, if you would not do it yourself, there’s no justice about\nit.... Let us have another game.”\n\nRaskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course, it was all ordinary\nyouthful talk and thought, such as he had often heard before in\ndifferent forms and on different themes. But why had he happened to hear\nsuch a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain\nwas just conceiving... _the very same ideas_? And why, just at the\nmoment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old\nwoman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her? This\ncoincidence always seemed strange to him. This trivial talk in a tavern\nhad an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there had\nreally been in it something preordained, some guiding hint....\n\n*****\n\nOn returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and sat\nfor a whole hour without stirring. Meanwhile it got dark; he had no\ncandle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up. He could never\nrecollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time. At\nlast he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realised\nwith relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon heavy, leaden sleep\ncame over him, as it were crushing him.\n\nHe slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming. Nastasya,\ncoming into his room at ten o’clock the next morning, had difficulty\nin rousing him. She brought him in tea and bread. The tea was again the\nsecond brew and again in her own tea-pot.\n\n“My goodness, how he sleeps!” she cried indignantly. “And he is always\nasleep.”\n\nHe got up with an effort. His head ached, he stood up, took a turn in\nhis garret and sank back on the sofa again.\n\n“Going to sleep again,” cried Nastasya. “Are you ill, eh?”\n\nHe made no reply.\n\n“Do you want some tea?”\n\n“Afterwards,” he said with an effort, closing his eyes again and turning\nto the wall.\n\nNastasya stood over him.\n\n“Perhaps he really is ill,” she said, turned and went out. She came in\nagain at two o’clock with soup. He was lying as before. The tea stood\nuntouched. Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully\nrousing him.\n\n“Why are you lying like a log?” she shouted, looking at him with\nrepulsion.\n\nHe got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor.\n\n“Are you ill or not?” asked Nastasya and again received no answer.\n“You’d better go out and get a breath of air,” she said after a pause.\n“Will you eat it or not?”\n\n“Afterwards,” he said weakly. “You can go.”\n\nAnd he motioned her out.\n\nShe remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and went\nout.\n\nA few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long while\nat the tea and the soup. Then he took the bread, took up a spoon and\nbegan to eat.\n\nHe ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were\nmechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself\non the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,\nwith his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and such\nstrange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was\nin Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting,\nthe camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a\ncomplete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking water\nfrom a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was\nwonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured\nstones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like\ngold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself,\nraised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,\nsuddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the\nsofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began\nlistening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quiet\non the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange and\nmonstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the\nprevious day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... And\nmeanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefaction\nwere followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted\nhaste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all his\nenergies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart\nkept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had\nto make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. He\nrummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away\nunder it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long\nstrip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded\nthis strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some\nstout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two\nends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shook\nas he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside\nwhen he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready\nlong before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for the\nnoose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended\nfor the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the\nstreet in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still have\nhad to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Now\nhe had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang\nquietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coat\npocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did\nnot swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it\ncould not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the\nhand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed a\nfortnight before.\n\nWhen he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening\nbetween his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out\nthe _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. This\npledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and\nthickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of wood\nin one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of\na workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece\nof iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.\nPutting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,\nhe fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round\nthem; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and\ntied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This\nwas in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while\nshe was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron strip\nwas added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first\nminute that the “thing” was made of wood. All this had been stored by\nhim beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out when\nhe heard someone suddenly about in the yard.\n\n“It struck six long ago.”\n\n“Long ago! My God!”\n\nHe rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend\nhis thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat. He had still the\nmost important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That the\ndeed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a\npocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less\non his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note in\npassing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by\nhim in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final\nthey were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in\nhis eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for\na single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his\nplans.\n\nAnd, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point\ncould have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of\nany kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all\nas something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of\nunsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe,\nthat trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.\nNastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;\nshe would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the\ndoor ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her\nabout. And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into\nthe kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything\nwas over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.\nSupposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had\ncome back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and wait\ntill she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss\nthe axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at\nleast grounds for suspicion.\n\nBut those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and\nindeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point, and put off\ntrifling details, until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemed\nutterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could not\nimagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get\nup and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit with\nthe object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at\nan experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say\n“come, let us go and try it--why dream about it!”--and at once he\nhad broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.\nMeanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his\nanalysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he\ncould not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resort\nhe simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought\narguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were\nforcing and drawing him to it.\n\nAt first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one\nquestion; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily\ndetected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? He\nhad come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his\nopinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility\nof concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost every\ncriminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a\nchildish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence\nand caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipse\nof reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease,\ndeveloped gradually and reached its highest point just before the\nperpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment\nof the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the\nindividual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The\nquestion whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the\ncrime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of\nthe nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.\n\nWhen he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there\ncould not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would\nremain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the\nsimple reason that his design was “not a crime....” We will omit all the\nprocess by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have\nrun too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purely\nmaterial difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his\nmind. “One has but to keep all one’s will-power and reason to deal\nwith them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has\nfamiliarised oneself with the minutest details of the business....” But\nthis preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what he\ncame to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite\ndifferently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.\n\nOne trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even\nleft the staircase. When he reached the landlady’s kitchen, the door\nof which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in\nNastasya’s absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether\nthe door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when\nhe went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenly\nsaw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied\nthere, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing\nhim, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him\nall the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past as\nthough he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had not\nthe axe! He was overwhelmed.\n\n“What made me think,” he reflected, as he went under the gateway, “what\nmade me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!\nWhy, why, why did I assume this so certainly?”\n\nHe was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself in\nhis anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.\n\nHe stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go a walk\nfor appearance’ sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more\nrevolting. “And what a chance I have lost for ever!” he muttered,\nstanding aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter’s little\ndark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porter’s\nroom, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the\nright caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached the\nroom on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called\nthe porter. “Yes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for\nthe door is wide open.” He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled\nit out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;\nat once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both\nhands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!\n“When reason fails, the devil helps!” he thought with a strange grin.\nThis chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.\n\nHe walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening\nsuspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking\nat their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.\nSuddenly he thought of his hat. “Good heavens! I had the money the day\nbefore yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!” A curse rose\nfrom the bottom of his soul.\n\nGlancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on\nthe wall that it was ten minutes past seven. He had to make haste and at\nthe same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the\nother side....\n\nWhen he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes\nthought that he would be very much afraid. But he was not very much\nafraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His mind was even occupied\nby irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov\ngarden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great\nfountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all\nthe squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer\ngarden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the\ngarden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a\ngreat benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question why\nin all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some\npeculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there\nare no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all\nsorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back\nto his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. “What nonsense!”\n he thought, “better think of nothing at all!”\n\n“So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that\nmeets them on the way,” flashed through his mind, but simply flashed,\nlike lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by now\nhe was near; here was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock\nsomewhere struck once. “What! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it\nmust be fast!”\n\nLuckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. At that very\nmoment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay had\njust driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed under\nthe gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into\nthe yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the other\nside of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one\nnoticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that huge\nquadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his\nhead--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the old\nwoman’s room was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He was\nalready on the stairs....\n\nDrawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and\nonce more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly\nand cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But the\nstairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no\none. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were\nat work in it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thought\na minute and went on. “Of course it would be better if they had not been\nhere, but... it’s two storeys above them.”\n\nAnd there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the\nflat opposite, the empty one. The flat underneath the old woman’s was\napparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been\ntorn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instant\nthe thought floated through his mind “Shall I go back?” But he made no\nanswer and began listening at the old woman’s door, a dead silence. Then\nhe listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...\nthen looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew\nhimself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose. “Am I very pale?”\n he wondered. “Am I not evidently agitated? She is mistrustful.... Had I\nbetter wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?”\n\nBut his heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spite\nhim, it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer,\nhe slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later he\nrang again, more loudly.\n\nNo answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old woman\nwas, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone. He had some\nknowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.\nEither his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to\nsuppose), or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway, he suddenly\nheard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the\nrustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthily\nclose to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly\nlistening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He moved\na little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have\nthe appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,\nand without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out\nin his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he\nhad had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and\nhe was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard the\nlatch unfastened.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and\nsuspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness. Then Raskolnikov lost\nhis head and nearly made a great mistake.\n\nFearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and not\nhoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions, he took\nhold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from\nattempting to shut it again. Seeing this she did not pull the door back,\nbut she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with\nit on to the stairs. Seeing that she was standing in the doorway not\nallowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her. She stepped back\nin alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared\nwith open eyes at him.\n\n“Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna,” he began, trying to speak easily, but\nhis voice would not obey him, it broke and shook. “I have come... I have\nbrought something... but we’d better come in... to the light....”\n\nAnd leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited. The old\nwoman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed.\n\n“Good heavens! What it is? Who is it? What do you want?”\n\n“Why, Alyona Ivanovna, you know me... Raskolnikov... here, I brought you\nthe pledge I promised the other day...” And he held out the pledge.\n\nThe old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared in\nthe eyes of her uninvited visitor. She looked intently, maliciously and\nmistrustfully. A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer\nin her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything. He felt that\nhe was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened\nthat if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half\nminute, he thought he would have run away from her.\n\n“Why do you look at me as though you did not know me?” he said suddenly,\nalso with malice. “Take it if you like, if not I’ll go elsewhere, I am\nin a hurry.”\n\nHe had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of\nitself. The old woman recovered herself, and her visitor’s resolute tone\nevidently restored her confidence.\n\n“But why, my good sir, all of a minute.... What is it?” she asked,\nlooking at the pledge.\n\n“The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you know.”\n\nShe held out her hand.\n\n“But how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?\nHave you been bathing, or what?”\n\n“Fever,” he answered abruptly. “You can’t help getting pale... if you’ve\nnothing to eat,” he added, with difficulty articulating the words.\n\nHis strength was failing him again. But his answer sounded like the\ntruth; the old woman took the pledge.\n\n“What is it?” she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, and\nweighing the pledge in her hand.\n\n“A thing... cigarette case.... Silver.... Look at it.”\n\n“It does not seem somehow like silver.... How he has wrapped it up!”\n\nTrying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (all\nher windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she left\nhim altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. He\nunbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet\ntake it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the\ncoat. His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing\nmore numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip and\nfall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.\n\n“But what has he tied it up like this for?” the old woman cried with\nvexation and moved towards him.\n\nHe had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swung\nit with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without\neffort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. He\nseemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once\nbrought the axe down, his strength returned to him.\n\nThe old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streaked\nwith grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat’s tail and\nfastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.\nAs she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. She\ncried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the\nfloor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held “the\npledge.” Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side\nand on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the\nbody fell back. He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her\nface; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,\nthe brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.\n\nHe laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her\npocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket\nfrom which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full\npossession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his\nhands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had been\nparticularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get\nsmeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,\nas before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom\nwith them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.\nAgainst the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with\na silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest of\ndrawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the\nchest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed\nover him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go\naway. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.\nHe positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea\noccurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be\nstill alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest,\nhe ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more\nover the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt that\nshe was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw\nclearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. He\nwas about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed\nit was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of\nblood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but\nthe string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked\nwith blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but\nsomething held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised\nthe axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not\ndare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,\nafter two minutes’ hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off\nwithout touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a\npurse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of\ncopper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy\nchamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed\nvery full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,\nflung the crosses on the old woman’s body and rushed back into the\nbedroom, this time taking the axe with him.\n\nHe was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them\nagain. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. It\nwas not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making\nmistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one\nand would not fit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered\nand realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging\nthere with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of\ndrawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,\nand that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chest\nof drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old\nwomen usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a\ngood-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched\nlid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notched\nkey fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, was\na coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,\nthen a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but\nclothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on\nthe red brocade. “It’s red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,”\n the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.\n“Good God, am I going out of my senses?” he thought with terror.\n\nBut no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from\nunder the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turned\nout to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably\nall pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,\near-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others simply\nwrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with\ntape. Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers\nand overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he\nhad not time to take many....\n\nHe suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stopped\nshort and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have been\nhis fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though\nsomeone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence for\na minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited\nholding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of\nthe bedroom.\n\nIn the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.\nShe was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet\nand seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run out\nof the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a\nshudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but\nstill did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into the\ncorner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no\nsound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at her\nwith the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies’ mouths,\nwhen they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them\nand are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was so\nsimple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not\neven raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary\nand natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.\nShe only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding\nit out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with the\nsharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the\nhead. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head,\nsnatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.\n\nFear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this\nsecond, quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the place\nas fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing\nand reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the\ndifficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the\nabsurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,\nperhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of\nthat place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would\nhave flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and\nnot from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had\ndone. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew\nstronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or even\ninto the room for anything in the world.\n\nBut a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take\npossession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what\nwas of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the\nkitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought\nhim of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.\nHe dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap\nthat lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands\nin the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the\nblade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where\nthere were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all\nwith some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and\nthen he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.\nThere was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He\ncarefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was\npossible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,\nhis trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to be\nnothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.\nBut he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something\nquite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of the\nroom, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea\nthat he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,\nof protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something\nutterly different from what he was now doing. “Good God!” he muttered “I\nmust fly, fly,” and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock of terror\nawaited him such as he had never known before.\n\nHe stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer\ndoor from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,\nwas standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt,\nall the time, all that time! The old woman had not shut it after him\nperhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizaveta\nafterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that\nshe must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!\n\nHe dashed to the door and fastened the latch.\n\n“But no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get away....”\n\nHe unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the\nstaircase.\n\nHe listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,\ntwo voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.\n“What are they about?” He waited patiently. At last all was still, as\nthough suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out,\nbut suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone\nbegan going downstairs humming a tune. “How is it they all make such\na noise?” flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door and\nwaited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was just taking a\nstep towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.\n\nThe steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but\nhe remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he\nbegan for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,\nto the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow\npeculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now\n_he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was\ngrowing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. And\nnow the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed to\nhim all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream\nin which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is\nrooted to the spot and cannot even move one’s arms.\n\nAt last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly\nstarted, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the\nflat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly,\nnoiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had\ndone this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown\nvisitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite one\nanother, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when\nthe door divided them and he was listening.\n\nThe visitor panted several times. “He must be a big, fat man,” thought\nRaskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dream\nindeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.\n\nAs soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of\nsomething moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quite\nseriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently\nand impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror\nat the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every\nminute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seem\npossible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the\nfastening, but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over him\nagain. “I shall fall down!” flashed through his mind, but the unknown\nbegan to speak and he recovered himself at once.\n\n“What’s up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!” he bawled in a\nthick voice, “Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,\nmy beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?”\n\nAnd again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at\nthe bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate\nacquaintance.\n\nAt this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the\nstairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them at\nfirst.\n\n“You don’t say there’s no one at home,” the new-comer cried in a\ncheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on\npulling the bell. “Good evening, Koch.”\n\n“From his voice he must be quite young,” thought Raskolnikov.\n\n“Who the devil can tell? I’ve almost broken the lock,” answered Koch.\n“But how do you come to know me?”\n\n“Why! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at\nbilliards at Gambrinus’.”\n\n“Oh!”\n\n“So they are not at home? That’s queer. It’s awfully stupid though.\nWhere could the old woman have gone? I’ve come on business.”\n\n“Yes; and I have business with her, too.”\n\n“Well, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping to\nget some money!” cried the young man.\n\n“We must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? The\nold witch fixed the time for me to come herself. It’s out of my way.\nAnd where the devil she can have got to, I can’t make out. She sits here\nfrom year’s end to year’s end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet\nhere all of a sudden she is out for a walk!”\n\n“Hadn’t we better ask the porter?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Where she’s gone and when she’ll be back.”\n\n“Hm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go\nanywhere.”\n\nAnd he once more tugged at the door-handle.\n\n“Damn it all. There’s nothing to be done, we must go!”\n\n“Stay!” cried the young man suddenly. “Do you see how the door shakes if\nyou pull it?”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“That shows it’s not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how\nthe hook clanks?”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“Why, don’t you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If they\nwere all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the\nkey and not with the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hook\nis clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,\ndon’t you see. So there they are sitting inside and don’t open the\ndoor!”\n\n“Well! And so they must be!” cried Koch, astonished. “What are they\nabout in there?” And he began furiously shaking the door.\n\n“Stay!” cried the young man again. “Don’t pull at it! There must be\nsomething wrong.... Here, you’ve been ringing and pulling at the door\nand still they don’t open! So either they’ve both fainted or...”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I tell you what. Let’s go fetch the porter, let him wake them up.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nBoth were going down.\n\n“Stay. You stop here while I run down for the porter.”\n\n“What for?”\n\n“Well, you’d better.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“I’m studying the law you see! It’s evident, e-vi-dent there’s something\nwrong here!” the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs.\n\nKoch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one\ntinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began\ntouching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once\nmore that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting he\nbent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock\non the inside and so nothing could be seen.\n\nRaskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort of\ndelirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.\nWhile they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times\noccurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the\ndoor. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,\nwhile they could not open the door! “Only make haste!” was the thought\nthat flashed through his mind.\n\n“But what the devil is he about?...” Time was passing, one minute, and\nanother--no one came. Koch began to be restless.\n\n“What the devil?” he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his\nsentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy\nboots on the stairs. The steps died away.\n\n“Good heavens! What am I to do?”\n\nRaskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.\nAbruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as\nthoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.\n\nHe had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice\nbelow--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just going\nback to the flat.\n\n“Hey there! Catch the brute!”\n\nSomebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran\ndown the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.\n\n“Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!”\n\nThe shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was\nstill. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began\nnoisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. He\ndistinguished the ringing voice of the young man. “Hey!”\n\nFilled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling “come what\nmust!” If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all was\nlost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were only\na flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on the\nright, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the\nsecond floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though\nfor his benefit, they had just left. It was they, no doubt, who had just\nrun down, shouting. The floor had only just been painted, in the middle\nof the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In one\ninstant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall\nand only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.\nThen they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly. He\nwaited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.\n\nNo one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed quickly through\nthe gateway and turned to the left in the street.\n\nHe knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the\nflat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as\nthe door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the\nbodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and\ncompletely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had\nsucceeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They would\nguess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were\ngoing upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though\nthe next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. “Should he\nslip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No,\nhopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless,\nhopeless!”\n\nAt last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.\nHere he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky\nbecause there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a\ngrain of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could\nscarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.\n“My word, he has been going it!” someone shouted at him when he came out\non the canal bank.\n\nHe was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the\nworse it was. He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal\nbank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more\nconspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost\nfalling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from\nquite a different direction.\n\nHe was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his\nhouse! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.\nAnd yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to\nescape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course\nincapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to\nrestore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody’s yard. But\nit all happened fortunately, the door of the porter’s room was closed\nbut not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at\nhome. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he\nwalked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him,\n“What do you want?” he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe. But\nagain the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe\nback under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as\nbefore. He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room;\nthe landlady’s door was shut. When he was in his room, he flung himself\non the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blank\nforgetfulness. If anyone had come into his room then, he would have\njumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of thoughts were\nsimply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he could\nnot rest on one, in spite of all his efforts....\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nSo he lay a very long while. Now and then he seemed to wake up, and at\nsuch moments he noticed that it was far into the night, but it did not\noccur to him to get up. At last he noticed that it was beginning to get\nlight. He was lying on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion.\nFearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he\nheard every night, indeed, under his window after two o’clock. They woke\nhim up now.\n\n“Ah! the drunken men are coming out of the taverns,” he thought, “it’s\npast two o’clock,” and at once he leaped up, as though someone had\npulled him from the sofa.\n\n“What! Past two o’clock!”\n\nHe sat down on the sofa--and instantly recollected everything! All at\nonce, in one flash, he recollected everything.\n\nFor the first moment he thought he was going mad. A dreadful chill came\nover him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in\nhis sleep. Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his\nteeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door and\nbegan listening--everything in the house was asleep. With amazement he\ngazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he\ncould have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have\nflung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his\nhat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.\n\n“If anyone had come in, what would he have thought? That I’m drunk\nbut...”\n\nHe rushed to the window. There was light enough, and he began hurriedly\nlooking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there\nno traces? But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he\nbegan taking off everything and looking over again. He turned everything\nover to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through\nhis search three times.\n\nBut there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where\nsome thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge\nof his trousers. He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed\nthreads. There seemed to be nothing more.\n\nSuddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of\nthe old woman’s box were still in his pockets! He had not thought till\nthen of taking them out and hiding them! He had not even thought of them\nwhile he was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed\nto take them out and fling them on the table. When he had pulled out\neverything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was\nnothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper had\ncome off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He began\nstuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: “They’re in! All\nout of sight, and the purse too!” he thought gleefully, getting up and\ngazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. Suddenly\nhe shuddered all over with horror; “My God!” he whispered in despair:\n“what’s the matter with me? Is that hidden? Is that the way to hide\nthings?”\n\nHe had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had only thought of\nmoney, and so had not prepared a hiding-place.\n\n“But now, now, what am I glad of?” he thought, “Is that hiding things?\nMy reason’s deserting me--simply!”\n\nHe sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another\nunbearable fit of shivering. Mechanically he drew from a chair beside\nhim his old student’s winter coat, which was still warm though almost in\nrags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and\ndelirium. He lost consciousness.\n\nNot more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time,\nand at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.\n\n“How could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, yes; I have not\ntaken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!\nSuch a piece of evidence!”\n\nHe pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits\namong his linen under the pillow.\n\n“Pieces of torn linen couldn’t rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I\nthink not, I think not, any way!” he repeated, standing in the middle\nof the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about\nhim again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not\nforgotten anything. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory,\nand the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an\ninsufferable torture.\n\n“Surely it isn’t beginning already! Surely it isn’t my punishment coming\nupon me? It is!”\n\nThe frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the\nfloor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!\n\n“What is the matter with me!” he cried again, like one distraught.\n\nThen a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes\nwere covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many\nstains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because\nhis perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason was\nclouded.... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the\npurse too. “Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put\nthe wet purse in my pocket!”\n\nIn a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were\ntraces, stains on the lining of the pocket!\n\n“So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and\nmemory, since I guessed it of myself,” he thought triumphantly, with\na deep sigh of relief; “it’s simply the weakness of fever, a moment’s\ndelirium,” and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his\ntrousers. At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the\nsock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He\nflung off his boots; “traces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked with\nblood;” he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... “But what am I\nto do with this now? Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?”\n\nHe gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the\nroom.\n\n“In the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them?\nBut what can I burn them with? There are no matches even. No, better\ngo out and throw it all away somewhere. Yes, better throw it away,” he\nrepeated, sitting down on the sofa again, “and at once, this minute,\nwithout lingering...”\n\nBut his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icy\nshivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.\n\nAnd for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to\n“go off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that\nit may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!” Several times\nhe tried to rise from the sofa, but could not.\n\nHe was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.\n\n“Open, do, are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here!” shouted\nNastasya, banging with her fist on the door. “For whole days together\nhe’s snoring here like a dog! A dog he is too. Open I tell you. It’s\npast ten.”\n\n“Maybe he’s not at home,” said a man’s voice.\n\n“Ha! that’s the porter’s voice.... What does he want?”\n\nHe jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his heart was a\npositive pain.\n\n“Then who can have latched the door?” retorted Nastasya. “He’s taken to\nbolting himself in! As if he were worth stealing! Open, you stupid, wake\nup!”\n\n“What do they want? Why the porter? All’s discovered. Resist or open?\nCome what may!...”\n\nHe half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.\n\nHis room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the\nbed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.\n\nNastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with a defiant and\ndesperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded\npaper sealed with bottle-wax.\n\n“A notice from the office,” he announced, as he gave him the paper.\n\n“From what office?”\n\n“A summons to the police office, of course. You know which office.”\n\n“To the police?... What for?...”\n\n“How can I tell? You’re sent for, so you go.”\n\nThe man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to\ngo away.\n\n“He’s downright ill!” observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him.\nThe porter turned his head for a moment. “He’s been in a fever since\nyesterday,” she added.\n\nRaskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without\nopening it. “Don’t you get up then,” Nastasya went on compassionately,\nseeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. “You’re ill, and\nso don’t go; there’s no such hurry. What have you got there?”\n\nHe looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his\ntrousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. So he had been asleep\nwith them in his hand. Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that\nhalf waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand\nand so fallen asleep again.\n\n“Look at the rags he’s collected and sleeps with them, as though he has\ngot hold of a treasure...”\n\nAnd Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.\n\nInstantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his\neyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being capable of rational\nreflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that\nwith a person who was going to be arrested. “But... the police?”\n\n“You’d better have some tea! Yes? I’ll bring it, there’s some left.”\n\n“No... I’m going; I’ll go at once,” he muttered, getting on to his feet.\n\n“Why, you’ll never get downstairs!”\n\n“Yes, I’ll go.”\n\n“As you please.”\n\nShe followed the porter out.\n\nAt once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.\n\n“There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt,\nand rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion could\ndistinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed,\nthank God!” Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began\nreading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. It was an\nordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at\nhalf-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.\n\n“But when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do with\nthe police! And why just to-day?” he thought in agonising bewilderment.\n“Good God, only get it over soon!”\n\nHe was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into\nlaughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.\n\nHe began, hurriedly dressing. “If I’m lost, I am lost, I don’t care!\nShall I put the sock on?” he suddenly wondered, “it will get dustier\nstill and the traces will be gone.”\n\nBut no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing\nand horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks,\nhe picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.\n\n“That’s all conventional, that’s all relative, merely a way of looking\nat it,” he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his\nmind, while he was shuddering all over, “there, I’ve got it on! I have\nfinished by getting it on!”\n\nBut his laughter was quickly followed by despair.\n\n“No, it’s too much for me...” he thought. His legs shook. “From fear,”\n he muttered. His head swam and ached with fever. “It’s a trick! They\nwant to decoy me there and confound me over everything,” he mused, as\nhe went out on to the stairs--“the worst of it is I’m almost\nlight-headed... I may blurt out something stupid...”\n\nOn the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as\nthey were in the hole in the wall, “and very likely, it’s on purpose\nto search when I’m out,” he thought, and stopped short. But he was\npossessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call\nit, that with a wave of his hand he went on. “Only to get it over!”\n\nIn the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had\nfallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench\nfrom the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish\npedlars and half-broken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes,\nso that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going\nround--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the\nstreet on a bright sunny day.\n\nWhen he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony of\ntrepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted\nhis eyes.\n\n“If they question me, perhaps I’ll simply tell,” he thought, as he drew\nnear the police-station.\n\nThe police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It had lately been\nmoved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He had been once\nfor a moment in the old office but long ago. Turning in at the gateway,\nhe saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with\na book in his hand. “A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is\nhere,” and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He did not want\nto ask questions of anyone.\n\n“I’ll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything...” he thought, as\nhe reached the fourth floor.\n\nThe staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water. The\nkitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost\nthe whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat. The staircase\nwas crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their\narms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door of\nthe office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. There,\ntoo, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh\npaint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.\n\nAfter waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.\nAll the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him\non and on. No one paid attention to him. In the second room some\nclerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a\nqueer-looking set. He went up to one of them.\n\n“What is it?”\n\nHe showed the notice he had received.\n\n“You are a student?” the man asked, glancing at the notice.\n\n“Yes, formerly a student.”\n\nThe clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest. He was a\nparticularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.\n\n“There would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no\ninterest in anything,” thought Raskolnikov.\n\n“Go in there to the head clerk,” said the clerk, pointing towards the\nfurthest room.\n\nHe went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and\npacked full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.\nAmong them were two ladies. One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the\ntable opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.\nThe other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face,\nexcessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a\nsaucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.\nRaskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. The latter glanced\nat it, said: “Wait a minute,” and went on attending to the lady in\nmourning.\n\nHe breathed more freely. “It can’t be that!”\n\nBy degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have\ncourage and be calm.\n\n“Some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!\nHm... it’s a pity there’s no air here,” he added, “it’s stifling.... It\nmakes one’s head dizzier than ever... and one’s mind too...”\n\nHe was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was afraid of losing\nhis self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it,\nsomething quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all. Yet\nthe head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him\nand guess something from his face.\n\nHe was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile\nface that looked older than his years. He was fashionably dressed and\nfoppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded,\nand wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain\non his waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who\nwas in the room, and said them fairly correctly.\n\n“Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down,” he said casually to the\ngaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not\nventuring to sit down, though there was a chair beside her.\n\n“Ich danke,” said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank\ninto the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated\nabout the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. She\nsmelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half\nthe room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was\nimpudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.\n\nThe lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All at once, with\nsome noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of\nhis shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and\nsat down in an easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her\nseat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the\nofficer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture to\nsit down again in his presence. He was the assistant superintendent. He\nhad a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his\nface, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except\na certain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignantly at\nRaskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his\nhumiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his\nclothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on\nhim, so that he felt positively affronted.\n\n“What do you want?” he shouted, apparently astonished that such a ragged\nfellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance.\n\n“I was summoned... by a notice...” Raskolnikov faltered.\n\n“For the recovery of money due, from _the student_,” the head clerk\ninterfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his papers. “Here!” and he\nflung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place. “Read that!”\n\n“Money? What money?” thought Raskolnikov, “but... then... it’s certainly\nnot _that_.”\n\nAnd he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense indescribable relief. A\nload was lifted from his back.\n\n“And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?” shouted the\nassistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more\naggrieved. “You are told to come at nine, and now it’s twelve!”\n\n“The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago,” Raskolnikov\nanswered loudly over his shoulder. To his own surprise he, too, grew\nsuddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. “And it’s enough that\nI have come here ill with fever.”\n\n“Kindly refrain from shouting!”\n\n“I’m not shouting, I’m speaking very quietly, it’s you who are shouting\nat me. I’m a student, and allow no one to shout at me.”\n\nThe assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he\ncould only splutter inarticulately. He leaped up from his seat.\n\n“Be silent! You are in a government office. Don’t be impudent, sir!”\n\n“You’re in a government office, too,” cried Raskolnikov, “and you’re\nsmoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect\nto all of us.”\n\nHe felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.\n\nThe head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry assistant\nsuperintendent was obviously disconcerted.\n\n“That’s not your business!” he shouted at last with unnatural loudness.\n“Kindly make the declaration demanded of you. Show him. Alexandr\nGrigorievitch. There is a complaint against you! You don’t pay your\ndebts! You’re a fine bird!”\n\nBut Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the\npaper, in haste to find an explanation. He read it once, and a second\ntime, and still did not understand.\n\n“What is this?” he asked the head clerk.\n\n“It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You must\neither pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written\ndeclaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not\nto leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your\nproperty. The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed\nagainst you according to the law.”\n\n“But I... am not in debt to anyone!”\n\n“That’s not our business. Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteen\nroubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us\nfor recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine\nmonths ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov.\nWe therefore summon you, hereupon.”\n\n“But she is my landlady!”\n\n“And what if she is your landlady?”\n\nThe head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion,\nand at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire\nfor the first time--as though he would say: “Well, how do you feel now?”\n But what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was that\nworth worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, he\nread, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but\nall mechanically. The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from\noverwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that moment\nwithout thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions\nor surmises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an instant\nof full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very moment\nsomething like a thunderstorm took place in the office. The assistant\nsuperintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikov’s disrespect, still fuming\nand obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the\nunfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came in\nwith an exceedingly silly smile.\n\n“You shameful hussy!” he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice. (The\nlady in mourning had left the office.) “What was going on at your house\nlast night? Eh! A disgrace again, you’re a scandal to the whole street.\nFighting and drinking again. Do you want the house of correction? Why,\nI have warned you ten times over that I would not let you off the\neleventh! And here you are again, again, you... you...!”\n\nThe paper fell out of Raskolnikov’s hands, and he looked wildly at the\nsmart lady who was so unceremoniously treated. But he soon saw what it\nmeant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal. He\nlistened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his\nnerves were on edge.\n\n“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stopped\nshort, for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not\nbe stopped except by force.\n\nAs for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before the\nstorm. But, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms of\nabuse became, the more amiable she looked, and the more seductive the\nsmiles she lavished on the terrible assistant. She moved uneasily, and\ncurtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her\nword: and at last she found it.\n\n“There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain,” she\npattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently,\nthough with a strong German accent, “and no sort of scandal, and his\nhonour came drunk, and it’s the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain,\nand I am not to blame.... Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain,\nand honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike any\nscandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles\nagain, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte\nwith one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and\nhe _ganz_ broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I said\nso. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it. And then\nI called the porter, and Karl came, and he took Karl and hit him in the\neye; and he hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the\ncheek. And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain,\nand I screamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and stood in\nthe window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace. The idea of\nsquealing like a little pig at the window into the street! Fie upon him!\nAnd Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true,\nMr. Captain, he tore _sein rock_. And then he shouted that _man muss_\npay him fifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, five\nroubles for _sein rock_. And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused\nall the scandal. ‘I will show you up,’ he said, ‘for I can write to all\nthe papers about you.’”\n\n“Then he was an author?”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable\nhouse....”\n\n“Now then! Enough! I have told you already...”\n\n“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk repeated significantly.\n\nThe assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his\nhead.\n\n“... So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell it\nyou for the last time,” the assistant went on. “If there is a scandal\nin your honourable house once again, I will put you yourself in the\nlock-up, as it is called in polite society. Do you hear? So a literary\nman, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an ‘honourable\nhouse’? A nice set, these authors!”\n\nAnd he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. “There was a scandal\nthe other day in a restaurant, too. An author had eaten his dinner and\nwould not pay; ‘I’ll write a satire on you,’ says he. And there was\nanother of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful\nlanguage to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and\ndaughter. And there was one of them turned out of a confectioner’s shop\nthe other day. They are like that, authors, literary men, students,\ntown-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself one\nday. Then you had better be careful! Do you hear?”\n\nWith hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all\ndirections, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at the door, she\nstumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open\nface and splendid thick fair whiskers. This was the superintendent of\nthe district himself, Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste\nto curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she\nfluttered out of the office.\n\n“Again thunder and lightning--a hurricane!” said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya\nPetrovitch in a civil and friendly tone. “You are aroused again, you are\nfuming again! I heard it on the stairs!”\n\n“Well, what then!” Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance;\nand he walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing of\nhis shoulders at each step. “Here, if you will kindly look: an author,\nor a student, has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given\nan I O U, won’t clear out of his room, and complaints are constantly\nbeing lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to make a protest\nagainst my smoking in his presence! He behaves like a cad himself, and\njust look at him, please. Here’s the gentleman, and very attractive he\nis!”\n\n“Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off like powder,\nyou can’t bear a slight, I daresay you took offence at something and\nwent too far yourself,” continued Nikodim Fomitch, turning affably to\nRaskolnikov. “But you were wrong there; he is a capital fellow, I assure\nyou, but explosive, explosive! He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no\nstopping him! And then it’s all over! And at the bottom he’s a heart of\ngold! His nickname in the regiment was the Explosive Lieutenant....”\n\n“And what a regiment it was, too,” cried Ilya Petrovitch, much gratified\nat this agreeable banter, though still sulky.\n\nRaskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant\nto them all. “Excuse me, Captain,” he began easily, suddenly addressing\nNikodim Fomitch, “will you enter into my position?... I am ready to\nask pardon, if I have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sick\nand shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. I am not\nstudying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money.... I\nhave a mother and sister in the province of X. They will send it to\nme, and I will pay. My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she is so\nexasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for the\nlast four months, that she does not even send up my dinner... and I\ndon’t understand this I O U at all. She is asking me to pay her on this\nI O U. How am I to pay her? Judge for yourselves!...”\n\n“But that is not our business, you know,” the head clerk was observing.\n\n“Yes, yes. I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to explain...”\n Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but trying\nhis best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistently\nappeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously\noblivious of him. “Allow me to explain that I have been living with her\nfor nearly three years and at first... at first... for why should I not\nconfess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter, it\nwas a verbal promise, freely given... she was a girl... indeed, I liked\nher, though I was not in love with her... a youthful affair in fact...\nthat is, I mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in those\ndays, and I led a life of... I was very heedless...”\n\n“Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we’ve no time to\nwaste,” Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph;\nbut Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found it\nexceedingly difficult to speak.\n\n“But excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain... how it all\nhappened... In my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary.\nBut a year ago, the girl died of typhus. I remained lodging there as\nbefore, and when my landlady moved into her present quarters, she said\nto me... and in a friendly way... that she had complete trust in me,\nbut still, would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen\nroubles, all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her that,\nshe would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she would never,\nnever--those were her own words--make use of that I O U till I could pay\nof myself... and now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to\neat, she takes action against me. What am I to say to that?”\n\n“All these affecting details are no business of ours.” Ilya Petrovitch\ninterrupted rudely. “You must give a written undertaking but as for your\nlove affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with\nthat.”\n\n“Come now... you are harsh,” muttered Nikodim Fomitch, sitting down at\nthe table and also beginning to write. He looked a little ashamed.\n\n“Write!” said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.\n\n“Write what?” the latter asked, gruffly.\n\n“I will dictate to you.”\n\nRaskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and\ncontemptuously after his speech, but strange to say he suddenly felt\ncompletely indifferent to anyone’s opinion, and this revulsion took\nplace in a flash, in one instant. If he had cared to think a little,\nhe would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like\nthat a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. And where had\nthose feelings come from? Now if the whole room had been filled, not\nwith police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, he\nwould not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart. A\ngloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took\nconscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his sentimental\neffusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter’s\ntriumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart.\nOh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these petty\nvanities, officers, German women, debts, police-offices? If he had been\nsentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, would\nhardly have heard the sentence to the end. Something was happening to\nhim entirely new, sudden and unknown. It was not that he understood, but\nhe felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could\nnever more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental\neffusions like his recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and that\nif they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers,\nit would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any\ncircumstance of life. He had never experienced such a strange and awful\nsensation. And what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than a\nconception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all the\nsensations he had known in his life.\n\nThe head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration,\nthat he could not pay, that he undertook to do so at a future date, that\nhe would not leave the town, nor sell his property, and so on.\n\n“But you can’t write, you can hardly hold the pen,” observed the head\nclerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. “Are you ill?”\n\n“Yes, I am giddy. Go on!”\n\n“That’s all. Sign it.”\n\nThe head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to others.\n\nRaskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away,\nhe put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands. He\nfelt as if a nail were being driven into his skull. A strange idea\nsuddenly occurred to him, to get up at once, to go up to Nikodim\nFomitch, and tell him everything that had happened yesterday, and then\nto go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole\nin the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat\nto carry it out. “Hadn’t I better think a minute?” flashed through his\nmind. “No, better cast off the burden without thinking.” But all at once\nhe stood still, rooted to the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly\nwith Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him:\n\n“It’s impossible, they’ll both be released. To begin with, the whole\nstory contradicts itself. Why should they have called the porter, if it\nhad been their doing? To inform against themselves? Or as a blind? No,\nthat would be too cunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at\nthe gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He was walking\nwith three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the\nporters to direct him, in the presence of the friends. Now, would he\nhave asked his way if he had been going with such an object? As for\nKoch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith’s below, before he went\nup to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. Now\njust consider...”\n\n“But excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction? They state\nthemselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes\nlater when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was\nunfastened.”\n\n“That’s just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself\nin; and they’d have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been\nan ass and gone to look for the porter too. _He_ must have seized the\ninterval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossing\nhimself and saying: ‘If I had been there, he would have jumped out and\nkilled me with his axe.’ He is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha,\nha!”\n\n“And no one saw the murderer?”\n\n“They might well not see him; the house is a regular Noah’s Ark,” said\nthe head clerk, who was listening.\n\n“It’s clear, quite clear,” Nikodim Fomitch repeated warmly.\n\n“No, it is anything but clear,” Ilya Petrovitch maintained.\n\nRaskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door, but he did\nnot reach it....\n\nWhen he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair,\nsupported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standing\non the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and\nNikodim Fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him. He got up\nfrom the chair.\n\n“What’s this? Are you ill?” Nikodim Fomitch asked, rather sharply.\n\n“He could hardly hold his pen when he was signing,” said the head clerk,\nsettling back in his place, and taking up his work again.\n\n“Have you been ill long?” cried Ilya Petrovitch from his place, where\nhe, too, was looking through papers. He had, of course, come to look at\nthe sick man when he fainted, but retired at once when he recovered.\n\n“Since yesterday,” muttered Raskolnikov in reply.\n\n“Did you go out yesterday?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Though you were ill?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“At what time?”\n\n“About seven.”\n\n“And where did you go, may I ask?”\n\n“Along the street.”\n\n“Short and clear.”\n\nRaskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered sharply, jerkily,\nwithout dropping his black feverish eyes before Ilya Petrovitch’s stare.\n\n“He can scarcely stand upright. And you...” Nikodim Fomitch was\nbeginning.\n\n“No matter,” Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly.\n\nNikodim Fomitch would have made some further protest, but glancing at\nthe head clerk who was looking very hard at him, he did not speak. There\nwas a sudden silence. It was strange.\n\n“Very well, then,” concluded Ilya Petrovitch, “we will not detain you.”\n\nRaskolnikov went out. He caught the sound of eager conversation on his\ndeparture, and above the rest rose the questioning voice of Nikodim\nFomitch. In the street, his faintness passed off completely.\n\n“A search--there will be a search at once,” he repeated to himself,\nhurrying home. “The brutes! they suspect.”\n\nHis former terror mastered him completely again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n“And what if there has been a search already? What if I find them in my\nroom?”\n\nBut here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one had peeped in.\nEven Nastasya had not touched it. But heavens! how could he have left\nall those things in the hole?\n\nHe rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled the\nthings out and lined his pockets with them. There were eight articles in\nall: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly\nlooked to see; then four small leather cases. There was a chain, too,\nmerely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked\nlike a decoration.... He put them all in the different pockets of his\novercoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal\nthem as much as possible. He took the purse, too. Then he went out of\nhis room, leaving the door open. He walked quickly and resolutely, and\nthough he felt shattered, he had his senses about him. He was afraid of\npursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an\nhour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at\nall costs, he must hide all traces before then. He must clear everything\nup while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him....\nWhere was he to go?\n\nThat had long been settled: “Fling them into the canal, and all traces\nhidden in the water, the thing would be at an end.” So he had decided in\nthe night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to\nget up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get\nrid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along\nthe bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked\nseveral times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not\nthink of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps’ edge,\nand women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and\npeople were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed\nfrom the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go\ndown on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. And what if\nthe boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would.\nEven as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if\nthey had nothing to do but to watch him. “Why is it, or can it be my\nfancy?” he thought.\n\nAt last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the\nNeva. There were not so many people there, he would be less observed,\nand it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further\noff. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour,\nworried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it\nbefore. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply\nbecause he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent\nand forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.\n\nHe walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the way\nanother idea struck him. “Why to the Neva? Would it not be better to go\nsomewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things\nin some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot\nperhaps?” And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea\nseemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For\ncoming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a\npassage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right\nhand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far\ninto the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for\ntwenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. Here\nwas a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was\nlying. At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed,\napparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It\nwas probably a carriage builder’s or carpenter’s shed; the whole place\nfrom the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to\nthrow it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and\nat once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where\nthere are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had\nbeen scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, “Standing here\nstrictly forbidden.” This was all the better, for there would be nothing\nsuspicious about his going in. “Here I could throw it all in a heap and\nget away!”\n\nLooking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed\nagainst the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn\nstone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a\nstreet. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he\ncould not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the\nstreet, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.\n\nHe bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands,\nand using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small\nhollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.\nThe purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he\nseized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was\nin the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. But\nhe scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.\nNothing could be noticed.\n\nThen he went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense,\nalmost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in\nthe police-office. “I have buried my tracks! And who, who can think of\nlooking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since\nthe house was built, and will lie as many years more. And if it were\nfound, who would think of me? It is all over! No clue!” And he laughed.\nYes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless\nlaugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But\nwhen he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come\nupon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his\nmind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat\non which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it\nwould be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had\ngiven the twenty copecks: “Damn him!”\n\nHe walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now\nseemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there\nreally was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that\npoint--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.\n\n“Damn it all!” he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury.\n“If it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, how\nstupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned\nupon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I\ncare for them all, and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It\nis not that at all!”\n\nSuddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple\nquestion perplexed and bitterly confounded him.\n\n“If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if\nI really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even\nglance into the purse and don’t know what I had there, for which I have\nundergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base,\nfilthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the\nwater the purse together with all the things which I had not seen\neither... how’s that?”\n\nYes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all before, and\nit was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night\nwithout hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though\nit could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes, he had known it all, and\nunderstood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the\nmoment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out\nof it.... Yes, so it was.\n\n“It is because I am very ill,” he decided grimly at last, “I have been\nworrying and fretting myself, and I don’t know what I am doing....\nYesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been\nworrying myself.... I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But what\nif I don’t get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!”\n\nHe walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some\ndistraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A new\noverwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him\nevery moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for\neverything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.\nAll who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their\nmovements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he\nmight have spat at him or bitten him....\n\nHe stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near\nthe bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. “Why, he lives here, in that house,”\n he thought, “why, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here\nit’s the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know, though;\nhave I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Never\nmind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the\nday _after_; well, and so I will! Besides I really cannot go further\nnow.”\n\nHe went up to Razumihin’s room on the fifth floor.\n\nThe latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and\nhe opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each\nother. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on\nhis bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.\n\n“Is it you?” he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a\nbrief pause, he whistled. “As hard up as all that! Why, brother, you’ve\ncut me out!” he added, looking at Raskolnikov’s rags. “Come sit down,\nyou are tired, I’ll be bound.”\n\nAnd when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was\nin even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that his\nvisitor was ill.\n\n“Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?” He began feeling his\npulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.\n\n“Never mind,” he said, “I have come for this: I have no lessons.... I\nwanted,... but I don’t really want lessons....”\n\n“But I say! You are delirious, you know!” Razumihin observed, watching\nhim carefully.\n\n“No, I am not.”\n\nRaskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to\nRazumihin’s, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend\nface to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all\ndisposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the\nwide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at\nhimself as soon as he crossed Razumihin’s threshold.\n\n“Good-bye,” he said abruptly, and walked to the door.\n\n“Stop, stop! You queer fish.”\n\n“I don’t want to,” said the other, again pulling away his hand.\n\n“Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, this\nis... almost insulting! I won’t let you go like that.”\n\n“Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could\nhelp... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone--cleverer, I\nmean, and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear?\nNothing at all... no one’s services... no one’s sympathy. I am by\nmyself... alone. Come, that’s enough. Leave me alone.”\n\n“Stay a minute, you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As you like for all\nI care. I have no lessons, do you see, and I don’t care about that, but\nthere’s a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson.\nI would not exchange him for five lessons. He’s doing publishing of a\nkind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they\nhave! The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that I\nwas a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am!\nNow he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of\nanything, but, of course, I encourage him. Here are two signatures of\nthe German text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses\nthe question, ‘Is woman a human being?’ And, of course, triumphantly\nproves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a\ncontribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand\nthese two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous\ntitle half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He\npays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles\nfor the job, and I’ve had six already in advance. When we have finished\nthis, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of\nthe dullest scandals out of the second part of _Les Confessions_ we have\nmarked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was\na kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I don’t contradict him, hang him!\nWell, would you like to do the second signature of ‘_Is woman a human\nbeing?_’ If you would, take the German and pens and paper--all those\nare provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in\nadvance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share.\nAnd when you have finished the signature there will be another three\nroubles for you. And please don’t think I am doing you a service; quite\nthe contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you could help me; to\nbegin with, I am weak in spelling, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly\nadrift in German, so that I make it up as I go along for the most part.\nThe only comfort is, that it’s bound to be a change for the better.\nThough who can tell, maybe it’s sometimes for the worse. Will you take\nit?”\n\nRaskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roubles\nand without a word went out. Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment.\nBut when Raskolnikov was in the next street, he turned back, mounted the\nstairs to Razumihin’s again and laying on the table the German article\nand the three roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word.\n\n“Are you raving, or what?” Razumihin shouted, roused to fury at last.\n“What farce is this? You’ll drive me crazy too... what did you come to\nsee me for, damn you?”\n\n“I don’t want... translation,” muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs.\n\n“Then what the devil do you want?” shouted Razumihin from above.\nRaskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence.\n\n“Hey, there! Where are you living?”\n\nNo answer.\n\n“Well, confound you then!”\n\nBut Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On the Nikolaevsky\nBridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant\nincident. A coachman, after shouting at him two or three times, gave him\na violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under\nhis horses’ hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the\nrailing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle\nof the bridge in the traffic). He angrily clenched and ground his teeth.\nHe heard laughter, of course.\n\n“Serves him right!”\n\n“A pickpocket I dare say.”\n\n“Pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the wheels on\npurpose; and you have to answer for him.”\n\n“It’s a regular profession, that’s what it is.”\n\nBut while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered\nafter the retreating carriage, and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt\nsomeone thrust money into his hand. He looked. It was an elderly woman\nin a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter,\nwearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol.\n\n“Take it, my good man, in Christ’s name.”\n\nHe took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty copecks. From\nhis dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar\nasking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks he\ndoubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him.\n\nHe closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and\nturned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace. The sky was without\na cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the\nNeva. The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the\nbridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight,\nand in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.\nThe pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one\nuneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely. He stood\nstill, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was\nespecially familiar to him. When he was attending the university, he had\nhundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot,\ngazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at\na vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely\ncold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered\nevery time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting\nhimself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled\nthose old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was\nno mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and\ngrotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before,\nas though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be\ninterested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...\nso short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his\nheart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him\nnow--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories,\nhis old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all.... He\nfelt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing\nfrom his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he\nsuddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his\nhand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into\nthe water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him, he had cut\nhimself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.\n\nEvening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been\nwalking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember.\nUndressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the\nsofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion....\n\nIt was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God, what a\nscream! Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears,\nblows and curses he had never heard.\n\nHe could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. In terror he\nsat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing\nand cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement\nhe caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and\nwailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make\nout what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be\nbeaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of\nher assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost\na croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly\nand indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov\ntrembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.\nIlya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her,\nbanging her head against the steps--that’s clear, that can be told\nfrom the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the world\ntopsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys\nand all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors\nbanging. “But why, why, and how could it be?” he repeated, thinking\nseriously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! And\nthey would come to him then next, “for no doubt... it’s all about\nthat... about yesterday.... Good God!” He would have fastened his door\nwith the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it would\nbe useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed\nhim.... But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,\nbegan gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya\nPetrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he,\ntoo, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard. “Can he have\ngone away? Good Lord!” Yes, and now the landlady is going too, still\nweeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd was\ngoing from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling\nto one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a\nwhisper. There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates\nof the block. “But, good God, how could it be! And why, why had he come\nhere!”\n\nRaskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes. He\nlay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of\ninfinite terror as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a bright\nlight flashed into his room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate\nof soup. Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not\nasleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she\nhad brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.\n\n“You’ve eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You’ve been trudging\nabout all day, and you’re shaking with fever.”\n\n“Nastasya... what were they beating the landlady for?”\n\nShe looked intently at him.\n\n“Who beat the landlady?”\n\n“Just now... half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant\nsuperintendent, on the stairs.... Why was he ill-treating her like that,\nand... why was he here?”\n\nNastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted a\nlong time. He felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes.\n\n“Nastasya, why don’t you speak?” he said timidly at last in a weak\nvoice.\n\n“It’s the blood,” she answered at last softly, as though speaking to\nherself.\n\n“Blood? What blood?” he muttered, growing white and turning towards the\nwall.\n\nNastasya still looked at him without speaking.\n\n“Nobody has been beating the landlady,” she declared at last in a firm,\nresolute voice.\n\nHe gazed at her, hardly able to breathe.\n\n“I heard it myself.... I was not asleep... I was sitting up,” he\nsaid still more timidly. “I listened a long while. The assistant\nsuperintendent came.... Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the\nflats.”\n\n“No one has been here. That’s the blood crying in your ears. When\nthere’s no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you begin fancying\nthings.... Will you eat something?”\n\nHe made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him, watching him.\n\n“Give me something to drink... Nastasya.”\n\nShe went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water.\nHe remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling\nsome on his neck. Then followed forgetfulness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nHe was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he\nwas in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.\nHe remembered a great deal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though\nthere were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him away\nsomewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about\nhim. Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid\nof him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him;\nthey threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked\nat him. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguished\nanother person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he could\nnot remember who he was, and this fretted him, even made him cry.\nSometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other times\nit all seemed part of the same day. But of _that_--of _that_ he had\nno recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten\nsomething he ought to remember. He worried and tormented himself trying\nto remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerable\nterror. Then he struggled to get up, would have run away, but someone\nalways prevented him by force, and he sank back into impotence and\nforgetfulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.\n\nIt happened at ten o’clock in the morning. On fine days the sun shone\ninto the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the right\nwall and the corner near the door. Nastasya was standing beside him\nwith another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him\nvery inquisitively. He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full,\nshort-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The landlady was\npeeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov sat up.\n\n“Who is this, Nastasya?” he asked, pointing to the young man.\n\n“I say, he’s himself again!” she said.\n\n“He is himself,” echoed the man.\n\nConcluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed the\ndoor and disappeared. She was always shy and dreaded conversations or\ndiscussions. She was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat\nand buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and\nlaziness, and absurdly bashful.\n\n“Who... are you?” he went on, addressing the man. But at that moment\nthe door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he was so tall,\nRazumihin came in.\n\n“What a cabin it is!” he cried. “I am always knocking my head. You call\nthis a lodging! So you are conscious, brother? I’ve just heard the news\nfrom Pashenka.”\n\n“He has just come to,” said Nastasya.\n\n“Just come to,” echoed the man again, with a smile.\n\n“And who are you?” Razumihin asked, suddenly addressing him. “My name is\nVrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, as I am always called, but\nVrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who are\nyou?”\n\n“I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, and\nI’ve come on business.”\n\n“Please sit down.” Razumihin seated himself on the other side of the\ntable. “It’s a good thing you’ve come to, brother,” he went on to\nRaskolnikov. “For the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk\nanything. We had to give you tea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to see\nyou twice. You remember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said at\nonce it was nothing serious--something seemed to have gone to your head.\nSome nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he says you have not\nhad enough beer and radish, but it’s nothing much, it will pass and you\nwill be all right. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite a\nname. Come, I won’t keep you,” he said, addressing the man again. “Will\nyou explain what you want? You must know, Rodya, this is the second time\nthey have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and I\ntalked to him. Who was it came before?”\n\n“That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you please,\nsir. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our office, too.”\n\n“He was more intelligent than you, don’t you think so?”\n\n“Yes, indeed, sir, he is of more weight than I am.”\n\n“Quite so; go on.”\n\n“At your mamma’s request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, of whom\nI presume you have heard more than once, a remittance is sent to you\nfrom our office,” the man began, addressing Raskolnikov. “If you are in\nan intelligible condition, I’ve thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as\nSemyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mamma’s\nrequest instructions to that effect, as on previous occasions. Do you\nknow him, sir?”\n\n“Yes, I remember... Vahrushin,” Raskolnikov said dreamily.\n\n“You hear, he knows Vahrushin,” cried Razumihin. “He is in ‘an\nintelligible condition’! And I see you are an intelligent man too. Well,\nit’s always pleasant to hear words of wisdom.”\n\n“That’s the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. And at the request\nof your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the\nsame manner through him, he did not refuse this time also, and sent\ninstructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you\nthirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come.”\n\n“That ‘hoping for better to come’ is the best thing you’ve said, though\n‘your mamma’ is not bad either. Come then, what do you say? Is he fully\nconscious, eh?”\n\n“That’s all right. If only he can sign this little paper.”\n\n“He can scrawl his name. Have you got the book?”\n\n“Yes, here’s the book.”\n\n“Give it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. I’ll hold you. Take the pen and\nscribble ‘Raskolnikov’ for him. For just now, brother, money is sweeter\nto us than treacle.”\n\n“I don’t want it,” said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen.\n\n“Not want it?”\n\n“I won’t sign it.”\n\n“How the devil can you do without signing it?”\n\n“I don’t want... the money.”\n\n“Don’t want the money! Come, brother, that’s nonsense, I bear witness.\nDon’t trouble, please, it’s only that he is on his travels again. But\nthat’s pretty common with him at all times though.... You are a man of\njudgment and we will take him in hand, that is, more simply, take his\nhand and he will sign it. Here.”\n\n“But I can come another time.”\n\n“No, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of judgment.... Now,\nRodya, don’t keep your visitor, you see he is waiting,” and he made\nready to hold Raskolnikov’s hand in earnest.\n\n“Stop, I’ll do it alone,” said the latter, taking the pen and signing\nhis name.\n\nThe messenger took out the money and went away.\n\n“Bravo! And now, brother, are you hungry?”\n\n“Yes,” answered Raskolnikov.\n\n“Is there any soup?”\n\n“Some of yesterday’s,” answered Nastasya, who was still standing there.\n\n“With potatoes and rice in it?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I know it by heart. Bring soup and give us some tea.”\n\n“Very well.”\n\nRaskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull,\nunreasoning terror. He made up his mind to keep quiet and see what\nwould happen. “I believe I am not wandering. I believe it’s reality,” he\nthought.\n\nIn a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, and announced\nthat the tea would be ready directly. With the soup she brought two\nspoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on. The\ntable was set as it had not been for a long time. The cloth was clean.\n\n“It would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send us\nup a couple of bottles of beer. We could empty them.”\n\n“Well, you are a cool hand,” muttered Nastasya, and she departed to\ncarry out his orders.\n\nRaskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. Meanwhile\nRazumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put his\nleft arm round Raskolnikov’s head, although he was able to sit up, and\nwith his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that\nit might not burn him. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikov\nswallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third. But after\ngiving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumihin suddenly stopped, and\nsaid that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more.\n\nNastasya came in with two bottles of beer.\n\n“And will you have tea?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Cut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on\nwithout the faculty. But here is the beer!” He moved back to his chair,\npulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he\nhad not touched food for three days.\n\n“I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now,” he\nmumbled with his mouth full of beef, “and it’s all Pashenka, your dear\nlittle landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me. I\ndon’t ask for it, but, of course, I don’t object. And here’s Nastasya\nwith the tea. She is a quick girl. Nastasya, my dear, won’t you have\nsome beer?”\n\n“Get along with your nonsense!”\n\n“A cup of tea, then?”\n\n“A cup of tea, maybe.”\n\n“Pour it out. Stay, I’ll pour it out myself. Sit down.”\n\nHe poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again. As\nbefore, he put his left arm round the sick man’s head, raised him up\nand gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and\nearnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective\nmeans towards his friend’s recovery. Raskolnikov said nothing and made\nno resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa\nwithout support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but\neven perhaps could have walked about. But from some queer, almost\nanimal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying\nlow for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession\nof his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.\nYet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen\nspoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away\ncapriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actually real\npillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed\nthat, too, and took note of it.\n\n“Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him some\nraspberry tea,” said Razumihin, going back to his chair and attacking\nhis soup and beer again.\n\n“And where is she to get raspberries for you?” asked Nastasya, balancing\na saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of\nsugar.\n\n“She’ll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts of things\nhave been happening while you have been laid up. When you decamped in\nthat rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that I\nresolved to find you out and punish you. I set to work that very day.\nHow I ran about making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had\nforgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not know\nit; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at the\nFive Corners, Harlamov’s house. I kept trying to find that Harlamov’s\nhouse, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamov’s, but\nBuch’s. How one muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper, and I\nwent on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy, in\ntwo minutes they looked you up! Your name is down there.”\n\n“My name!”\n\n“I should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could not find while\nI was there. Well, it’s a long story. But as soon as I did land on this\nplace, I soon got to know all your affairs--all, all, brother, I know\neverything; Nastasya here will tell you. I made the acquaintance of\nNikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house-porter and Mr.\nZametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office,\nand, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here knows....”\n\n“He’s got round her,” Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly.\n\n“Why don’t you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Nikiforovna?”\n\n“You are a one!” Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a giggle. “I am\nnot Nikiforovna, but Petrovna,” she added suddenly, recovering from her\nmirth.\n\n“I’ll make a note of it. Well, brother, to make a long story short,\nI was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant\ninfluences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day. I had not\nexpected, brother, to find her so... prepossessing. Eh, what do you\nthink?”\n\nRaskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him,\nfull of alarm.\n\n“And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect,” Razumihin went\non, not at all embarrassed by his silence.\n\n“Ah, the sly dog!” Nastasya shrieked again. This conversation afforded\nher unspeakable delight.\n\n“It’s a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right way\nat first. You ought to have approached her differently. She is, so\nto speak, a most unaccountable character. But we will talk about her\ncharacter later.... How could you let things come to such a pass that\nshe gave up sending you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have been\nmad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when her daughter,\nNatalya Yegorovna, was alive?... I know all about it! But I see that’s\na delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me. But, talking of\nfoolishness, do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as\nyou would think at first sight?”\n\n“No,” mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling that it was better\nto keep up the conversation.\n\n“She isn’t, is she?” cried Razumihin, delighted to get an answer out\nof him. “But she is not very clever either, eh? She is essentially,\nessentially an unaccountable character! I am sometimes quite at a loss,\nI assure you.... She must be forty; she says she is thirty-six, and\nof course she has every right to say so. But I swear I judge her\nintellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a\nsort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!\nI don’t understand it! Well, that’s all nonsense. Only, seeing that you\nare not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, and\nthat through the young lady’s death she has no need to treat you as\na relation, she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and\ndropped all your old relations with her, she planned to get rid of you.\nAnd she’s been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose\nthe I O U, for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay.”\n\n“It was base of me to say that.... My mother herself is almost\na beggar... and I told a lie to keep my lodging... and be fed,”\n Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.\n\n“Yes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at that point\nMr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man. Pashenka would never have\nthought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but\nthe business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the\nquestion, ‘Is there any hope of realising the I O U?’ Answer: there is,\nbecause he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and\ntwenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister,\ntoo, who would go into bondage for his sake. That’s what he was building\nupon.... Why do you start? I know all the ins and outs of your affairs\nnow, my dear boy--it’s not for nothing that you were so open with\nPashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and I say all this as\na friend.... But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is\nopen; and a business man ‘listens and goes on eating’ you up. Well,\nthen she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov, and without\nhesitation he made a formal demand for payment. When I heard of all this\nI wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that time\nharmony reigned between me and Pashenka, and I insisted on stopping\nthe whole affair, engaging that you would pay. I went security for you,\nbrother. Do you understand? We called Tchebarov, flung him ten\nroubles and got the I O U back from him, and here I have the honour of\npresenting it to you. She trusts your word now. Here, take it, you see I\nhave torn it.”\n\nRazumihin put the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked at him and\nturned to the wall without uttering a word. Even Razumihin felt a\ntwinge.\n\n“I see, brother,” he said a moment later, “that I have been playing the\nfool again. I thought I should amuse you with my chatter, and I believe\nI have only made you cross.”\n\n“Was it you I did not recognise when I was delirious?” Raskolnikov\nasked, after a moment’s pause without turning his head.\n\n“Yes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I brought\nZametov one day.”\n\n“Zametov? The head clerk? What for?” Raskolnikov turned round quickly\nand fixed his eyes on Razumihin.\n\n“What’s the matter with you?... What are you upset about? He wanted to\nmake your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you.... How\ncould I have found out so much except from him? He is a capital\nfellow, brother, first-rate... in his own way, of course. Now we are\nfriends--see each other almost every day. I have moved into this part,\nyou know. I have only just moved. I’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna\nonce or twice.... Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna?\n\n“Did I say anything in delirium?”\n\n“I should think so! You were beside yourself.”\n\n“What did I rave about?”\n\n“What next? What did you rave about? What people do rave about.... Well,\nbrother, now I must not lose time. To work.” He got up from the table\nand took up his cap.\n\n“What did I rave about?”\n\n“How he keeps on! Are you afraid of having let out some secret? Don’t\nworry yourself; you said nothing about a countess. But you said a lot\nabout a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about Krestovsky\nIsland, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the\nassistant superintendent. And another thing that was of special interest\nto you was your own sock. You whined, ‘Give me my sock.’ Zametov\nhunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented,\nring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag. And only then were you\ncomforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched\nthing in your hand; we could not get it from you. It is most likely\nsomewhere under your quilt at this moment. And then you asked so\npiteously for fringe for your trousers. We tried to find out what sort\nof fringe, but we could not make it out. Now to business! Here are\nthirty-five roubles; I take ten of them, and shall give you an account\nof them in an hour or two. I will let Zossimov know at the same time,\nthough he ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve. And\nyou, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see whether he\nwants a drink or anything else. And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted\nmyself. Good-bye!”\n\n“He calls her Pashenka! Ah, he’s a deep one!” said Nastasya as he went\nout; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist\nrunning downstairs after him. She was very eager to hear what he would\nsay to the landlady. She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.\n\nNo sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the\nbedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman. With burning, twitching\nimpatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to\nwork. But to what work? Now, as though to spite him, it eluded him.\n\n“Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not? What\nif they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while I am laid up,\nand then they will come in and tell me that it’s been discovered long\nago and that they have only... What am I to do now? That’s what I’ve\nforgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I remembered\na minute ago.”\n\nHe stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment\nabout him; he walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not\nwhat he wanted. Suddenly, as though recalling something, he rushed to\nthe corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it,\nput his hand into the hole, fumbled--but that was not it. He went to the\nstove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of\nhis trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as\nhe had thrown them. No one had looked, then! Then he remembered the sock\nabout which Razumihin had just been telling him. Yes, there it lay on\nthe sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime that\nZametov could not have seen anything on it.\n\n“Bah, Zametov! The police office! And why am I sent for to the police\noffice? Where’s the notice? Bah! I am mixing it up; that was then. I\nlooked at my sock then, too, but now... now I have been ill. But\nwhat did Zametov come for? Why did Razumihin bring him?” he muttered,\nhelplessly sitting on the sofa again. “What does it mean? Am I still in\ndelirium, or is it real? I believe it is real.... Ah, I remember; I must\nescape! Make haste to escape. Yes, I must, I must escape! Yes... but\nwhere? And where are my clothes? I’ve no boots. They’ve taken them away!\nThey’ve hidden them! I understand! Ah, here is my coat--they passed that\nover! And here is money on the table, thank God! And here’s the I O U...\nI’ll take the money and go and take another lodging. They won’t find\nme!... Yes, but the address bureau? They’ll find me, Razumihin will find\nme. Better escape altogether... far away... to America, and let them\ndo their worst! And take the I O U... it would be of use there.... What\nelse shall I take? They think I am ill! They don’t know that I can walk,\nha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about it! If\nonly I could get downstairs! And what if they have set a watch\nthere--policemen! What’s this tea? Ah, and here is beer left, half a\nbottle, cold!”\n\nHe snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and\ngulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast.\nBut in another minute the beer had gone to his head, and a faint and\neven pleasant shiver ran down his spine. He lay down and pulled the\nquilt over him. His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more\ndisconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him. With\na sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped more\nclosely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old,\nragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing\nsleep.\n\nHe woke up, hearing someone come in. He opened his eyes and saw\nRazumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or\nnot. Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him, as though\ntrying to recall something.\n\n“Ah, you are not asleep! Here I am! Nastasya, bring in the parcel!”\n Razumihin shouted down the stairs. “You shall have the account\ndirectly.”\n\n“What time is it?” asked Raskolnikov, looking round uneasily.\n\n“Yes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it’s almost evening, it will be six\no’clock directly. You have slept more than six hours.”\n\n“Good heavens! Have I?”\n\n“And why not? It will do you good. What’s the hurry? A tryst, is it?\nWe’ve all time before us. I’ve been waiting for the last three hours for\nyou; I’ve been up twice and found you asleep. I’ve called on Zossimov\ntwice; not at home, only fancy! But no matter, he will turn up. And\nI’ve been out on my own business, too. You know I’ve been moving to-day,\nmoving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now. But that’s\nno matter, to business. Give me the parcel, Nastasya. We will open it\ndirectly. And how do you feel now, brother?”\n\n“I am quite well, I am not ill. Razumihin, have you been here long?”\n\n“I tell you I’ve been waiting for the last three hours.”\n\n“No, before.”\n\n“How do you mean?”\n\n“How long have you been coming here?”\n\n“Why I told you all about it this morning. Don’t you remember?”\n\nRaskolnikov pondered. The morning seemed like a dream to him. He could\nnot remember alone, and looked inquiringly at Razumihin.\n\n“Hm!” said the latter, “he has forgotten. I fancied then that you were\nnot quite yourself. Now you are better for your sleep.... You really\nlook much better. First-rate! Well, to business. Look here, my dear\nboy.”\n\nHe began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him.\n\n“Believe me, brother, this is something specially near my heart. For we\nmust make a man of you. Let’s begin from the top. Do you see this\ncap?” he said, taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and\nordinary cap. “Let me try it on.”\n\n“Presently, afterwards,” said Raskolnikov, waving it off pettishly.\n\n“Come, Rodya, my boy, don’t oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and\nI shan’t sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, without measure.\nJust right!” he cried triumphantly, fitting it on, “just your size! A\nproper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in\nits own way. Tolstyakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off\nhis pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other\npeople wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from slavish\npoliteness, but it’s simply because he is ashamed of his bird’s nest;\nhe is such a boastful fellow! Look, Nastasya, here are two specimens of\nheadgear: this Palmerston”--he took from the corner Raskolnikov’s old,\nbattered hat, which for some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston--“or\nthis jewel! Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid for it,\nNastasya!” he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskolnikov did not\nspeak.\n\n“Twenty copecks, no more, I dare say,” answered Nastasya.\n\n“Twenty copecks, silly!” he cried, offended. “Why, nowadays you would\ncost more than that--eighty copecks! And that only because it has been\nworn. And it’s bought on condition that when’s it’s worn out, they will\ngive you another next year. Yes, on my word! Well, now let us pass to\nthe United States of America, as they called them at school. I assure\nyou I am proud of these breeches,” and he exhibited to Raskolnikov a\npair of light, summer trousers of grey woollen material. “No holes, no\nspots, and quite respectable, although a little worn; and a waistcoat\nto match, quite in the fashion. And its being worn really is an\nimprovement, it’s softer, smoother.... You see, Rodya, to my thinking,\nthe great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the\nseasons; if you don’t insist on having asparagus in January, you keep\nyour money in your purse; and it’s the same with this purchase. It’s\nsummer now, so I’ve been buying summer things--warmer materials will be\nwanted for autumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case...\nespecially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of\ncoherence if not your higher standard of luxury. Come, price them! What\ndo you say? Two roubles twenty-five copecks! And remember the condition:\nif you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing! They only\ndo business on that system at Fedyaev’s; if you’ve bought a thing once,\nyou are satisfied for life, for you will never go there again of your\nown free will. Now for the boots. What do you say? You see that they are\na bit worn, but they’ll last a couple of months, for it’s foreign work\nand foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last\nweek--he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of cash.\nPrice--a rouble and a half. A bargain?”\n\n“But perhaps they won’t fit,” observed Nastasya.\n\n“Not fit? Just look!” and he pulled out of his pocket Raskolnikov’s\nold, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud. “I did not go\nempty-handed--they took the size from this monster. We all did our best.\nAnd as to your linen, your landlady has seen to that. Here, to begin\nwith are three shirts, hempen but with a fashionable front.... Well\nnow then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the\nsuit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for the\nboots--for, you see, they are very good--and that makes four roubles\nfifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they were\nbought in the lot--which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks.\nForty-five copecks change in coppers. Will you take it? And so, Rodya,\nyou are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will\nserve, and even has a style of its own. That comes from getting one’s\nclothes from Sharmer’s! As for your socks and other things, I leave them\nto you; we’ve twenty-five roubles left. And as for Pashenka and paying\nfor your lodging, don’t you worry. I tell you she’ll trust you for\nanything. And now, brother, let me change your linen, for I daresay you\nwill throw off your illness with your shirt.”\n\n“Let me be! I don’t want to!” Raskolnikov waved him off. He had listened\nwith disgust to Razumihin’s efforts to be playful about his purchases.\n\n“Come, brother, don’t tell me I’ve been trudging around for nothing,”\n Razumihin insisted. “Nastasya, don’t be bashful, but help me--that’s\nit,” and in spite of Raskolnikov’s resistance he changed his linen. The\nlatter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing.\n\n“It will be long before I get rid of them,” he thought. “What money was\nall that bought with?” he asked at last, gazing at the wall.\n\n“Money? Why, your own, what the messenger brought from Vahrushin, your\nmother sent it. Have you forgotten that, too?”\n\n“I remember now,” said Raskolnikov after a long, sullen silence.\nRazumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy.\n\nThe door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance seemed familiar\nto Raskolnikov came in.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nZossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face\nand straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on\nhis fat finger. He was twenty-seven. He had on a light grey fashionable\nloose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose,\nfashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his\nwatch-chain was massive. In manner he was slow and, as it were,\nnonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made\nefforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at every\ninstant. All his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was clever\nat his work.\n\n“I’ve been to you twice to-day, brother. You see, he’s come to himself,”\n cried Razumihin.\n\n“I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?” said Zossimov to\nRaskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the\nsofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could.\n\n“He is still depressed,” Razumihin went on. “We’ve just changed his\nlinen and he almost cried.”\n\n“That’s very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish\nit.... His pulse is first-rate. Is your head still aching, eh?”\n\n“I am well, I am perfectly well!” Raskolnikov declared positively\nand irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with\nglittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to\nthe wall. Zossimov watched him intently.\n\n“Very good.... Going on all right,” he said lazily. “Has he eaten\nanything?”\n\nThey told him, and asked what he might have.\n\n“He may have anything... soup, tea... mushrooms and cucumbers, of\ncourse, you must not give him; he’d better not have meat either, and...\nbut no need to tell you that!” Razumihin and he looked at each\nother. “No more medicine or anything. I’ll look at him again to-morrow.\nPerhaps, to-day even... but never mind...”\n\n“To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk,” said Razumihin. “We are\ngoing to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Cristal.”\n\n“I would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I don’t know... a little,\nmaybe... but we’ll see.”\n\n“Ach, what a nuisance! I’ve got a house-warming party to-night; it’s\nonly a step from here. Couldn’t he come? He could lie on the sofa. You\nare coming?” Razumihin said to Zossimov. “Don’t forget, you promised.”\n\n“All right, only rather later. What are you going to do?”\n\n“Oh, nothing--tea, vodka, herrings. There will be a pie... just our\nfriends.”\n\n“And who?”\n\n“All neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, and\nhe is new too--he only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to some\nbusiness of his. We meet once in five years.”\n\n“What is he?”\n\n“He’s been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets a\nlittle pension. He is sixty-five--not worth talking about.... But I\nam fond of him. Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the Investigation\nDepartment here... But you know him.”\n\n“Is he a relation of yours, too?”\n\n“A very distant one. But why are you scowling? Because you quarrelled\nonce, won’t you come then?”\n\n“I don’t care a damn for him.”\n\n“So much the better. Well, there will be some students, a teacher, a\ngovernment clerk, a musician, an officer and Zametov.”\n\n“Do tell me, please, what you or he”--Zossimov nodded at\nRaskolnikov--“can have in common with this Zametov?”\n\n“Oh, you particular gentleman! Principles! You are worked by principles,\nas it were by springs; you won’t venture to turn round on your own\naccount. If a man is a nice fellow, that’s the only principle I go upon.\nZametov is a delightful person.”\n\n“Though he does take bribes.”\n\n“Well, he does! and what of it? I don’t care if he does take bribes,”\n Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. “I don’t praise him for\ntaking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if one\nlooks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left? Why, I am sure\nI shouldn’t be worth a baked onion myself... perhaps with you thrown\nin.”\n\n“That’s too little; I’d give two for you.”\n\n“And I wouldn’t give more than one for you. No more of your jokes!\nZametov is no more than a boy. I can pull his hair and one must draw him\nnot repel him. You’ll never improve a man by repelling him, especially\na boy. One has to be twice as careful with a boy. Oh, you progressive\ndullards! You don’t understand. You harm yourselves running another man\ndown.... But if you want to know, we really have something in common.”\n\n“I should like to know what.”\n\n“Why, it’s all about a house-painter.... We are getting him out of\na mess! Though indeed there’s nothing to fear now. The matter is\nabsolutely self-evident. We only put on steam.”\n\n“A painter?”\n\n“Why, haven’t I told you about it? I only told you the beginning then\nabout the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman. Well, the painter is mixed\nup in it...”\n\n“Oh, I heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it...\npartly... for one reason.... I read about it in the papers, too....”\n\n“Lizaveta was murdered, too,” Nastasya blurted out, suddenly addressing\nRaskolnikov. She remained in the room all the time, standing by the door\nlistening.\n\n“Lizaveta,” murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly.\n\n“Lizaveta, who sold old clothes. Didn’t you know her? She used to come\nhere. She mended a shirt for you, too.”\n\nRaskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he\npicked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began\nexamining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the\npetals and how many lines on them. He felt his arms and legs as lifeless\nas though they had been cut off. He did not attempt to move, but stared\nobstinately at the flower.\n\n“But what about the painter?” Zossimov interrupted Nastasya’s chatter\nwith marked displeasure. She sighed and was silent.\n\n“Why, he was accused of the murder,” Razumihin went on hotly.\n\n“Was there evidence against him then?”\n\n“Evidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and that’s what we\nhave to prove. It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch and\nPestryakov, at first. Foo! how stupidly it’s all done, it makes one\nsick, though it’s not one’s business! Pestryakov may be coming\nto-night.... By the way, Rodya, you’ve heard about the business already;\nit happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the\npolice office while they were talking about it.”\n\nZossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov. He did not stir.\n\n“But I say, Razumihin, I wonder at you. What a busybody you are!”\n Zossimov observed.\n\n“Maybe I am, but we will get him off anyway,” shouted Razumihin,\nbringing his fist down on the table. “What’s the most offensive is not\ntheir lying--one can always forgive lying--lying is a delightful thing,\nfor it leads to truth--what is offensive is that they lie and worship\ntheir own lying.... I respect Porfiry, but... What threw them out at\nfirst? The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter\nit was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the\nmurderers--that was their logic!”\n\n“But don’t excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could not\nhelp that.... And, by the way, I’ve met that man Koch. He used to buy\nunredeemed pledges from the old woman? Eh?”\n\n“Yes, he is a swindler. He buys up bad debts, too. He makes a profession\nof it. But enough of him! Do you know what makes me angry? It’s their\nsickening rotten, petrified routine.... And this case might be the means\nof introducing a new method. One can show from the psychological data\nalone how to get on the track of the real man. ‘We have facts,’ they\nsay. But facts are not everything--at least half the business lies in\nhow you interpret them!”\n\n“Can you interpret them, then?”\n\n“Anyway, one can’t hold one’s tongue when one has a feeling, a tangible\nfeeling, that one might be a help if only.... Eh! Do you know the\ndetails of the case?”\n\n“I am waiting to hear about the painter.”\n\n“Oh, yes! Well, here’s the story. Early on the third day after the\nmurder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov--though they\naccounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--an\nunexpected fact turned up. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a\ndram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller’s\ncase containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. ‘The\nday before yesterday, just after eight o’clock’--mark the day and the\nhour!--‘a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me\nalready that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and\nasked me to give him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got\nthem, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask him\nanything more.’ I am telling you Dushkin’s story. ‘I gave him a note’--a\nrouble that is--‘for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would\nwith another. It would all come to the same thing--he’d spend it on\ndrink, so the thing had better be with me. The further you hide it\nthe quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any\nrumours, I’ll take it to the police.’ Of course, that’s all taradiddle;\nhe lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, he is a pawnbroker and\na receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a\nthirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police. He was simply\nafraid. But no matter, to return to Dushkin’s story. ‘I’ve known\nthis peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same\nprovince and district of Zaraïsk, we are both Ryazan men. And though\nNikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in that\nhouse, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too.\nAs soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses,\ntook his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him then.\nAnd the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and\nher sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. I knew them, and I felt\nsuspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman\nlent money on pledges. I went to the house, and began to make careful\ninquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked, “Is\nNikolay here?” Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; he\nhad come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes,\nand went out again. Dmitri didn’t see him again and is finishing the\njob alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on\nthe second floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word to\nanyone’--that’s Dushkin’s tale--‘but I found out what I could about\nthe murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever. And at eight\no’clock this morning’--that was the third day, you understand--‘I saw\nNikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he could\nunderstand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and did not\nspeak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep\non a bench and our two boys. “Have you seen Dmitri?” said I. “No, I\nhaven’t,” said he. “And you’ve not been here either?” “Not since the day\nbefore yesterday,” said he. “And where did you sleep last night?”\n “In Peski, with the Kolomensky men.” “And where did you get those\near-rings?” I asked. “I found them in the street,” and the way he said\nit was a bit queer; he did not look at me. “Did you hear what happened\nthat very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?” said I.\n“No,” said he, “I had not heard,” and all the while he was listening,\nhis eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk. I\ntold him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up. I wanted\nto keep him. “Wait a bit, Nikolay,” said I, “won’t you have a drink?”\n And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the\nbar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.\nI have not seen him since. Then my doubts were at an end--it was his\ndoing, as clear as could be....’”\n\n“I should think so,” said Zossimov.\n\n“Wait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay;\nthey detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested;\nthe Kolomensky men also were turned inside out. And the day before\nyesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He\nhad gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram\nfor it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards the woman went\nto the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable\nadjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a\nblock of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman\nscreeched her hardest; people ran in. ‘So that’s what you are up to!’\n‘Take me,’ he says, ‘to such-and-such a police officer; I’ll confess\neverything.’ Well, they took him to that police station--that is\nhere--with a suitable escort. So they asked him this and that, how old\nhe is, ‘twenty-two,’ and so on. At the question, ‘When you were working\nwith Dmitri, didn’t you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a\ntime?’--answer: ‘To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did\nnot notice them.’ ‘And didn’t you hear anything, any noise, and so on?’\n‘We heard nothing special.’ ‘And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same\nday Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?’ ‘I\nnever knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy\nPavlovitch the day before yesterday.’ ‘And where did you find the\near-rings?’ ‘I found them on the pavement.’ ‘Why didn’t you go to work\nwith Dmitri the other day?’ ‘Because I was drinking.’ ‘And where were\nyou drinking?’ ‘Oh, in such-and-such a place.’ ‘Why did you run away\nfrom Dushkin’s?’ ‘Because I was awfully frightened.’ ‘What were\nyou frightened of?’ ‘That I should be accused.’ ‘How could you be\nfrightened, if you felt free from guilt?’ Now, Zossimov, you may not\nbelieve me, that question was put literally in those words. I know it\nfor a fact, it was repeated to me exactly! What do you say to that?”\n\n“Well, anyway, there’s the evidence.”\n\n“I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question,\nof their own idea of themselves. Well, so they squeezed and squeezed\nhim and he confessed: ‘I did not find it in the street, but in the flat\nwhere I was painting with Dmitri.’ ‘And how was that?’ ‘Why, Dmitri and\nI were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and\nDmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off and I after him.\nI ran after him, shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs I\nran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemen\nwere there I don’t remember. And the porter swore at me, and the other\nporter swore, too, and the porter’s wife came out, and swore at us, too;\nand a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he swore at us,\ntoo, for Dmitri and I lay right across the way. I got hold of Dmitri’s\nhair and knocked him down and began beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught\nme by the hair and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper\nbut in a friendly way, for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and ran into\nthe street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and went back\nto the flat alone; I had to clear up my things. I began putting them\ntogether, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the\ncorner by the door, I stepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped\nup in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them,\nand in the box were the ear-rings....’”\n\n“Behind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the door?” Raskolnikov\ncried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and he\nslowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand.\n\n“Yes... why? What’s the matter? What’s wrong?” Razumihin, too, got up\nfrom his seat.\n\n“Nothing,” Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall. All were\nsilent for a while.\n\n“He must have waked from a dream,” Razumihin said at last, looking\ninquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his head.\n\n“Well, go on,” said Zossimov. “What next?”\n\n“What next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and\neverything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got\na rouble from him. He told a lie saying he found them in the street, and\nwent off drinking. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder:\n‘I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.’\n‘And why didn’t you come to the police till now?’ ‘I was frightened.’\n‘And why did you try to hang yourself?’ ‘From anxiety.’ ‘What anxiety?’\n‘That I should be accused of it.’ Well, that’s the whole story. And now\nwhat do you suppose they deduced from that?”\n\n“Why, there’s no supposing. There’s a clue, such as it is, a fact. You\nwouldn’t have your painter set free?”\n\n“Now they’ve simply taken him for the murderer. They haven’t a shadow of\ndoubt.”\n\n“That’s nonsense. You are excited. But what about the ear-rings? You\nmust admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old\nwoman’s box have come into Nikolay’s hands, they must have come there\nsomehow. That’s a good deal in such a case.”\n\n“How did they get there? How did they get there?” cried Razumihin.\n“How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has more\nopportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you fail\nto see the character of the man in the whole story? Don’t you see at\nonce that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy\ntruth? They came into his hand precisely as he has told us--he stepped\non the box and picked it up.”\n\n“The holy truth! But didn’t he own himself that he told a lie at first?”\n\n“Listen to me, listen attentively. The porter and Koch and Pestryakov\nand the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who\nwas sitting in the porter’s lodge and the man Kryukov, who had just got\nout of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his\narm, that is eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on\nthe ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri hung on to his\nhair, beating him, too. They lay right across the way, blocking the\nthoroughfare. They were sworn at on all sides while they ‘like children’\n(the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another,\nsquealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing\none another like children, they ran into the street. Now take careful\nnote. The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when they\nfound them! If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken open\nthe boxes, or simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you one\nquestion: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childish\nscuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning,\nrobbery? They’d just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for\nthe bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing\nthat people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they\nrolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention.\nAnd there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!”\n\n“Of course it is strange! It’s impossible, indeed, but...”\n\n“No, brother, no _buts_. And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay’s\nhands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important\npiece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanation\ngiven by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously\nagainst him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him\ninnocent, especially as they are facts that _cannot be denied_. And\ndo you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will\naccept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact--resting\nsimply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively\nbreaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No, they\nwon’t accept it, they certainly won’t, because they found the jewel-case\nand the man tried to hang himself, ‘which he could not have done if he\nhadn’t felt guilty.’ That’s the point, that’s what excites me, you must\nunderstand!”\n\n“Oh, I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; what proof\nis there that the box came from the old woman?”\n\n“That’s been proved,” said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning.\n“Koch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner, who\nproved conclusively that it was his.”\n\n“That’s bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay at the time\nthat Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there no\nevidence about that?”\n\n“Nobody did see him,” Razumihin answered with vexation. “That’s the\nworst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way\nupstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much.\nThey said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going\non in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whether\nthere actually were men at work in it.”\n\n“Hm!... So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating\none another and laughing. That constitutes a strong presumption, but...\nHow do you explain the facts yourself?”\n\n“How do I explain them? What is there to explain? It’s clear. At any\nrate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, and\nthe jewel-case points to it. The real murderer dropped those ear-rings.\nThe murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked\nat the door. Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the\nmurderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way of\nescape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when\nNikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it. He stopped there while the\nporter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of\nhearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri\nand Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry;\npossibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are lots of people going\nin and out. He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when\nhe stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because he\nhad other things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that\nhe did stand there.... That’s how I explain it.”\n\n“Too clever! No, my boy, you’re too clever. That beats everything.”\n\n“But, why, why?”\n\n“Why, because everything fits too well... it’s too melodramatic.”\n\n“A-ach!” Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment the door opened\nand a personage came in who was a stranger to all present.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThis was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance,\nand a cautious and sour countenance. He began by stopping short in the\ndoorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment,\nas though asking himself what sort of place he had come to.\nMistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost\naffronted, he scanned Raskolnikov’s low and narrow “cabin.” With the\nsame amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled,\nunwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then with\nthe same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and\nunshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the\nface without rising from his seat. A constrained silence lasted for a\ncouple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting\ntook place. Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs,\nthat he would get nothing in this “cabin” by attempting to overawe them,\nthe gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity,\nemphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov:\n\n“Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?”\n\nZossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not\nRazumihin anticipated him.\n\n“Here he is lying on the sofa! What do you want?”\n\nThis familiar “what do you want” seemed to cut the ground from the\nfeet of the pompous gentleman. He was turning to Razumihin, but checked\nhimself in time and turned to Zossimov again.\n\n“This is Raskolnikov,” mumbled Zossimov, nodding towards him. Then he\ngave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible. Then he\nlazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold\nwatch in a round hunter’s case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly\nand lazily proceeded to put it back.\n\nRaskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing\npersistently, though without understanding, at the stranger. Now that\nhis face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it\nwas extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just\nundergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack. But\nthe new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder,\nthen suspicion and even alarm. When Zossimov said “This is Raskolnikov”\n he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but\nweak and breaking, voice articulated:\n\n“Yes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?”\n\nThe visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively:\n\n“Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope that my name\nis not wholly unknown to you?”\n\nBut Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed\nblankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard the\nname of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time.\n\n“Is it possible that you can up to the present have received no\ninformation?” asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted.\n\nIn reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his hands\nbehind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A look of dismay came into\nLuzhin’s face. Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively\nthan ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.\n\n“I had presumed and calculated,” he faltered, “that a letter posted more\nthan ten days, if not a fortnight ago...”\n\n“I say, why are you standing in the doorway?” Razumihin interrupted\nsuddenly. “If you’ve something to say, sit down. Nastasya and you are so\ncrowded. Nastasya, make room. Here’s a chair, thread your way in!”\n\nHe moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the\ntable and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the\nvisitor to “thread his way in.” The minute was so chosen that it was\nimpossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying\nand stumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at\nRazumihin.\n\n“No need to be nervous,” the latter blurted out. “Rodya has been ill for\nthe last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and\nhas got an appetite. This is his doctor, who has just had a look at him.\nI am a comrade of Rodya’s, like him, formerly a student, and now I am\nnursing him; so don’t you take any notice of us, but go on with your\nbusiness.”\n\n“Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and\nconversation?” Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov.\n\n“N-no,” mumbled Zossimov; “you may amuse him.” He yawned again.\n\n“He has been conscious a long time, since the morning,” went on\nRazumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature\nthat Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps,\nbecause this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a\nstudent.\n\n“Your mamma,” began Luzhin.\n\n“Hm!” Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin looked at him\ninquiringly.\n\n“That’s all right, go on.”\n\nLuzhin shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning in\nher neighbourhood. On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days to\nelapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fully\nassured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my\nastonishment...”\n\n“I know, I know!” Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation.\n“So you are the _fiancé_? I know, and that’s enough!”\n\nThere was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch’s being offended this time,\nbut he said nothing. He made a violent effort to understand what it all\nmeant. There was a moment’s silence.\n\nMeanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he\nanswered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as\nthough he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something\nnew had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at\nhim. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch’s whole\nappearance, something which seemed to justify the title of “fiancé” so\nunceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far\ntoo much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few\ndays in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation\nof his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding,\nindeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the\nagreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such\ncircumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rôle of\nfiancé. All his clothes were fresh from the tailor’s and were all\nright, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even\nthe stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch\ntreated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The\nexquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale,\nif only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in\nhis hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr\nPetrovitch’s attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade,\nlight thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a\ncravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best\nof it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and even\nhandsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.\nHis dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides,\ngrowing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair,\ntouched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled\nat a hairdresser’s, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair\nusually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.\nIf there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather\ngood-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other\ncauses. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled\nmalignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as\nbefore.\n\nBut Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no\nnotice of their oddities.\n\n“I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,” he began,\nagain breaking the silence with an effort. “If I had been aware of your\nillness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. I\nhave, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention\nother preoccupations which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your\nmamma and sister any minute.”\n\nRaskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed\nsome excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing\nfollowed, he went on:\n\n“... Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their arrival.”\n\n“Where?” asked Raskolnikov weakly.\n\n“Very near here, in Bakaleyev’s house.”\n\n“That’s in Voskresensky,” put in Razumihin. “There are two storeys of\nrooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I’ve been there.”\n\n“Yes, rooms...”\n\n“A disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, what’s more, of doubtful\ncharacter. Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer\npeople living there. And I went there about a scandalous business. It’s\ncheap, though...”\n\n“I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a stranger\nin Petersburg myself,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily. “However, the\ntwo rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time...\nI have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat,” he said,\naddressing Raskolnikov, “and I am having it done up. And meanwhile I am\nmyself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch\nLebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me\nof Bakaleyev’s house, too...”\n\n“Lebeziatnikov?” said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something.\n\n“Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry. Do you\nknow him?”\n\n“Yes... no,” Raskolnikov answered.\n\n“Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his guardian....\nA very nice young man and advanced. I like to meet young people: one\nlearns new things from them.” Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all.\n\n“How do you mean?” asked Razumihin.\n\n“In the most serious and essential matters,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied,\nas though delighted at the question. “You see, it’s ten years since I\nvisited Petersburg. All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in\nthe provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.\nAnd it’s my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the\nyounger generation. And I confess I am delighted...”\n\n“At what?”\n\n“Your question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find\nclearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality...”\n\n“That’s true,” Zossimov let drop.\n\n“Nonsense! There’s no practicality.” Razumihin flew at him.\n“Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from\nheaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from\nall practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting,” he said to\nPyotr Petrovitch, “and desire for good exists, though it’s in a childish\nform, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands.\nAnyway, there’s no practicality. Practicality goes well shod.”\n\n“I don’t agree with you,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident\nenjoyment. “Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes,\nbut one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of\nenthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If little\nhas been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.\nIt’s my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been\naccomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valuable works are\ncirculating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.\nLiterature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have been\nrooted up and turned into ridicule.... In a word, we have cut ourselves\noff irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great\nthing...”\n\n“He’s learnt it by heart to show off!” Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly.\n\n“What?” asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; but he received\nno reply.\n\n“That’s all true,” Zossimov hastened to interpose.\n\n“Isn’t it so?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at Zossimov.\n“You must admit,” he went on, addressing Razumihin with a shade of\ntriumph and superciliousness--he almost added “young man”--“that there\nis an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and\neconomic truth...”\n\n“A commonplace.”\n\n“No, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, ‘love\nthy neighbour,’ what came of it?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on, perhaps with\nexcessive haste. “It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my\nneighbour and we both were left half naked. As a Russian proverb has\nit, ‘Catch several hares and you won’t catch one.’ Science now tells\nus, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on\nself-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly\nand your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private\naffairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--the\nfirmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare\norganised too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for\nmyself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to\npass my neighbour’s getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not\nfrom private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general\nadvance. The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time\nreaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it\nwould seem to want very little wit to perceive it...”\n\n“Excuse me, I’ve very little wit myself,” Razumihin cut in sharply,\n“and so let us drop it. I began this discussion with an object, but I’ve\ngrown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse\noneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that,\nby Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that. You are in a\nhurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don’t blame you,\nthat’s quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort of man you\nare, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive\ncause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything\nthey touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire. That’s\nenough!”\n\n“Excuse me, sir,” said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking with excessive\ndignity. “Do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that I too...”\n\n“Oh, my dear sir... how could I?... Come, that’s enough,” Razumihin\nconcluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous\nconversation.\n\nPyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal. He made up\nhis mind to take leave in another minute or two.\n\n“I trust our acquaintance,” he said, addressing Raskolnikov, “may, upon\nyour recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware,\nbecome closer... Above all, I hope for your return to health...”\n\nRaskolnikov did not even turn his head. Pyotr Petrovitch began getting\nup from his chair.\n\n“One of her customers must have killed her,” Zossimov declared\npositively.\n\n“Not a doubt of it,” replied Razumihin. “Porfiry doesn’t give his\nopinion, but is examining all who have left pledges with her there.”\n\n“Examining them?” Raskolnikov asked aloud.\n\n“Yes. What then?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“How does he get hold of them?” asked Zossimov.\n\n“Koch has given the names of some of them, other names are on the\nwrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves.”\n\n“It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian! The boldness of it!\nThe coolness!”\n\n“That’s just what it wasn’t!” interposed Razumihin. “That’s what throws\nyou all off the scent. But I maintain that he is not cunning, not\npractised, and probably this was his first crime! The supposition that\nit was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn’t work. Suppose\nhim to have been inexperienced, and it’s clear that it was only a chance\nthat saved him--and chance may do anything. Why, he did not foresee\nobstacles, perhaps! And how did he set to work? He took jewels worth\nten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets with them, ransacked the\nold woman’s trunks, her rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles,\nbesides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest! He did not know\nhow to rob; he could only murder. It was his first crime, I assure you,\nhis first crime; he lost his head. And he got off more by luck than good\ncounsel!”\n\n“You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I believe?” Pyotr\nPetrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov. He was standing, hat and gloves\nin hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more\nintellectual phrases. He was evidently anxious to make a favourable\nimpression and his vanity overcame his prudence.\n\n“Yes. You’ve heard of it?”\n\n“Oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood.”\n\n“Do you know the details?”\n\n“I can’t say that; but another circumstance interests me in the\ncase--the whole question, so to say. Not to speak of the fact that crime\nhas been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last\nfive years, not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere,\nwhat strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes,\ntoo, crime is increasing proportionately. In one place one hears of a\nstudent’s robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people of\ngood social position forge false banknotes; in Moscow of late a whole\ngang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets, and one of\nthe ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretary\nabroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain.... And if this old\nwoman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by someone of a higher class\nin society--for peasants don’t pawn gold trinkets--how are we to explain\nthis demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?”\n\n“There are many economic changes,” put in Zossimov.\n\n“How are we to explain it?” Razumihin caught him up. “It might be\nexplained by our inveterate impracticality.”\n\n“How do you mean?”\n\n“What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he\nwas forging notes? ‘Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so I\nwant to make haste to get rich too.’ I don’t remember the exact words,\nbut the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or\nworking! We’ve grown used to having everything ready-made, to walking\non crutches, to having our food chewed for us. Then the great hour\nstruck,[*] and every man showed himself in his true colours.”\n\n     [*] The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 is meant.\n     --TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.\n\n“But morality? And so to speak, principles...”\n\n“But why do you worry about it?” Raskolnikov interposed suddenly. “It’s\nin accordance with your theory!”\n\n“In accordance with my theory?”\n\n“Why, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and\nit follows that people may be killed...”\n\n“Upon my word!” cried Luzhin.\n\n“No, that’s not so,” put in Zossimov.\n\nRaskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathing\npainfully.\n\n“There’s a measure in all things,” Luzhin went on superciliously.\n“Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to\nsuppose...”\n\n“And is it true,” Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a\nvoice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, “is it true that\nyou told your _fiancée_... within an hour of her acceptance, that what\npleased you most... was that she was a beggar... because it was better\nto raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control over\nher, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?”\n\n“Upon my word,” Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, crimson with\nconfusion, “to distort my words in this way! Excuse me, allow me to\nassure you that the report which has reached you, or rather, let me say,\nhas been conveyed to you, has no foundation in truth, and I... suspect\nwho... in a word... this arrow... in a word, your mamma... She seemed\nto me in other things, with all her excellent qualities, of a somewhat\nhigh-flown and romantic way of thinking.... But I was a thousand miles\nfrom supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in\nso fanciful a way.... And indeed... indeed...”\n\n“I tell you what,” cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow and\nfixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, “I tell you what.”\n\n“What?” Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face.\nSilence lasted for some seconds.\n\n“Why, if ever again... you dare to mention a single word... about my\nmother... I shall send you flying downstairs!”\n\n“What’s the matter with you?” cried Razumihin.\n\n“So that’s how it is?” Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip. “Let me tell\nyou, sir,” he began deliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himself\nbut breathing hard, “at the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposed\nto me, but I remained here on purpose to find out more. I could forgive\na great deal in a sick man and a connection, but you... never after\nthis...”\n\n“I am not ill,” cried Raskolnikov.\n\n“So much the worse...”\n\n“Go to hell!”\n\nBut Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezing\nbetween the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him\npass. Without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, who\nhad for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone,\nhe went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid\ncrushing it as he stooped to go out of the door. And even the curve of\nhis spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received.\n\n“How could you--how could you!” Razumihin said, shaking his head in\nperplexity.\n\n“Let me alone--let me alone all of you!” Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy.\n“Will you ever leave off tormenting me? I am not afraid of you! I am\nnot afraid of anyone, anyone now! Get away from me! I want to be alone,\nalone, alone!”\n\n“Come along,” said Zossimov, nodding to Razumihin.\n\n“But we can’t leave him like this!”\n\n“Come along,” Zossimov repeated insistently, and he went out. Razumihin\nthought a minute and ran to overtake him.\n\n“It might be worse not to obey him,” said Zossimov on the stairs. “He\nmustn’t be irritated.”\n\n“What’s the matter with him?”\n\n“If only he could get some favourable shock, that’s what would do it! At\nfirst he was better.... You know he has got something on his mind! Some\nfixed idea weighing on him.... I am very much afraid so; he must have!”\n\n“Perhaps it’s that gentleman, Pyotr Petrovitch. From his conversation\nI gather he is going to marry his sister, and that he had received a\nletter about it just before his illness....”\n\n“Yes, confound the man! he may have upset the case altogether. But have\nyou noticed, he takes no interest in anything, he does not respond to\nanything except one point on which he seems excited--that’s the murder?”\n\n“Yes, yes,” Razumihin agreed, “I noticed that, too. He is interested,\nfrightened. It gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police\noffice; he fainted.”\n\n“Tell me more about that this evening and I’ll tell you something\nafterwards. He interests me very much! In half an hour I’ll go and see\nhim again.... There’ll be no inflammation though.”\n\n“Thanks! And I’ll wait with Pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him\nthrough Nastasya....”\n\nRaskolnikov, left alone, looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya,\nbut she still lingered.\n\n“Won’t you have some tea now?” she asked.\n\n“Later! I am sleepy! Leave me.”\n\nHe turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nBut as soon as she went out, he got up, latched the door, undid the\nparcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again\nand began dressing. Strange to say, he seemed immediately to have become\nperfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic\nfear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment of a strange\nsudden calm. His movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose was\nevident in them. “To-day, to-day,” he muttered to himself. He understood\nthat he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him\nstrength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he would not\nfall down in the street. When he had dressed in entirely new clothes, he\nlooked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment’s thought\nput it in his pocket. It was twenty-five roubles. He took also all the\ncopper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes.\nThen he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and\nglanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing with her back\nto him, blowing up the landlady’s samovar. She heard nothing. Who would\nhave dreamed of his going out, indeed? A minute later he was in the\nstreet.\n\nIt was nearly eight o’clock, the sun was setting. It was as stifling as\nbefore, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air. His head\nfelt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his\nfeverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face. He did not know and\ndid not think where he was going, he had one thought only: “that all\n_this_ must be ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would\nnot return home without it, because he _would not go on living like\nthat_.” How, with what to make an end? He had not an idea about it,\nhe did not even want to think of it. He drove away thought; thought\ntortured him. All he knew, all he felt was that everything must be\nchanged “one way or another,” he repeated with desperate and immovable\nself-confidence and determination.\n\nFrom old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay\nMarket. A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in\nthe road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very\nsentimental song. He was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood\non the pavement in front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline, a\nmantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all very\nold and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked and\ncoarsened by street singing, she sang in hope of getting a copper from\nthe shop. Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a five\ncopeck piece and put it in the girl’s hand. She broke off abruptly on a\nsentimental high note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder “Come on,”\n and both moved on to the next shop.\n\n“Do you like street music?” said Raskolnikov, addressing a middle-aged\nman standing idly by him. The man looked at him, startled and wondering.\n\n“I love to hear singing to a street organ,” said Raskolnikov, and his\nmanner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--“I like it\non cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the\npassers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet\nsnow is falling straight down, when there’s no wind--you know what I\nmean?--and the street lamps shine through it...”\n\n“I don’t know.... Excuse me...” muttered the stranger, frightened by the\nquestion and Raskolnikov’s strange manner, and he crossed over to the\nother side of the street.\n\nRaskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the Hay\nMarket, where the huckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta; but\nthey were not there now. Recognising the place, he stopped, looked round\nand addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a\ncorn chandler’s shop.\n\n“Isn’t there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner?”\n\n“All sorts of people keep booths here,” answered the young man, glancing\nsuperciliously at Raskolnikov.\n\n“What’s his name?”\n\n“What he was christened.”\n\n“Aren’t you a Zaraïsky man, too? Which province?”\n\nThe young man looked at Raskolnikov again.\n\n“It’s not a province, your excellency, but a district. Graciously\nforgive me, your excellency!”\n\n“Is that a tavern at the top there?”\n\n“Yes, it’s an eating-house and there’s a billiard-room and you’ll find\nprincesses there too.... La-la!”\n\nRaskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was a dense crowd\nof peasants. He pushed his way into the thickest part of it, looking\nat the faces. He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into\nconversation with people. But the peasants took no notice of him; they\nwere all shouting in groups together. He stood and thought a little and\ntook a turning to the right in the direction of V.\n\nHe had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading\nfrom the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of late he had often felt drawn\nto wander about this district, when he felt depressed, that he might\nfeel more so.\n\nNow he walked along, thinking of nothing. At that point there is a great\nblock of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses;\nwomen were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their\nindoor clothes. Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement,\nespecially about the entrances to various festive establishments in\nthe lower storeys. From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the\ntinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street.\nA crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the\nsteps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunken\nsoldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road,\nswearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but had\nforgotten where. One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man dead\ndrunk was lying right across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of\nwomen, who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed and wore\ncotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were women of forty and some\nnot more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes.\n\nHe felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and\nuproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancing\nfrantically, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar\nand of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air. He listened intently,\ngloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping\ninquisitively in from the pavement.\n\n  “Oh, my handsome soldier\n   Don’t beat me for nothing,”\n\ntrilled the thin voice of the singer. Raskolnikov felt a great desire to\nmake out what he was singing, as though everything depended on that.\n\n“Shall I go in?” he thought. “They are laughing. From drink. Shall I get\ndrunk?”\n\n“Won’t you come in?” one of the women asked him. Her voice was\nstill musical and less thick than the others, she was young and not\nrepulsive--the only one of the group.\n\n“Why, she’s pretty,” he said, drawing himself up and looking at her.\n\nShe smiled, much pleased at the compliment.\n\n“You’re very nice looking yourself,” she said.\n\n“Isn’t he thin though!” observed another woman in a deep bass. “Have you\njust come out of a hospital?”\n\n“They’re all generals’ daughters, it seems, but they have all snub\nnoses,” interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face, wearing\na loose coat. “See how jolly they are.”\n\n“Go along with you!”\n\n“I’ll go, sweetie!”\n\nAnd he darted down into the saloon below. Raskolnikov moved on.\n\n“I say, sir,” the girl shouted after him.\n\n“What is it?”\n\nShe hesitated.\n\n“I’ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, but\nnow I feel shy. Give me six copecks for a drink, there’s a nice young\nman!”\n\nRaskolnikov gave her what came first--fifteen copecks.\n\n“Ah, what a good-natured gentleman!”\n\n“What’s your name?”\n\n“Ask for Duclida.”\n\n“Well, that’s too much,” one of the women observed, shaking her head\nat Duclida. “I don’t know how you can ask like that. I believe I should\ndrop with shame....”\n\nRaskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker. She was a pock-marked wench\nof thirty, covered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen. She made\nher criticism quietly and earnestly. “Where is it,” thought Raskolnikov.\n“Where is it I’ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks,\nan hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock,\non such a narrow ledge that he’d only room to stand, and the ocean,\neverlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around\nhim, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his\nlife, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die\nat once! Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!...\nHow true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!... And vile\nis he who calls him vile for that,” he added a moment later.\n\nHe went into another street. “Bah, the Palais de Cristal! Razumihin\nwas just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But what on earth was it\nI wanted? Yes, the newspapers.... Zossimov said he’d read it in the\npapers. Have you the papers?” he asked, going into a very spacious and\npositively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were,\nhowever, rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea, and in a\nroom further away were sitting four men drinking champagne. Raskolnikov\nfancied that Zametov was one of them, but he could not be sure at that\ndistance. “What if it is?” he thought.\n\n“Will you have vodka?” asked the waiter.\n\n“Give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the last\nfive days, and I’ll give you something.”\n\n“Yes, sir, here’s to-day’s. No vodka?”\n\nThe old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskolnikov sat down and\nbegan to look through them.\n\n“Oh, damn... these are the items of intelligence. An accident on a\nstaircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire\nin Peski... a fire in the Petersburg quarter... another fire in the\nPetersburg quarter... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter....\nAh, here it is!” He found at last what he was seeking and began to\nread it. The lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began\neagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers. His hands\nshook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets. Suddenly someone\nsat down beside him at his table. He looked up, it was the head clerk\nZametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the\nwatch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the\nsmart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He was in a good\nhumour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly. His dark\nface was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk.\n\n“What, you here?” he began in surprise, speaking as though he’d known\nhim all his life. “Why, Razumihin told me only yesterday you were\nunconscious. How strange! And do you know I’ve been to see you?”\n\nRaskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid aside the papers and\nturned to Zametov. There was a smile on his lips, and a new shade of\nirritable impatience was apparent in that smile.\n\n“I know you have,” he answered. “I’ve heard it. You looked for my\nsock.... And you know Razumihin has lost his heart to you? He says\nyou’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna’s--you know, the woman you tried\nto befriend, for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he\nwould not understand. Do you remember? How could he fail to\nunderstand--it was quite clear, wasn’t it?”\n\n“What a hot head he is!”\n\n“The explosive one?”\n\n“No, your friend Razumihin.”\n\n“You must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to the most\nagreeable places. Who’s been pouring champagne into you just now?”\n\n“We’ve just been... having a drink together.... You talk about pouring\nit into me!”\n\n“By way of a fee! You profit by everything!” Raskolnikov laughed, “it’s\nall right, my dear boy,” he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder. “I\nam not speaking from temper, but in a friendly way, for sport, as that\nworkman of yours said when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of\nthe old woman....”\n\n“How do you know about it?”\n\n“Perhaps I know more about it than you do.”\n\n“How strange you are.... I am sure you are still very unwell. You\noughtn’t to have come out.”\n\n“Oh, do I seem strange to you?”\n\n“Yes. What are you doing, reading the papers?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“There’s a lot about the fires.”\n\n“No, I am not reading about the fires.” Here he looked mysteriously at\nZametov; his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile. “No, I am not\nreading about the fires,” he went on, winking at Zametov. “But confess\nnow, my dear fellow, you’re awfully anxious to know what I am reading\nabout?”\n\n“I am not in the least. Mayn’t I ask a question? Why do you keep\non...?”\n\n“Listen, you are a man of culture and education?”\n\n“I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,” said Zametov with some\ndignity.\n\n“Sixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow! With your parting and your rings--you\nare a gentleman of fortune. Foo! what a charming boy!” Here Raskolnikov\nbroke into a nervous laugh right in Zametov’s face. The latter drew\nback, more amazed than offended.\n\n“Foo! how strange you are!” Zametov repeated very seriously. “I can’t\nhelp thinking you are still delirious.”\n\n“I am delirious? You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow! So I am strange? You\nfind me curious, do you?”\n\n“Yes, curious.”\n\n“Shall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was looking for? See\nwhat a lot of papers I’ve made them bring me. Suspicious, eh?”\n\n“Well, what is it?”\n\n“You prick up your ears?”\n\n“How do you mean--‘prick up my ears’?”\n\n“I’ll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, I declare to you... no,\nbetter ‘I confess’... No, that’s not right either; ‘I make a deposition\nand you take it.’ I depose that I was reading, that I was looking and\nsearching....” he screwed up his eyes and paused. “I was searching--and\ncame here on purpose to do it--for news of the murder of the old\npawnbroker woman,” he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing\nhis face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov. Zametov looked at him\nsteadily, without moving or drawing his face away. What struck Zametov\nafterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for\nexactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while.\n\n“What if you have been reading about it?” he cried at last, perplexed\nand impatient. “That’s no business of mine! What of it?”\n\n“The same old woman,” Raskolnikov went on in the same whisper, not\nheeding Zametov’s explanation, “about whom you were talking in the\npolice-office, you remember, when I fainted. Well, do you understand\nnow?”\n\n“What do you mean? Understand... what?” Zametov brought out, almost\nalarmed.\n\nRaskolnikov’s set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and he\nsuddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as though\nutterly unable to restrain himself. And in one flash he recalled with\nextraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, that\nmoment when he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch\ntrembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a sudden\ndesire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his tongue at\nthem, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!\n\n“You are either mad, or...” began Zametov, and he broke off, as though\nstunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind.\n\n“Or? Or what? What? Come, tell me!”\n\n“Nothing,” said Zametov, getting angry, “it’s all nonsense!”\n\nBoth were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became\nsuddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He put his elbow on the table and\nleaned his head on his hand. He seemed to have completely forgotten\nZametov. The silence lasted for some time.\n\n“Why don’t you drink your tea? It’s getting cold,” said Zametov.\n\n“What! Tea? Oh, yes....” Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of\nbread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember\neverything and pulled himself together. At the same moment his face\nresumed its original mocking expression. He went on drinking tea.\n\n“There have been a great many of these crimes lately,” said Zametov.\n“Only the other day I read in the _Moscow News_ that a whole gang of\nfalse coiners had been caught in Moscow. It was a regular society. They\nused to forge tickets!”\n\n“Oh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month ago,”\n Raskolnikov answered calmly. “So you consider them criminals?” he added,\nsmiling.\n\n“Of course they are criminals.”\n\n“They? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, half a hundred\npeople meeting for such an object--what an idea! Three would be too\nmany, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in\nthemselves! One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.\nSimpletons! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--what\na thing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that these\nsimpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the\nrest of their lives? Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his\nlife! Better hang oneself at once! And they did not know how to change\nthe notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand\nroubles, and his hands trembled. He counted the first four thousand,\nbut did not count the fifth thousand--he was in such a hurry to get the\nmoney into his pocket and run away. Of course he roused suspicion. And\nthe whole thing came to a crash through one fool! Is it possible?”\n\n“That his hands trembled?” observed Zametov, “yes, that’s quite\npossible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible. Sometimes one can’t\nstand things.”\n\n“Can’t stand that?”\n\n“Why, could you stand it then? No, I couldn’t. For the sake of a hundred\nroubles to face such a terrible experience? To go with false notes\ninto a bank where it’s their business to spot that sort of thing! No, I\nshould not have the face to do it. Would you?”\n\nRaskolnikov had an intense desire again “to put his tongue out.” Shivers\nkept running down his spine.\n\n“I should do it quite differently,” Raskolnikov began. “This is how I\nwould change the notes: I’d count the first thousand three or four times\nbackwards and forwards, looking at every note and then I’d set to the\nsecond thousand; I’d count that half-way through and then hold some\nfifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light\nagain--to see whether it was a good one. ‘I am afraid,’ I would say, ‘a\nrelation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a\nfalse note,’ and then I’d tell them the whole story. And after I began\ncounting the third, ‘No, excuse me,’ I would say, ‘I fancy I made a\nmistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.’\nAnd so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and\nso on to the end. And when I had finished, I’d pick out one from the\nfifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light\nand ask again, ‘Change them, please,’ and put the clerk into such a stew\nthat he would not know how to get rid of me. When I’d finished and had\ngone out, I’d come back, ‘No, excuse me,’ and ask for some explanation.\nThat’s how I’d do it.”\n\n“Foo! what terrible things you say!” said Zametov, laughing. “But all\nthat is only talk. I dare say when it came to deeds you’d make a slip.\nI believe that even a practised, desperate man cannot always reckon on\nhimself, much less you and I. To take an example near home--that old\nwoman murdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been a\ndesperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, was saved by\na miracle--but his hands shook, too. He did not succeed in robbing the\nplace, he couldn’t stand it. That was clear from the...”\n\nRaskolnikov seemed offended.\n\n“Clear? Why don’t you catch him then?” he cried, maliciously gibing at\nZametov.\n\n“Well, they will catch him.”\n\n“Who? You? Do you suppose you could catch him? You’ve a tough job! A\ngreat point for you is whether a man is spending money or not. If he had\nno money and suddenly begins spending, he must be the man. So that any\nchild can mislead you.”\n\n“The fact is they always do that, though,” answered Zametov. “A man will\ncommit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes\ndrinking in a tavern. They are caught spending money, they are not all\nas cunning as you are. You wouldn’t go to a tavern, of course?”\n\nRaskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov.\n\n“You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I should\nbehave in that case, too?” he asked with displeasure.\n\n“I should like to,” Zametov answered firmly and seriously. Somewhat too\nmuch earnestness began to appear in his words and looks.\n\n“Very much?”\n\n“Very much!”\n\n“All right then. This is how I should behave,” Raskolnikov began, again\nbringing his face close to Zametov’s, again staring at him and speaking\nin a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered. “This is what\nI should have done. I should have taken the money and jewels, I should\nhave walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place\nwith fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden\nor place of that sort. I should have looked out beforehand some stone\nweighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from\nthe time the house was built. I would lift that stone--there would sure\nto be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in that\nhole. Then I’d roll the stone back so that it would look as before,\nwould press it down with my foot and walk away. And for a year or two,\nthree maybe, I would not touch it. And, well, they could search! There’d\nbe no trace.”\n\n“You are a madman,” said Zametov, and for some reason he too spoke in a\nwhisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering. He\nhad turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering.\nHe bent down as close as possible to Zametov, and his lips began to move\nwithout uttering a word. This lasted for half a minute; he knew what he\nwas doing, but could not restrain himself. The terrible word trembled on\nhis lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break\nout, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out.\n\n“And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?” he said\nsuddenly and--realised what he had done.\n\nZametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth. His\nface wore a contorted smile.\n\n“But is it possible?” he brought out faintly. Raskolnikov looked\nwrathfully at him.\n\n“Own up that you believed it, yes, you did?”\n\n“Not a bit of it, I believe it less than ever now,” Zametov cried\nhastily.\n\n“I’ve caught my cock-sparrow! So you did believe it before, if now you\nbelieve less than ever?”\n\n“Not at all,” cried Zametov, obviously embarrassed. “Have you been\nfrightening me so as to lead up to this?”\n\n“You don’t believe it then? What were you talking about behind my\nback when I went out of the police-office? And why did the explosive\nlieutenant question me after I fainted? Hey, there,” he shouted to the\nwaiter, getting up and taking his cap, “how much?”\n\n“Thirty copecks,” the latter replied, running up.\n\n“And there is twenty copecks for vodka. See what a lot of money!” he\nheld out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. “Red notes and\nblue, twenty-five roubles. Where did I get them? And where did my new\nclothes come from? You know I had not a copeck. You’ve cross-examined my\nlandlady, I’ll be bound.... Well, that’s enough! _Assez causé!_ Till we\nmeet again!”\n\nHe went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical\nsensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture. Yet he\nwas gloomy and terribly tired. His face was twisted as after a fit.\nHis fatigue increased rapidly. Any shock, any irritating sensation\nstimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed as\nquickly when the stimulus was removed.\n\nZametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged in\nthought. Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on\na certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively.\n\n“Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead,” he decided.\n\nRaskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he\nstumbled against Razumihin on the steps. They did not see each other\ntill they almost knocked against each other. For a moment they stood\nlooking each other up and down. Razumihin was greatly astounded, then\nanger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.\n\n“So here you are!” he shouted at the top of his voice--“you ran away\nfrom your bed! And here I’ve been looking for you under the sofa! We\nwent up to the garret. I almost beat Nastasya on your account. And here\nhe is after all. Rodya! What is the meaning of it? Tell me the whole\ntruth! Confess! Do you hear?”\n\n“It means that I’m sick to death of you all and I want to be alone,”\n Raskolnikov answered calmly.\n\n“Alone? When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a\nsheet and you are gasping for breath! Idiot!... What have you been doing\nin the Palais de Cristal? Own up at once!”\n\n“Let me go!” said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him. This was too much\nfor Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder.\n\n“Let you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do you know what I’ll do\nwith you directly? I’ll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you\nhome under my arm and lock you up!”\n\n“Listen, Razumihin,” Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm--“can’t\nyou see that I don’t want your benevolence? A strange desire you have to\nshower benefits on a man who... curses them, who feels them a burden in\nfact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness? Maybe I\nwas very glad to die. Didn’t I tell you plainly enough to-day that\nyou were torturing me, that I was... sick of you! You seem to want to\ntorture people! I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my\nrecovery, because it’s continually irritating me. You saw Zossimov\nwent away just now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too, for\ngoodness’ sake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me by force? Don’t\nyou see that I am in possession of all my faculties now? How, how can\nI persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness? I may be\nungrateful, I may be mean, only let me be, for God’s sake, let me be!\nLet me be, let me be!”\n\nHe began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was\nabout to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he had\nbeen with Luzhin.\n\nRazumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop.\n\n“Well, go to hell then,” he said gently and thoughtfully. “Stay,” he\nroared, as Raskolnikov was about to move. “Listen to me. Let me tell\nyou, that you are all a set of babbling, posing idiots! If you’ve any\nlittle trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg. And you are\nplagiarists even in that! There isn’t a sign of independent life in\nyou! You are made of spermaceti ointment and you’ve lymph in your veins\ninstead of blood. I don’t believe in anyone of you! In any circumstances\nthe first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being! Stop!” he\ncried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again making\na movement--“hear me out! You know I’m having a house-warming this\nevening, I dare say they’ve arrived by now, but I left my uncle there--I\njust ran in--to receive the guests. And if you weren’t a fool, a common\nfool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation...\nyou see, Rodya, I recognise you’re a clever fellow, but you’re a\nfool!--and if you weren’t a fool you’d come round to me this evening\ninstead of wearing out your boots in the street! Since you have gone\nout, there’s no help for it! I’d give you a snug easy chair, my landlady\nhas one... a cup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the sofa--any\nway you would be with us.... Zossimov will be there too. Will you come?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“R-rubbish!” Razumihin shouted, out of patience. “How do you know?\nYou can’t answer for yourself! You don’t know anything about it....\nThousands of times I’ve fought tooth and nail with people and run back\nto them afterwards.... One feels ashamed and goes back to a man! So\nremember, Potchinkov’s house on the third storey....”\n\n“Why, Mr. Razumihin, I do believe you’d let anybody beat you from sheer\nbenevolence.”\n\n“Beat? Whom? Me? I’d twist his nose off at the mere idea! Potchinkov’s\nhouse, 47, Babushkin’s flat....”\n\n“I shall not come, Razumihin.” Raskolnikov turned and walked away.\n\n“I bet you will,” Razumihin shouted after him. “I refuse to know you if\nyou don’t! Stay, hey, is Zametov in there?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Did you see him?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Talked to him?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What about? Confound you, don’t tell me then. Potchinkov’s house, 47,\nBabushkin’s flat, remember!”\n\nRaskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sadovy Street.\nRazumihin looked after him thoughtfully. Then with a wave of his hand he\nwent into the house but stopped short of the stairs.\n\n“Confound it,” he went on almost aloud. “He talked sensibly but yet...\nI am a fool! As if madmen didn’t talk sensibly! And this was just what\nZossimov seemed afraid of.” He struck his finger on his forehead. “What\nif... how could I let him go off alone? He may drown himself.... Ach,\nwhat a blunder! I can’t.” And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, but\nthere was no trace of him. With a curse he returned with rapid steps to\nthe Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.\n\nRaskolnikov walked straight to X---- Bridge, stood in the middle, and\nleaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance. On parting\nwith Razumihin, he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this\nplace. He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending\nover the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the\nsunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at\none distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in\nthe last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal,\nand the water seemed to catch his attention. At last red circles flashed\nbefore his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal\nbanks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he started,\nsaved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight. He\nbecame aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he looked\nand saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow,\nwasted face and red sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him, but\nobviously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she leaned her\nright hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, then\nher left and threw herself into the canal. The filthy water parted and\nswallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning\nwoman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head\nand legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back.\n\n“A woman drowning! A woman drowning!” shouted dozens of voices; people\nran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge people\ncrowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him.\n\n“Mercy on it! it’s our Afrosinya!” a woman cried tearfully close by.\n“Mercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!”\n\n“A boat, a boat” was shouted in the crowd. But there was no need of a\nboat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his great\ncoat and his boots and rushed into the water. It was easy to reach her:\nshe floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of\nher clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a\ncomrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once. They\nlaid her on the granite pavement of the embankment. She soon recovered\nconsciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing,\nstupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.\n\n“She’s drunk herself out of her senses,” the same woman’s voice wailed\nat her side. “Out of her senses. The other day she tried to hang\nherself, we cut her down. I ran out to the shop just now, left my little\ngirl to look after her--and here she’s in trouble again! A neighbour,\ngentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end,\nsee yonder....”\n\nThe crowd broke up. The police still remained round the woman, someone\nmentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange\nsensation of indifference and apathy. He felt disgusted. “No, that’s\nloathsome... water... it’s not good enough,” he muttered to himself.\n“Nothing will come of it,” he added, “no use to wait. What about the\npolice office...? And why isn’t Zametov at the police office? The police\noffice is open till ten o’clock....” He turned his back to the railing\nand looked about him.\n\n“Very well then!” he said resolutely; he moved from the bridge and\nwalked in the direction of the police office. His heart felt hollow and\nempty. He did not want to think. Even his depression had passed, there\nwas not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out “to make an\nend of it all.” Complete apathy had succeeded to it.\n\n“Well, it’s a way out of it,” he thought, walking slowly and listlessly\nalong the canal bank. “Anyway I’ll make an end, for I want to.... But\nis it a way out? What does it matter! There’ll be the square yard of\nspace--ha! But what an end! Is it really the end? Shall I tell them or\nnot? Ah... damn! How tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie\ndown soon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But I don’t\ncare about that either! What idiotic ideas come into one’s head.”\n\nTo reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the\nsecond turning to the left. It was only a few paces away. But at the\nfirst turning he stopped and, after a minute’s thought, turned into a\nside street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without any\nobject, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, looking\nat the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted\nhis head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.\nHe had not passed it, he had not been near it since _that_ evening.\nAn overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on. He went into the\nhouse, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the\nright, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.\nThe narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He stopped at each landing\nand looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework\nof the window had been taken out. “That wasn’t so then,” he thought.\nHere was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been\nworking. “It’s shut up and the door newly painted. So it’s to let.” Then\nthe third storey and the fourth. “Here!” He was perplexed to find the\ndoor of the flat wide open. There were men there, he could hear voices;\nhe had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last\nstairs and went into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were\nworkmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he\nwould find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the\nsame places on the floor. And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed\nstrange. He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill. There\nwere two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the\nother. They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with\nlilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for\nsome reason felt horribly annoyed by this. He looked at the new paper\nwith dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.\nThe workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were\nhurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home. They took\nno notice of Raskolnikov’s coming in; they were talking. Raskolnikov\nfolded his arms and listened.\n\n“She comes to me in the morning,” said the elder to the younger, “very\nearly, all dressed up. ‘Why are you preening and prinking?’ says I. ‘I\nam ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!’ That’s a way of\ngoing on! And she dressed up like a regular fashion book!”\n\n“And what is a fashion book?” the younger one asked. He obviously\nregarded the other as an authority.\n\n“A fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they come to the\ntailors here every Saturday, by post from abroad, to show folks how\nto dress, the male sex as well as the female. They’re pictures. The\ngentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies’ fluffles,\nthey’re beyond anything you can fancy.”\n\n“There’s nothing you can’t find in Petersburg,” the younger cried\nenthusiastically, “except father and mother, there’s everything!”\n\n“Except them, there’s everything to be found, my boy,” the elder\ndeclared sententiously.\n\nRaskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box,\nthe bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him very\ntiny without furniture in it. The paper was the same; the paper in the\ncorner showed where the case of ikons had stood. He looked at it and\nwent to the window. The elder workman looked at him askance.\n\n“What do you want?” he asked suddenly.\n\nInstead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the\nbell. The same bell, the same cracked note. He rang it a second and\na third time; he listened and remembered. The hideous and agonisingly\nfearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more\nvividly. He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more\nsatisfaction.\n\n“Well, what do you want? Who are you?” the workman shouted, going out to\nhim. Raskolnikov went inside again.\n\n“I want to take a flat,” he said. “I am looking round.”\n\n“It’s not the time to look at rooms at night! and you ought to come up\nwith the porter.”\n\n“The floors have been washed, will they be painted?” Raskolnikov went\non. “Is there no blood?”\n\n“What blood?”\n\n“Why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here. There was a\nperfect pool there.”\n\n“But who are you?” the workman cried, uneasy.\n\n“Who am I?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You want to know? Come to the police station, I’ll tell you.”\n\nThe workmen looked at him in amazement.\n\n“It’s time for us to go, we are late. Come along, Alyoshka. We must lock\nup,” said the elder workman.\n\n“Very well, come along,” said Raskolnikov indifferently, and going\nout first, he went slowly downstairs. “Hey, porter,” he cried in the\ngateway.\n\nAt the entrance several people were standing, staring at the passers-by;\nthe two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others.\nRaskolnikov went straight up to them.\n\n“What do you want?” asked one of the porters.\n\n“Have you been to the police office?”\n\n“I’ve just been there. What do you want?”\n\n“Is it open?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\n“Is the assistant there?”\n\n“He was there for a time. What do you want?”\n\nRaskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought.\n\n“He’s been to look at the flat,” said the elder workman, coming forward.\n\n“Which flat?”\n\n“Where we are at work. ‘Why have you washed away the blood?’ says he.\n‘There has been a murder here,’ says he, ‘and I’ve come to take it.’\nAnd he began ringing at the bell, all but broke it. ‘Come to the police\nstation,’ says he. ‘I’ll tell you everything there.’ He wouldn’t leave\nus.”\n\nThe porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed.\n\n“Who are you?” he shouted as impressively as he could.\n\n“I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, I live in\nShil’s house, not far from here, flat Number 14, ask the porter, he\nknows me.” Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, not\nturning round, but looking intently into the darkening street.\n\n“Why have you been to the flat?”\n\n“To look at it.”\n\n“What is there to look at?”\n\n“Take him straight to the police station,” the man in the long coat\njerked in abruptly.\n\nRaskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the\nsame slow, lazy tones:\n\n“Come along.”\n\n“Yes, take him,” the man went on more confidently. “Why was he going\ninto _that_, what’s in his mind, eh?”\n\n“He’s not drunk, but God knows what’s the matter with him,” muttered the\nworkman.\n\n“But what do you want?” the porter shouted again, beginning to get angry\nin earnest--“Why are you hanging about?”\n\n“You funk the police station then?” said Raskolnikov jeeringly.\n\n“How funk it? Why are you hanging about?”\n\n“He’s a rogue!” shouted the peasant woman.\n\n“Why waste time talking to him?” cried the other porter, a huge peasant\nin a full open coat and with keys on his belt. “Get along! He is a rogue\nand no mistake. Get along!”\n\nAnd seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street. He\nlurched forward, but recovered his footing, looked at the spectators in\nsilence and walked away.\n\n“Strange man!” observed the workman.\n\n“There are strange folks about nowadays,” said the woman.\n\n“You should have taken him to the police station all the same,” said the\nman in the long coat.\n\n“Better have nothing to do with him,” decided the big porter. “A regular\nrogue! Just what he wants, you may be sure, but once take him up, you\nwon’t get rid of him.... We know the sort!”\n\n“Shall I go there or not?” thought Raskolnikov, standing in the middle\nof the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he looked about him, as\nthough expecting from someone a decisive word. But no sound came, all\nwas dead and silent like the stones on which he walked, dead to him, to\nhim alone.... All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards\naway, in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.\nIn the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... A light gleamed in the\nmiddle of the street. “What is it?” Raskolnikov turned to the right\nand went up to the crowd. He seemed to clutch at everything and smiled\ncoldly when he recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to\nthe police station and knew that it would all soon be over.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nAn elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of\nspirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got\noff his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle....\nA mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front. One\nof them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying\nclose to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the\ncoachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:\n\n“What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!”\n\nRaskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last\nin seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a\nman who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with\nblood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was\nflowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and\ndisfigured. He was evidently badly injured.\n\n“Merciful heaven!” wailed the coachman, “what more could I do? If I’d\nbeen driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly,\nnot in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody\nelse. A drunken man can’t walk straight, we all know.... I saw him\ncrossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again\nand a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell\nstraight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very\ntipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started,\nhe screamed... that made them worse. That’s how it happened!”\n\n“That’s just how it was,” a voice in the crowd confirmed.\n\n“He shouted, that’s true, he shouted three times,” another voice\ndeclared.\n\n“Three times it was, we all heard it,” shouted a third.\n\nBut the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was\nevident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who\nwas awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little\nanxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to\ntake the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew\nhis name.\n\nMeanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The\nlantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man’s face. He recognised\nhim.\n\n“I know him! I know him!” he shouted, pushing to the front. “It’s a\ngovernment clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives close\nby in Kozel’s house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?” He\npulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in\nviolent agitation.\n\nThe police were glad that they had found out who the man was.\nRaskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it\nhad been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious\nMarmeladov to his lodging at once.\n\n“Just here, three houses away,” he said eagerly, “the house belongs to\nKozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him,\nhe is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one\ndaughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is\nsure to be a doctor in the house. I’ll pay, I’ll pay! At least he will\nbe looked after at home... they will help him at once. But he’ll die\nbefore you get him to the hospital.” He managed to slip something\nunseen into the policeman’s hand. But the thing was straightforward\nand legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised the\ninjured man; people volunteered to help.\n\nKozel’s house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind,\ncarefully holding Marmeladov’s head and showing the way.\n\n“This way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn\nround! I’ll pay, I’ll make it worth your while,” he muttered.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free\nmoment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and\nback again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself\nand coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest\ngirl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not\nunderstand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so\nalways watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost\nto appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her little\nbrother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was\nwaiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night.\nHe was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent,\nserious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him--heels\ntogether and toes turned out.\n\nHe was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting\nperfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good\nlittle boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A little\ngirl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen,\nwaiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieve\nthem a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the\nother rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor,\nconsumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner\nduring that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than\never.\n\n“You wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, Polenka,” she said, walking\nabout the room, “what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa’s house\nand how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!\nPapa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that\neveryone who came to see him said, ‘We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch,\nas our governor!’ When I... when...” she coughed violently, “oh, cursed\nlife,” she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her\nbreast, “when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal’s...\nPrincess Bezzemelny saw me--who gave me the blessing when your father\nand I were married, Polenka--she asked at once ‘Isn’t that the pretty\ngirl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?’ (You must mend\nthat tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or\nto-morrow--cough, cough, cough--he will make the hole bigger,” she\narticulated with effort.) “Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just\ncome from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to\nmake me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions\nand told him that my heart had long been another’s. That other was your\nfather, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me\nthe shirt, and the stockings! Lida,” said she to the youngest one, “you\nmust manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out\nwith it... I’ll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond\ndoesn’t come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout,\nhe has torn it to rags! I’d do it all together, so as not to have to\nwork two nights running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again!\nWhat’s this?” she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men,\nwho were pushing into her room, carrying a burden. “What is it? What are\nthey bringing? Mercy on us!”\n\n“Where are we to put him?” asked the policeman, looking round when\nMarmeladov, unconscious and covered with blood, had been carried in.\n\n“On the sofa! Put him straight on the sofa, with his head this way,”\n Raskolnikov showed him.\n\n“Run over in the road! Drunk!” someone shouted in the passage.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath. The\nchildren were terrified. Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka and\nclutched at her, trembling all over.\n\nHaving laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna.\n\n“For God’s sake be calm, don’t be frightened!” he said, speaking\nquickly, “he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, don’t\nbe frightened, he will come to, I told them bring him here... I’ve been\nhere already, you remember? He will come to; I’ll pay!”\n\n“He’s done it this time!” Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she\nrushed to her husband.\n\nRaskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who\nswoon easily. She instantly placed under the luckless man’s head a\npillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining\nhim. She kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips\nand stifling the screams which were ready to break from her.\n\nRaskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor. There was a\ndoctor, it appeared, next door but one.\n\n“I’ve sent for a doctor,” he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, “don’t be\nuneasy, I’ll pay. Haven’t you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel,\nanything, as quick as you can.... He is injured, but not killed, believe\nme.... We shall see what the doctor says!”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in the\ncorner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, in\nreadiness for washing her children’s and husband’s linen that night.\nThis washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a\nweek, if not oftener. For the family had come to such a pass that they\nwere practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna could\nnot endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she\npreferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength when\nthe rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry\nby the morning. She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov’s request,\nbut almost fell down with her burden. But the latter had already\nsucceeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood off\nMarmeladov’s face.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her hands\nto her breast. She was in need of attention herself. Raskolnikov began\nto realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man\nbrought here. The policeman, too, stood in hesitation.\n\n“Polenka,” cried Katerina Ivanovna, “run to Sonia, make haste. If you\ndon’t find her at home, leave word that her father has been run over\nand that she is to come here at once... when she comes in. Run, Polenka!\nthere, put on the shawl.”\n\n“Run your fastest!” cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, after\nwhich he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his\nheels thrust forward and his toes spread out.\n\nMeanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn’t have\ndropped a pin. The policemen left, all except one, who remained for a\ntime, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs. Almost\nall Madame Lippevechsel’s lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms\nof the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, but\nafterwards they overflowed into the room. Katerina Ivanovna flew into a\nfury.\n\n“You might let him die in peace, at least,” she shouted at the crowd,\n“is it a spectacle for you to gape at? With cigarettes! (Cough, cough,\ncough!) You might as well keep your hats on.... And there is one in his\nhat!... Get away! You should respect the dead, at least!”\n\nHer cough choked her--but her reproaches were not without result. They\nevidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna. The lodgers, one after\nanother, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling\nof satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden\naccident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which\nno living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and\ncompassion.\n\nVoices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and saying\nthat they’d no business to make a disturbance here.\n\n“No business to die!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she was rushing to\nthe door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to\nface with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident\nand ran in to restore order. She was a particularly quarrelsome and\nirresponsible German.\n\n“Ah, my God!” she cried, clasping her hands, “your husband drunken\nhorses have trampled! To the hospital with him! I am the landlady!”\n\n“Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are saying,”\n Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with\nthe landlady that she might “remember her place” and even now could not\ndeny herself this satisfaction). “Amalia Ludwigovna...”\n\n“I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna may\nnot dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna.”\n\n“You are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, and as I am not\none of your despicable flatterers like Mr. Lebeziatnikov, who’s laughing\nbehind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of ‘they are at it\nagain’ was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call you\nAmalia Ludwigovna, though I fail to understand why you dislike that\nname. You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch;\nhe is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.\nLet him at least die in peace! Or I warn you the Governor-General,\nhimself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow. The prince knew\nme as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been\na benefactor to him. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many\nfriends and protectors, whom he abandoned himself from an honourable\npride, knowing his unhappy weakness, but now (she pointed to\nRaskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance, who has\nwealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from a\nchild. You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna...”\n\nAll this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker,\nbut a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna’s eloquence. At that\ninstant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she\nran to him. The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or\nunderstanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him. He drew\ndeep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth\nand drops of perspiration came out on his forehead. Not recognising\nRaskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna looked\nat him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes.\n\n“My God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is bleeding,” she said\nin despair. “We must take off his clothes. Turn a little, Semyon\nZaharovitch, if you can,” she cried to him.\n\nMarmeladov recognised her.\n\n“A priest,” he articulated huskily.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window\nframe and exclaimed in despair:\n\n“Oh, cursed life!”\n\n“A priest,” the dying man said again after a moment’s silence.\n\n“They’ve gone for him,” Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her\nshout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she\nreturned and stood by his pillow. He seemed a little easier but not for\nlong.\n\nSoon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in\nthe corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her\nwondering childish eyes.\n\n“A-ah,” he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say something.\n\n“What now?” cried Katerina Ivanovna.\n\n“Barefoot, barefoot!” he muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes the\nchild’s bare feet.\n\n“Be silent,” Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, “you know why she is\nbarefooted.”\n\n“Thank God, the doctor,” exclaimed Raskolnikov, relieved.\n\nThe doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking about\nhim mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully\nfelt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the\nblood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man’s chest. It was gashed,\ncrushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.\nOn the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking\nyellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horse’s hoof. The doctor\nfrowned. The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and\nturned round with it for thirty yards on the road.\n\n“It’s wonderful that he has recovered consciousness,” the doctor\nwhispered softly to Raskolnikov.\n\n“What do you think of him?” he asked.\n\n“He will die immediately.”\n\n“Is there really no hope?”\n\n“Not the faintest! He is at the last gasp.... His head is badly injured,\ntoo... Hm... I could bleed him if you like, but... it would be useless.\nHe is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes.”\n\n“Better bleed him then.”\n\n“If you like.... But I warn you it will be perfectly useless.”\n\nAt that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted,\nand the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing\nthe sacrament. A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.\nThe doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him.\nRaskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He shrugged his\nshoulders and remained.\n\nAll stepped back. The confession was soon over. The dying man probably\nunderstood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.\nKaterina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt\ndown in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of\nher. The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his\nlittle bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself with\nprecision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, which\nseemed to afford him especial satisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her\nlips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling\nstraight the boy’s shirt, and managed to cover the girl’s bare shoulders\nwith a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her\nknees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was\nopened inquisitively again. In the passage the crowd of spectators from\nall the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not\nventure beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the scene.\n\nAt that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. She\ncame in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for\nher mother, went up to her and said, “She’s coming, I met her in the\nstreet.” Her mother made her kneel beside her.\n\nTimidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd,\nand strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags,\ndeath and despair. She, too, was in rags, her attire was all of\nthe cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp,\nunmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the\ndoorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.\nShe forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with\nits ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the\nwhole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought\nwith her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat\nwith its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rakishly-tilted hat\nwas a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in\nterror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather\npretty, with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the\npriest; she too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some\nwords in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down and took a\nstep forward into the room, still keeping close to the door.\n\nThe service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.\nThe priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and\nconsolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.\n\n“What am I to do with these?” she interrupted sharply and irritably,\npointing to the little ones.\n\n“God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour,” the priest began.\n\n“Ach! He is merciful, but not to us.”\n\n“That’s a sin, a sin, madam,” observed the priest, shaking his head.\n\n“And isn’t that a sin?” cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dying\nman.\n\n“Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to\ncompensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings.”\n\n“You don’t understand!” cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand.\n“And why should they compensate me? Why, he was drunk and threw himself\nunder the horses! What earnings? He brought us in nothing but misery.\nHe drank everything away, the drunkard! He robbed us to get drink, he\nwasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank God he’s dying! One\nless to keep!”\n\n“You must forgive in the hour of death, that’s a sin, madam, such\nfeelings are a great sin.”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water,\nwiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight,\nand had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest. Now\nshe flew at him almost in a frenzy.\n\n“Ah, father! That’s words and only words! Forgive! If he’d not been run\nover, he’d have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and\nin rags and he’d have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been\nsousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the children’s\nand then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I\nshould have been darning them. That’s how I spend my nights!... What’s\nthe use of talking of forgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!”\n\nA terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put her handkerchief\nto her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her\naching chest. The handkerchief was covered with blood. The priest bowed\nhis head and said nothing.\n\nMarmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face\nof Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again. He kept trying\nto say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and\narticulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he\nwanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:\n\n“Be silent! No need! I know what you want to say!” And the sick man\nwas silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the\ndoorway and he saw Sonia.\n\nTill then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a\ncorner.\n\n“Who’s that? Who’s that?” he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice,\nin agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his\ndaughter was standing, and trying to sit up.\n\n“Lie down! Lie do-own!” cried Katerina Ivanovna.\n\nWith unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his\nelbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as\nthough not recognising her. He had never seen her before in such attire.\nSuddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and\ngaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying\nfather. His face showed intense suffering.\n\n“Sonia! Daughter! Forgive!” he cried, and he tried to hold out his hand\nto her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on\nthe floor. They rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but he\nwas dying. Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so\nwithout moving. He died in her arms.\n\n“He’s got what he wanted,” Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her husband’s\ndead body. “Well, what’s to be done now? How am I to bury him! What can\nI give them to-morrow to eat?”\n\nRaskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.\n\n“Katerina Ivanovna,” he began, “last week your husband told me all his\nlife and circumstances.... Believe me, he spoke of you with passionate\nreverence. From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to you\nall and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,\nin spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became\nfriends.... Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my\ndead friend. Here are twenty roubles, I think--and if that can be of any\nassistance to you, then... I... in short, I will come again, I will\nbe sure to come again... I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow....\nGood-bye!”\n\nAnd he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowd\nto the stairs. But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim\nFomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions\nin person. They had not met since the scene at the police station, but\nNikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.\n\n“Ah, is that you?” he asked him.\n\n“He’s dead,” answered Raskolnikov. “The doctor and the priest have been,\nall as it should have been. Don’t worry the poor woman too much, she is\nin consumption as it is. Try and cheer her up, if possible... you are a\nkind-hearted man, I know...” he added with a smile, looking straight in\nhis face.\n\n“But you are spattered with blood,” observed Nikodim Fomitch, noticing\nin the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikov’s waistcoat.\n\n“Yes... I’m covered with blood,” Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air;\nthen he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.\n\nHe walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious\nof it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and\nstrength that surged up suddenly within him. This sensation might be\ncompared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been\npardoned. Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on\nhis way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting\nwith him. He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid\nfootsteps behind him. Someone overtook him; it was Polenka. She was\nrunning after him, calling “Wait! wait!”\n\nHe turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped\nshort a step above him. A dim light came in from the yard. Raskolnikov\ncould distinguish the child’s thin but pretty little face, looking at\nhim with a bright childish smile. She had run after him with a message\nwhich she was evidently glad to give.\n\n“Tell me, what is your name?... and where do you live?” she said\nhurriedly in a breathless voice.\n\nHe laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of\nrapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have said\nwhy.\n\n“Who sent you?”\n\n“Sister Sonia sent me,” answered the girl, smiling still more brightly.\n\n“I knew it was sister Sonia sent you.”\n\n“Mamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up,\ntoo, and said ‘Run fast, Polenka.’”\n\n“Do you love sister Sonia?”\n\n“I love her more than anyone,” Polenka answered with a peculiar\nearnestness, and her smile became graver.\n\n“And will you love me?”\n\nBy way of answer he saw the little girl’s face approaching him, her full\nlips naïvely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her arms as thin as sticks\nheld him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl\nwept softly, pressing her face against him.\n\n“I am sorry for father,” she said a moment later, raising her\ntear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands. “It’s\nnothing but misfortunes now,” she added suddenly with that peculiarly\nsedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak\nlike grown-up people.\n\n“Did your father love you?”\n\n“He loved Lida most,” she went on very seriously without a smile,\nexactly like grown-up people, “he loved her because she is little and\nbecause she is ill, too. And he always used to bring her presents. But\nhe taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too,” she added with\ndignity. “And mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she\nliked it and father knew it, too. And mother wants to teach me French,\nfor it’s time my education began.”\n\n“And do you know your prayers?”\n\n“Of course, we do! We knew them long ago. I say my prayers to myself\nas I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.\nFirst they repeat the ‘Ave Maria’ and then another prayer: ‘Lord,\nforgive and bless sister Sonia,’ and then another, ‘Lord, forgive and\nbless our second father.’ For our elder father is dead and this is\nanother one, but we do pray for the other as well.”\n\n“Polenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me, too. ‘And Thy\nservant Rodion,’ nothing more.”\n\n“I’ll pray for you all the rest of my life,” the little girl declared\nhotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him\nwarmly once more.\n\nRaskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to\ncome next day. The child went away quite enchanted with him. It was past\nten when he came out into the street. In five minutes he was standing on\nthe bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in.\n\n“Enough,” he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. “I’ve done with\nfancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms! Life is real! haven’t I lived\njust now? My life has not yet died with that old woman! The Kingdom of\nHeaven to her--and now enough, madam, leave me in peace! Now for the\nreign of reason and light... and of will, and of strength... and now\nwe will see! We will try our strength!” he added defiantly, as though\nchallenging some power of darkness. “And I was ready to consent to live\nin a square of space!\n\n“I am very weak at this moment, but... I believe my illness is all over.\nI knew it would be over when I went out. By the way, Potchinkov’s house\nis only a few steps away. I certainly must go to Razumihin even if\nit were not close by... let him win his bet! Let us give him some\nsatisfaction, too--no matter! Strength, strength is what one wants, you\ncan get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength--that’s\nwhat they don’t know,” he added proudly and self-confidently and\nhe walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge. Pride and\nself-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becoming\na different man every moment. What was it had happened to work this\nrevolution in him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at a\nstraw, he suddenly felt that he, too, ‘could live, that there was still\nlife for him, that his life had not died with the old woman.’ Perhaps he\nwas in too great a hurry with his conclusions, but he did not think of\nthat.\n\n“But I did ask her to remember ‘Thy servant Rodion’ in her prayers,” the\nidea struck him. “Well, that was... in case of emergency,” he added and\nlaughed himself at his boyish sally. He was in the best of spirits.\n\nHe easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at\nPotchinkov’s and the porter at once showed him the way. Half-way\nupstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big\ngathering of people. The door was wide open on the stairs; he could\nhear exclamations and discussion. Razumihin’s room was fairly large; the\ncompany consisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the entry,\nwhere two of the landlady’s servants were busy behind a screen with two\nsamovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up\nfrom the landlady’s kitchen. Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran\nout delighted. At the first glance it was apparent that he had had a\ngreat deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite\ndrunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.\n\n“Listen,” Raskolnikov hastened to say, “I’ve only just come to tell you\nyou’ve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to\nhim. I can’t come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly. And\nso good evening and good-bye! Come and see me to-morrow.”\n\n“Do you know what? I’ll see you home. If you say you’re weak yourself,\nyou must...”\n\n“And your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped\nout?”\n\n“He? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncle’s, I expect, or perhaps\nhe has come without being invited... I’ll leave uncle with them, he\nis an invaluable person, pity I can’t introduce you to him now. But\nconfound them all now! They won’t notice me, and I need a little fresh\nair, for you’ve come just in the nick of time--another two minutes and I\nshould have come to blows! They are talking such a lot of wild stuff...\nyou simply can’t imagine what men will say! Though why shouldn’t you\nimagine? Don’t we talk nonsense ourselves? And let them... that’s the\nway to learn not to!... Wait a minute, I’ll fetch Zossimov.”\n\nZossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special\ninterest in him; soon his face brightened.\n\n“You must go to bed at once,” he pronounced, examining the patient as\nfar as he could, “and take something for the night. Will you take it? I\ngot it ready some time ago... a powder.”\n\n“Two, if you like,” answered Raskolnikov. The powder was taken at once.\n\n“It’s a good thing you are taking him home,” observed Zossimov to\nRazumihin--“we shall see how he is to-morrow, to-day he’s not at all\namiss--a considerable change since the afternoon. Live and learn...”\n\n“Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?”\n Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street. “I won’t tell\nyou everything, brother, because they are such fools. Zossimov told me\nto talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and\nafterwards I am to tell him about it, for he’s got a notion in his head\nthat you are... mad or close on it. Only fancy! In the first place,\nyou’ve three times the brains he has; in the second, if you are not mad,\nyou needn’t care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly,\nthat piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental\ndiseases, and what’s brought him to this conclusion about you was your\nconversation to-day with Zametov.”\n\n“Zametov told you all about it?”\n\n“Yes, and he did well. Now I understand what it all means and so does\nZametov.... Well, the fact is, Rodya... the point is... I am a little\ndrunk now.... But that’s... no matter... the point is that this\nidea... you understand? was just being hatched in their brains... you\nunderstand? That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea\nis too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that\nbubble’s burst and gone for ever. But why are they such fools? I gave\nZametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--that’s between ourselves,\nbrother; please don’t let out a hint that you know of it; I’ve noticed\nhe is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna’s. But to-day, to-day\nit’s all cleared up. That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it! He\ntook advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed\nof it himself now; I know that...”\n\nRaskolnikov listened greedily. Razumihin was drunk enough to talk too\nfreely.\n\n“I fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint,” said\nRaskolnikov.\n\n“No need to explain that! And it wasn’t the paint only: the fever had\nbeen coming on for a month; Zossimov testifies to that! But how crushed\nthat boy is now, you wouldn’t believe! ‘I am not worth his little\nfinger,’ he says. Yours, he means. He has good feelings at times,\nbrother. But the lesson, the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palais\nde Cristal, that was too good for anything! You frightened him at first,\nyou know, he nearly went into convulsions! You almost convinced\nhim again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, and then you\nsuddenly--put out your tongue at him: ‘There now, what do you make of\nit?’ It was perfect! He is crushed, annihilated now! It was masterly, by\nJove, it’s what they deserve! Ah, that I wasn’t there! He was hoping to\nsee you awfully. Porfiry, too, wants to make your acquaintance...”\n\n“Ah!... he too... but why did they put me down as mad?”\n\n“Oh, not mad. I must have said too much, brother.... What struck him,\nyou see, was that only that subject seemed to interest you; now it’s\nclear why it did interest you; knowing all the circumstances... and\nhow that irritated you and worked in with your illness... I am a little\ndrunk, brother, only, confound him, he has some idea of his own... I\ntell you, he’s mad on mental diseases. But don’t you mind him...”\n\nFor half a minute both were silent.\n\n“Listen, Razumihin,” began Raskolnikov, “I want to tell you plainly:\nI’ve just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died... I gave them all my\nmoney... and besides I’ve just been kissed by someone who, if I had\nkilled anyone, would just the same... in fact I saw someone else\nthere... with a flame-coloured feather... but I am talking nonsense; I\nam very weak, support me... we shall be at the stairs directly...”\n\n“What’s the matter? What’s the matter with you?” Razumihin asked\nanxiously.\n\n“I am a little giddy, but that’s not the point, I am so sad, so sad...\nlike a woman. Look, what’s that? Look, look!”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Don’t you see? A light in my room, you see? Through the crack...”\n\nThey were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at the level\nof the landlady’s door, and they could, as a fact, see from below that\nthere was a light in Raskolnikov’s garret.\n\n“Queer! Nastasya, perhaps,” observed Razumihin.\n\n“She is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago,\nbut... I don’t care! Good-bye!”\n\n“What do you mean? I am coming with you, we’ll come in together!”\n\n“I know we are going in together, but I want to shake hands here and say\ngood-bye to you here. So give me your hand, good-bye!”\n\n“What’s the matter with you, Rodya?”\n\n“Nothing... come along... you shall be witness.”\n\nThey began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck Razumihin that\nperhaps Zossimov might be right after all. “Ah, I’ve upset him with my\nchatter!” he muttered to himself.\n\nWhen they reached the door they heard voices in the room.\n\n“What is it?” cried Razumihin. Raskolnikov was the first to open the\ndoor; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered.\n\nHis mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an\nhour and a half for him. Why had he never expected, never thought of\nthem, though the news that they had started, were on their way and would\narrive immediately, had been repeated to him only that day? They had\nspent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She was\nstanding before them and had told them everything by now. They were\nbeside themselves with alarm when they heard of his “running away”\n to-day, ill and, as they understood from her story, delirious! “Good\nHeavens, what had become of him?” Both had been weeping, both had been\nin anguish for that hour and a half.\n\nA cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov’s entrance. Both rushed to\nhim. But he stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck\nhim like a thunderbolt. He did not lift his arms to embrace them, he\ncould not. His mother and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him,\nlaughed and cried. He took a step, tottered and fell to the ground,\nfainting.\n\nAnxiety, cries of horror, moans... Razumihin who was standing in the\ndoorway flew into the room, seized the sick man in his strong arms and\nin a moment had him on the sofa.\n\n“It’s nothing, nothing!” he cried to the mother and sister--“it’s only a\nfaint, a mere trifle! Only just now the doctor said he was much better,\nthat he is perfectly well! Water! See, he is coming to himself, he is\nall right again!”\n\nAnd seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it, he made\nher bend down to see that “he is all right again.” The mother and sister\nlooked on him with emotion and gratitude, as their Providence. They\nhad heard already from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya\nduring his illness, by this “very competent young man,” as Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna Raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with\nDounia.\n\n\n\n\nPART III\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nRaskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa. He waved his hand weakly\nto Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations\nhe was addressing to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand\nand for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking.\nHis mother was alarmed by his expression. It revealed an emotion\nagonisingly poignant, and at the same time something immovable, almost\ninsane. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.\n\nAvdotya Romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her brother’s.\n\n“Go home... with him,” he said in a broken voice, pointing to Razumihin,\n“good-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow everything... Is it long since you\narrived?”\n\n“This evening, Rodya,” answered Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “the train was\nawfully late. But, Rodya, nothing would induce me to leave you now! I\nwill spend the night here, near you...”\n\n“Don’t torture me!” he said with a gesture of irritation.\n\n“I will stay with him,” cried Razumihin, “I won’t leave him for a\nmoment. Bother all my visitors! Let them rage to their hearts’ content!\nMy uncle is presiding there.”\n\n“How, how can I thank you!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning, once\nmore pressing Razumihin’s hands, but Raskolnikov interrupted her again.\n\n“I can’t have it! I can’t have it!” he repeated irritably, “don’t worry\nme! Enough, go away... I can’t stand it!”\n\n“Come, mamma, come out of the room at least for a minute,” Dounia\nwhispered in dismay; “we are distressing him, that’s evident.”\n\n“Mayn’t I look at him after three years?” wept Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\n\n“Stay,” he stopped them again, “you keep interrupting me, and my ideas\nget muddled.... Have you seen Luzhin?”\n\n“No, Rodya, but he knows already of our arrival. We have heard, Rodya,\nthat Pyotr Petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today,” Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna added somewhat timidly.\n\n“Yes... he was so kind... Dounia, I promised Luzhin I’d throw him\ndownstairs and told him to go to hell....”\n\n“Rodya, what are you saying! Surely, you don’t mean to tell us...”\n Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she stopped, looking at\nDounia.\n\nAvdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her brother, waiting\nfor what would come next. Both of them had heard of the quarrel from\nNastasya, so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it,\nand were in painful perplexity and suspense.\n\n“Dounia,” Raskolnikov continued with an effort, “I don’t want that\nmarriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse Luzhin,\nso that we may never hear his name again.”\n\n“Good Heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\n\n“Brother, think what you are saying!” Avdotya Romanovna began\nimpetuously, but immediately checked herself. “You are not fit to talk\nnow, perhaps; you are tired,” she added gently.\n\n“You think I am delirious? No... You are marrying Luzhin for _my_\nsake. But I won’t accept the sacrifice. And so write a letter before\nto-morrow, to refuse him... Let me read it in the morning and that will\nbe the end of it!”\n\n“That I can’t do!” the girl cried, offended, “what right have you...”\n\n“Dounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow... Don’t you see...”\n the mother interposed in dismay. “Better come away!”\n\n“He is raving,” Razumihin cried tipsily, “or how would he dare!\nTo-morrow all this nonsense will be over... to-day he certainly did\ndrive him away. That was so. And Luzhin got angry, too.... He made\nspeeches here, wanted to show off his learning and he went out\ncrest-fallen....”\n\n“Then it’s true?” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\n\n“Good-bye till to-morrow, brother,” said Dounia compassionately--“let us\ngo, mother... Good-bye, Rodya.”\n\n“Do you hear, sister,” he repeated after them, making a last effort,\n“I am not delirious; this marriage is--an infamy. Let me act like\na scoundrel, but you mustn’t... one is enough... and though I am a\nscoundrel, I wouldn’t own such a sister. It’s me or Luzhin! Go now....”\n\n“But you’re out of your mind! Despot!” roared Razumihin; but Raskolnikov\ndid not and perhaps could not answer. He lay down on the sofa, and\nturned to the wall, utterly exhausted. Avdotya Romanovna looked with\ninterest at Razumihin; her black eyes flashed; Razumihin positively\nstarted at her glance.\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.\n\n“Nothing would induce me to go,” she whispered in despair to Razumihin.\n“I will stay somewhere here... escort Dounia home.”\n\n“You’ll spoil everything,” Razumihin answered in the same whisper,\nlosing patience--“come out on to the stairs, anyway. Nastasya, show a\nlight! I assure you,” he went on in a half whisper on the stairs--“that\nhe was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you\nunderstand? The doctor himself! Even he gave way and left him, so as not\nto irritate him. I remained downstairs on guard, but he dressed at once\nand slipped off. And he will slip off again if you irritate him, at this\ntime of night, and will do himself some mischief....”\n\n“What are you saying?”\n\n“And Avdotya Romanovna can’t possibly be left in those lodgings without\nyou. Just think where you are staying! That blackguard Pyotr Petrovitch\ncouldn’t find you better lodgings... But you know I’ve had a little to\ndrink, and that’s what makes me... swear; don’t mind it....”\n\n“But I’ll go to the landlady here,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted,\n“I’ll beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and me for the night. I\ncan’t leave him like that, I cannot!”\n\nThis conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady’s\ndoor. Nastasya lighted them from a step below. Razumihin was in\nextraordinary excitement. Half an hour earlier, while he was bringing\nRaskolnikov home, he had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of\nit himself, and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he\nhad imbibed. Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he\nhad drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect. He stood with\nthe two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and giving\nthem reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every\nword he uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed their\nhands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the\nleast regard for good manners. They sometimes pulled their hands out of\nhis huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew\nthem all the closer to him. If they’d told him to jump head foremost\nfrom the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitation\nin their service. Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man\nwas really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety\nover her Rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and was\nunwilling to notice all his peculiarities. But though Avdotya Romanovna\nshared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could not\nsee the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm. It\nwas only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya’s account of her\nbrother’s queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away from\nhim, and to persuade her mother to do the same. She realised, too,\nthat even running away was perhaps impossible now. Ten minutes later,\nhowever, she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of\nRazumihin that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he might\nbe in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with.\n\n“You can’t go to the landlady, that’s perfect nonsense!” he cried. “If\nyou stay, though you are his mother, you’ll drive him to a frenzy, and\nthen goodness knows what will happen! Listen, I’ll tell you what I’ll\ndo: Nastasya will stay with him now, and I’ll conduct you both home, you\ncan’t be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that\nway.... But no matter! Then I’ll run straight back here and a quarter of\nan hour later, on my word of honour, I’ll bring you news how he is,\nwhether he is asleep, and all that. Then, listen! Then I’ll run home in\na twinkling--I’ve a lot of friends there, all drunk--I’ll fetch\nZossimov--that’s the doctor who is looking after him, he is there, too,\nbut he is not drunk; he is not drunk, he is never drunk! I’ll drag him\nto Rodya, and then to you, so that you’ll get two reports in the\nhour--from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that’s a\nvery different thing from my account of him! If there’s anything wrong,\nI swear I’ll bring you here myself, but, if it’s all right, you go to\nbed. And I’ll spend the night here, in the passage, he won’t hear me,\nand I’ll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady’s, to be at hand. Which\nis better for him: you or the doctor? So come home then! But the\nlandlady is out of the question; it’s all right for me, but it’s out of\nthe question for you: she wouldn’t take you, for she’s... for she’s a\nfool... She’d be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you,\ntoo, if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly. She is an\nabsolutely, absolutely unaccountable character! But I am a fool, too!...\nNo matter! Come along! Do you trust me? Come, do you trust me or not?”\n\n“Let us go, mother,” said Avdotya Romanovna, “he will certainly do what\nhe has promised. He has saved Rodya already, and if the doctor really\nwill consent to spend the night here, what could be better?”\n\n“You see, you... you... understand me, because you are an angel!”\n Razumihin cried in ecstasy, “let us go! Nastasya! Fly upstairs and sit\nwith him with a light; I’ll come in a quarter of an hour.”\n\nThough Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made no\nfurther resistance. Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down\nthe stairs. He still made her uneasy, as though he was competent and\ngood-natured, was he capable of carrying out his promise? He seemed in\nsuch a condition....\n\n“Ah, I see you think I am in such a condition!” Razumihin broke in upon\nher thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled along the pavement with huge\nsteps, so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him, a fact he\ndid not observe, however. “Nonsense! That is... I am drunk like a fool,\nbut that’s not it; I am not drunk from wine. It’s seeing you has turned\nmy head... But don’t mind me! Don’t take any notice: I am talking\nnonsense, I am not worthy of you.... I am utterly unworthy of you! The\nminute I’ve taken you home, I’ll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over\nmy head in the gutter here, and then I shall be all right.... If only\nyou knew how I love you both! Don’t laugh, and don’t be angry! You may\nbe angry with anyone, but not with me! I am his friend, and therefore I\nam your friend, too, I want to be... I had a presentiment... Last year\nthere was a moment... though it wasn’t a presentiment really, for\nyou seem to have fallen from heaven. And I expect I shan’t sleep all\nnight... Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad...\nthat’s why he mustn’t be irritated.”\n\n“What do you say?” cried the mother.\n\n“Did the doctor really say that?” asked Avdotya Romanovna, alarmed.\n\n“Yes, but it’s not so, not a bit of it. He gave him some medicine, a\npowder, I saw it, and then your coming here.... Ah! It would have been\nbetter if you had come to-morrow. It’s a good thing we went away. And in\nan hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything. He is not\ndrunk! And I shan’t be drunk.... And what made me get so tight? Because\nthey got me into an argument, damn them! I’ve sworn never to argue! They\ntalk such trash! I almost came to blows! I’ve left my uncle to preside.\nWould you believe, they insist on complete absence of individualism\nand that’s just what they relish! Not to be themselves, to be as unlike\nthemselves as they can. That’s what they regard as the highest point of\nprogress. If only their nonsense were their own, but as it is...”\n\n“Listen!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly, but it only added\nfuel to the flames.\n\n“What do you think?” shouted Razumihin, louder than ever, “you think I\nam attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit! I like them to talk\nnonsense. That’s man’s one privilege over all creation. Through error\nyou come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any\ntruth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and\nfourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can’t even make\nmistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense,\nand I’ll kiss you for it. To go wrong in one’s own way is better than\nto go right in someone else’s. In the first case you are a man, in the\nsecond you’re no better than a bird. Truth won’t escape you, but life\ncan be cramped. There have been examples. And what are we doing now?\nIn science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism,\njudgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we are\nstill in the preparatory class at school. We prefer to live on other\npeople’s ideas, it’s what we are used to! Am I right, am I right?” cried\nRazumihin, pressing and shaking the two ladies’ hands.\n\n“Oh, mercy, I do not know,” cried poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\n\n“Yes, yes... though I don’t agree with you in everything,” added Avdotya\nRomanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry, for he squeezed her hand\nso painfully.\n\n“Yes, you say yes... well after that you... you...” he cried in\na transport, “you are a fount of goodness, purity, sense... and\nperfection. Give me your hand... you give me yours, too! I want to kiss\nyour hands here at once, on my knees...” and he fell on his knees on the\npavement, fortunately at that time deserted.\n\n“Leave off, I entreat you, what are you doing?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\ncried, greatly distressed.\n\n“Get up, get up!” said Dounia laughing, though she, too, was upset.\n\n“Not for anything till you let me kiss your hands! That’s it! Enough! I\nget up and we’ll go on! I am a luckless fool, I am unworthy of you and\ndrunk... and I am ashamed.... I am not worthy to love you, but to do\nhomage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast! And\nI’ve done homage.... Here are your lodgings, and for that alone Rodya\nwas right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away.... How dare he! how\ndare he put you in such lodgings! It’s a scandal! Do you know the\nsort of people they take in here? And you his betrothed! You are\nhis betrothed? Yes? Well, then, I’ll tell you, your _fiancé_ is a\nscoundrel.”\n\n“Excuse me, Mr. Razumihin, you are forgetting...” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\nwas beginning.\n\n“Yes, yes, you are right, I did forget myself, I am ashamed of it,”\n Razumihin made haste to apologise. “But... but you can’t be angry with\nme for speaking so! For I speak sincerely and not because... hm, hm!\nThat would be disgraceful; in fact not because I’m in... hm! Well,\nanyway, I won’t say why, I daren’t.... But we all saw to-day when he\ncame in that that man is not of our sort. Not because he had his hair\ncurled at the barber’s, not because he was in such a hurry to show his\nwit, but because he is a spy, a speculator, because he is a skin-flint\nand a buffoon. That’s evident. Do you think him clever? No, he is a\nfool, a fool. And is he a match for you? Good heavens! Do you see,\nladies?” he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms, “though\nall my friends there are drunk, yet they are all honest, and though we\ndo talk a lot of trash, and I do, too, yet we shall talk our way to the\ntruth at last, for we are on the right path, while Pyotr Petrovitch...\nis not on the right path. Though I’ve been calling them all sorts of\nnames just now, I do respect them all... though I don’t respect Zametov,\nI like him, for he is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because he\nis an honest man and knows his work. But enough, it’s all said and\nforgiven. Is it forgiven? Well, then, let’s go on. I know this corridor,\nI’ve been here, there was a scandal here at Number 3.... Where are you\nhere? Which number? eight? Well, lock yourselves in for the night, then.\nDon’t let anybody in. In a quarter of an hour I’ll come back with news,\nand half an hour later I’ll bring Zossimov, you’ll see! Good-bye, I’ll\nrun.”\n\n“Good heavens, Dounia, what is going to happen?” said Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna, addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay.\n\n“Don’t worry yourself, mother,” said Dounia, taking off her hat and\ncape. “God has sent this gentleman to our aid, though he has come from a\ndrinking party. We can depend on him, I assure you. And all that he has\ndone for Rodya....”\n\n“Ah. Dounia, goodness knows whether he will come! How could I bring\nmyself to leave Rodya?... And how different, how different I had fancied\nour meeting! How sullen he was, as though not pleased to see us....”\n\nTears came into her eyes.\n\n“No, it’s not that, mother. You didn’t see, you were crying all the\ntime. He is quite unhinged by serious illness--that’s the reason.”\n\n“Ah, that illness! What will happen, what will happen? And how he talked\nto you, Dounia!” said the mother, looking timidly at her daughter,\ntrying to read her thoughts and, already half consoled by Dounia’s\nstanding up for her brother, which meant that she had already forgiven\nhim. “I am sure he will think better of it to-morrow,” she added,\nprobing her further.\n\n“And I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow... about that,”\n Avdotya Romanovna said finally. And, of course, there was no going\nbeyond that, for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\nafraid to discuss. Dounia went up and kissed her mother. The latter\nwarmly embraced her without speaking. Then she sat down to wait\nanxiously for Razumihin’s return, timidly watching her daughter who\nwalked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in thought.\nThis walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of Avdotya\nRomanovna’s and the mother was always afraid to break in on her\ndaughter’s mood at such moments.\n\nRazumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation\nfor Avdotya Romanovna. Yet apart from his eccentric condition, many\npeople would have thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya\nRomanovna, especially at that moment when she was walking to and\nfro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy. Avdotya Romanovna was\nremarkably good-looking; she was tall, strikingly well-proportioned,\nstrong and self-reliant--the latter quality was apparent in every\ngesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and\nsoftness of her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but she\nmight be described as really beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, a\nlittle lighter than her brother’s; there was a proud light in her almost\nblack eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness. She was\npale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness\nand vigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected\na little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful\nface, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty\nexpression. Her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay;\nbut how well smiles, how well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible,\nlaughter suited her face! It was natural enough that a warm, open,\nsimple-hearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen anyone\nlike her and was not quite sober at the time, should lose his head\nimmediately. Besides, as chance would have it, he saw Dounia for the\nfirst time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at\nmeeting him. Afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation\nat her brother’s insolent, cruel and ungrateful words--and his fate was\nsealed.\n\nHe had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunken\ntalk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikov’s eccentric\nlandlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of\nAvdotya Romanovna on his account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\nforty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she\nlooked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the\ncase with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure\nsincere warmth of heart to old age. We may add in parenthesis that to\npreserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age. Her\nhair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow’s\nfoot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from\nanxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face. She was Dounia\nover again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip.\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and\nyielding, but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept a\ngreat deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a\ncertain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions\nwhich nothing would induce her to cross.\n\nExactly twenty minutes after Razumihin’s departure, there came two\nsubdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back.\n\n“I won’t come in, I haven’t time,” he hastened to say when the door was\nopened. “He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he may\nsleep ten hours. Nastasya’s with him; I told her not to leave till I\ncame. Now I am fetching Zossimov, he will report to you and then you’d\nbetter turn in; I can see you are too tired to do anything....”\n\nAnd he ran off down the corridor.\n\n“What a very competent and... devoted young man!” cried Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna exceedingly delighted.\n\n“He seems a splendid person!” Avdotya Romanovna replied with some\nwarmth, resuming her walk up and down the room.\n\nIt was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor\nand another knock at the door. Both women waited this time completely\nrelying on Razumihin’s promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing\nZossimov. Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to\ngo to Raskolnikov’s, but he came reluctantly and with the greatest\nsuspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated\ncondition. But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw\nthat they were really expecting him as an oracle. He stayed just ten\nminutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna. He spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and\nextreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation.\nHe did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the\nslightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two\nladies. Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya\nRomanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and\naddressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna. All this gave him\nextraordinary inward satisfaction. He declared that he thought the\ninvalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. According to his\nobservations the patient’s illness was due partly to his unfortunate\nmaterial surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also\na moral origin, “was, so to speak, the product of several material and\nmoral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas...\nand so on.” Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following his\nwords with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this\ntheme. On Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s anxiously and timidly inquiring as\nto “some suspicion of insanity,” he replied with a composed and candid\nsmile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient\nhad some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he, Zossimov,\nwas now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but\nthat it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in\ndelirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have\na favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, “if only all\nfresh shocks can be avoided,” he added significantly. Then he got up,\ntook leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm\ngratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and Avdotya Romanovna\nspontaneously offered her hand to him. He went out exceedingly pleased\nwith his visit and still more so with himself.\n\n“We’ll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!” Razumihin said in conclusion,\nfollowing Zossimov out. “I’ll be with you to-morrow morning as early as\npossible with my report.”\n\n“That’s a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna,” remarked Zossimov,\nalmost licking his lips as they both came out into the street.\n\n“Fetching? You said fetching?” roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimov\nand seized him by the throat. “If you ever dare.... Do you understand?\nDo you understand?” he shouted, shaking him by the collar and squeezing\nhim against the wall. “Do you hear?”\n\n“Let me go, you drunken devil,” said Zossimov, struggling and when he\nhad let him go, he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw.\nRazumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.\n\n“Of course, I am an ass,” he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, “but\nstill... you are another.”\n\n“No, brother, not at all such another. I am not dreaming of any folly.”\n\nThey walked along in silence and only when they were close to\nRaskolnikov’s lodgings, Razumihin broke the silence in considerable\nanxiety.\n\n“Listen,” he said, “you’re a first-rate fellow, but among your other\nfailings, you’re a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty one, too. You\nare a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of whims, you’re getting fat\nand lazy and can’t deny yourself anything--and I call that dirty because\nit leads one straight into the dirt. You’ve let yourself get so slack\nthat I don’t know how it is you are still a good, even a devoted doctor.\nYou--a doctor--sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your\npatients! In another three or four years you won’t get up for your\npatients... But hang it all, that’s not the point!... You are going\nto spend to-night in the landlady’s flat here. (Hard work I’ve had to\npersuade her!) And I’ll be in the kitchen. So here’s a chance for you to\nget to know her better.... It’s not as you think! There’s not a trace of\nanything of the sort, brother...!”\n\n“But I don’t think!”\n\n“Here you have modesty, brother, silence, bashfulness, a savage\nvirtue... and yet she’s sighing and melting like wax, simply melting!\nSave me from her, by all that’s unholy! She’s most prepossessing... I’ll\nrepay you, I’ll do anything....”\n\nZossimov laughed more violently than ever.\n\n“Well, you are smitten! But what am I to do with her?”\n\n“It won’t be much trouble, I assure you. Talk any rot you like to her,\nas long as you sit by her and talk. You’re a doctor, too; try curing\nher of something. I swear you won’t regret it. She has a piano, and you\nknow, I strum a little. I have a song there, a genuine Russian one: ‘I\nshed hot tears.’ She likes the genuine article--and well, it all\nbegan with that song; Now you’re a regular performer, a _maître_, a\nRubinstein.... I assure you, you won’t regret it!”\n\n“But have you made her some promise? Something signed? A promise of\nmarriage, perhaps?”\n\n“Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of the kind! Besides she is not\nthat sort at all.... Tchebarov tried that....”\n\n“Well then, drop her!”\n\n“But I can’t drop her like that!”\n\n“Why can’t you?”\n\n“Well, I can’t, that’s all about it! There’s an element of attraction\nhere, brother.”\n\n“Then why have you fascinated her?”\n\n“I haven’t fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated myself in my folly.\nBut she won’t care a straw whether it’s you or I, so long as somebody\nsits beside her, sighing.... I can’t explain the position, brother...\nlook here, you are good at mathematics, and working at it now... begin\nteaching her the integral calculus; upon my soul, I’m not joking, I’m\nin earnest, it’ll be just the same to her. She will gaze at you and sigh\nfor a whole year together. I talked to her once for two days at a time\nabout the Prussian House of Lords (for one must talk of something)--she\njust sighed and perspired! And you mustn’t talk of love--she’s bashful\nto hysterics--but just let her see you can’t tear yourself away--that’s\nenough. It’s fearfully comfortable; you’re quite at home, you can\nread, sit, lie about, write. You may even venture on a kiss, if you’re\ncareful.”\n\n“But what do I want with her?”\n\n“Ach, I can’t make you understand! You see, you are made for each other!\nI have often been reminded of you!... You’ll come to it in the end! So\ndoes it matter whether it’s sooner or later? There’s the feather-bed\nelement here, brother--ach! and not only that! There’s an attraction\nhere--here you have the end of the world, an anchorage, a quiet haven,\nthe navel of the earth, the three fishes that are the foundation of the\nworld, the essence of pancakes, of savoury fish-pies, of the evening\nsamovar, of soft sighs and warm shawls, and hot stoves to sleep on--as\nsnug as though you were dead, and yet you’re alive--the advantages\nof both at once! Well, hang it, brother, what stuff I’m talking, it’s\nbedtime! Listen. I sometimes wake up at night; so I’ll go in and look at\nhim. But there’s no need, it’s all right. Don’t you worry yourself,\nyet if you like, you might just look in once, too. But if you notice\nanything--delirium or fever--wake me at once. But there can’t be....”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nRazumihin waked up next morning at eight o’clock, troubled and serious.\nHe found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.\nHe had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. He\nremembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly\nnovel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impression\nunlike anything he had known before. At the same time he recognised\nclearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly\nunattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and\nhe hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties\nbequeathed him by that “thrice accursed yesterday.”\n\nThe most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown\nhimself “base and mean,” not only because he had been drunk, but\nbecause he had taken advantage of the young girl’s position to abuse\nher _fiancé_ in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual\nrelations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself. And\nwhat right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?\nWho had asked for his opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature as\nAvdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money? So there\nmust be something in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he know\nthe character of the lodgings? He was furnishing a flat... Foo! how\ndespicable it all was! And what justification was it that he was drunk?\nSuch a stupid excuse was even more degrading! In wine is truth, and the\ntruth had all come out, “that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse\nand envious heart”! And would such a dream ever be permissible to\nhim, Razumihin? What was he beside such a girl--he, the drunken noisy\nbraggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical\na juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and\nsuddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had\nsaid last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of\nAvdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable. He brought his fist\ndown heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of the\nbricks flying.\n\n“Of course,” he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of\nself-abasement, “of course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or\nsmoothed over... and so it’s useless even to think of it, and I must\ngo to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not ask\nforgiveness, and say nothing... for all is lost now!”\n\nAnd yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual.\nHe hadn’t another suit--if he had had, perhaps he wouldn’t have put it\non. “I would have made a point of not putting it on.” But in any case he\ncould not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend\nthe feelings of others, especially when they were in need of his\nassistance and asking him to see them. He brushed his clothes carefully.\nHis linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean.\n\nHe washed that morning scrupulously--he got some soap from Nastasya--he\nwashed his hair, his neck and especially his hands. When it came to the\nquestion whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna\nhad capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the question\nwas angrily answered in the negative. “Let it stay as it is! What if\nthey think that I shaved on purpose to...? They certainly would think\nso! Not on any account!”\n\n“And... the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had the\nmanners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he had\nsome of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to be\nproud of? Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and all\nthe same (he remembered) he, too, had done little things... not exactly\ndishonest, and yet.... And what thoughts he sometimes had; hm... and to\nset all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! Confound it! So be it! Well, he’d\nmake a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he\nwouldn’t care! He’d be worse!”\n\nHe was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, who had spent the night\nin Praskovya Pavlovna’s parlour, came in.\n\nHe was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.\nRazumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse.\nZossimov gave orders that they shouldn’t wake him and promised to see\nhim again about eleven.\n\n“If he is still at home,” he added. “Damn it all! If one can’t control\none’s patients, how is one to cure them? Do you know whether _he_ will\ngo to them, or whether _they_ are coming here?”\n\n“They are coming, I think,” said Razumihin, understanding the object\nof the question, “and they will discuss their family affairs, no doubt.\nI’ll be off. You, as the doctor, have more right to be here than I.”\n\n“But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; I’ve plenty\nto do besides looking after them.”\n\n“One thing worries me,” interposed Razumihin, frowning. “On the way home\nI talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him... all sorts of things... and\namongst them that you were afraid that he... might become insane.”\n\n“You told the ladies so, too.”\n\n“I know it was stupid! You may beat me if you like! Did you think so\nseriously?”\n\n“That’s nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it seriously? You,\nyourself, described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to\nhim... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday, you did, that is, with\nyour story about the painter; it was a nice conversation, when he was,\nperhaps, mad on that very point! If only I’d known what happened then\nat the police station and that some wretch... had insulted him with this\nsuspicion! Hm... I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday.\nThese monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill... and\nsee their fancies as solid realities.... As far as I remember, it was\nZametov’s story that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind. Why, I\nknow one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat\nof a little boy of eight, because he couldn’t endure the jokes he made\nevery day at table! And in this case his rags, the insolent police\nofficer, the fever and this suspicion! All that working upon a man half\nfrantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity! That\nmay well have been the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it\nall!... And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but\nhm... he shouldn’t have told all that last night. He is an awful\nchatterbox!”\n\n“But whom did he tell it to? You and me?”\n\n“And Porfiry.”\n\n“What does that matter?”\n\n“And, by the way, have you any influence on them, his mother and sister?\nTell them to be more careful with him to-day....”\n\n“They’ll get on all right!” Razumihin answered reluctantly.\n\n“Why is he so set against this Luzhin? A man with money and she doesn’t\nseem to dislike him... and they haven’t a farthing, I suppose? eh?”\n\n“But what business is it of yours?” Razumihin cried with annoyance. “How\ncan I tell whether they’ve a farthing? Ask them yourself and perhaps\nyou’ll find out....”\n\n“Foo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last night’s wine has not gone off\nyet.... Good-bye; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my night’s\nlodging. She locked herself in, made no reply to my _bonjour_ through\nthe door; she was up at seven o’clock, the samovar was taken into her\nfrom the kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview....”\n\nAt nine o’clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev’s\nhouse. Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience. They\nhad risen at seven o’clock or earlier. He entered looking as black as\nnight, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He\nhad reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at\nhim, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them. He glanced\ntimidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at that\nmoment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such\ncomplete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and\nill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greater\nconfusion than if he had been met with abuse. Fortunately there was a\nsubject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it.\n\nHearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked,\nPulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because\n“she had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over\nbeforehand.” Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation\nto have it with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya\nRomanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and\nthey asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such\na dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. Razumihin\nvigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped\nin embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s\nquestions, which showered in a continual stream upon him.\n\nHe talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted\nby their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the\nmost important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikov’s life,\nconcluding with a circumstantial account of his illness. He omitted,\nhowever, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at\nthe police station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly\nto his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied his\nlisteners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun.\n\n“Tell me, tell me! What do you think...? Excuse me, I still don’t know\nyour name!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily.\n\n“Dmitri Prokofitch.”\n\n“I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch... how he\nlooks... on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what are\nhis likes and dislikes? Is he always so irritable? Tell me, if you can,\nwhat are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams? Under what influences is\nhe now? In a word, I should like...”\n\n“Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?” observed Dounia.\n\n“Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least like this,\nDmitri Prokofitch!”\n\n“Naturally,” answered Razumihin. “I have no mother, but my uncle comes\nevery year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even in\nappearance, though he is a clever man; and your three years’ separation\nmeans a great deal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for\na year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of\nlate--and perhaps for a long time before--he has been suspicious and\nfanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind heart. He does not like\nshowing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his\nheart freely. Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply\ncold and inhumanly callous; it’s as though he were alternating between\ntwo characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says he is\nso busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing\nnothing. He doesn’t jeer at things, not because he hasn’t the wit, but\nas though he hadn’t time to waste on such trifles. He never listens\nto what is said to him. He is never interested in what interests other\npeople at any given moment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps\nhe is right. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most\nbeneficial influence upon him.”\n\n“God grant it may,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, distressed by\nRazumihin’s account of her Rodya.\n\nAnd Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.\nHe glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and\nlooked away again at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening\nattentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her\narms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question,\nwithout stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening to\nwhat was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a\nwhite transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of\nextreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed\nlike a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps\njust because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery\nof her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be\nafraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very\ntrying for a man who already felt diffident.\n\n“You’ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother’s\ncharacter... and have told it impartially. I am glad. I thought that you\nwere too uncritically devoted to him,” observed Avdotya Romanovna with\na smile. “I think you are right that he needs a woman’s care,” she added\nthoughtfully.\n\n“I didn’t say so; but I daresay you are right, only...”\n\n“What?”\n\n“He loves no one and perhaps he never will,” Razumihin declared\ndecisively.\n\n“You mean he is not capable of love?”\n\n“Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in\neverything, indeed!” he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but\nremembering at once what he had just before said of her brother,\nhe turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion. Avdotya\nRomanovna couldn’t help laughing when she looked at him.\n\n“You may both be mistaken about Rodya,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked,\nslightly piqued. “I am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia.\nWhat Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have\nsupposed may be mistaken, but you can’t imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how\nmoody and, so to say, capricious he is. I never could depend on what\nhe would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he might\ndo something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well, for\ninstance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave\nme a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that\ngirl--what was her name--his landlady’s daughter?”\n\n“Did you hear about that affair?” asked Avdotya Romanovna.\n\n“Do you suppose----” Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly. “Do you\nsuppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from\ngrief, our poverty would have made him pause? No, he would calmly have\ndisregarded all obstacles. And yet it isn’t that he doesn’t love us!”\n\n“He has never spoken a word of that affair to me,” Razumihin answered\ncautiously. “But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself,\nthough she is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly was\nrather strange.”\n\n“And what did you hear?” both the ladies asked at once.\n\n“Well, nothing very special. I only learned that the marriage, which\nonly failed to take place through the girl’s death, was not at all to\nPraskovya Pavlovna’s liking. They say, too, the girl was not at all\npretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and\nqueer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must have\nhad some good qualities or it’s quite inexplicable.... She had no money\neither and he wouldn’t have considered her money.... But it’s always\ndifficult to judge in such matters.”\n\n“I am sure she was a good girl,” Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly.\n\n“God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I don’t know\nwhich of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to her\nor she to him,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded. Then she began\ntentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with\nLuzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to\nthe latter’s annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidently\ncaused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razumihin described it in\ndetail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly\nblamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not\nseeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.\n\n“He had planned it before his illness,” he added.\n\n“I think so, too,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.\nBut she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself\nso carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch.\nAvdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it.\n\n“So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\ncould not resist asking.\n\n“I can have no other opinion of your daughter’s future husband,”\n Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, “and I don’t say it simply\nfrom vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna\nhas of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so\nrudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...\nmad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and this\nmorning I am ashamed of it.”\n\nHe crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not\nbreak the silence. She had not uttered a word from the moment they began\nto speak of Luzhin.\n\nWithout her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what\nto do. At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she\nconfessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.\n\n“You see, Dmitri Prokofitch,” she began. “I’ll be perfectly open with\nDmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?”\n\n“Of course, mother,” said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically.\n\n“This is what it is,” she began in haste, as though the permission to\nspeak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. “Very early this\nmorning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter\nannouncing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station, you\nknow; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these\nlodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would\nbe here himself this morning. But this morning this note came from him.\nYou’d better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me\nvery much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid\nopinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya’s character better than\nanyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dounia, I must tell\nyou, made her decision at once, but I still don’t feel sure how to act\nand I... I’ve been waiting for your opinion.”\n\nRazumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read\nas follows:\n\n“Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you\nthat owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at\nthe railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object\nin view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with\nyou to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of\ndelay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you\nare meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. I shall have\nthe honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings\nnot later than to-morrow evening at eight o’clock precisely, and\nherewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative\nrequest that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as\nhe offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my\nvisit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire\nfrom you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation\nupon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own\ninterpretation. I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation,\nthat if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be\ncompelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to\nblame. I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so\nill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able\nto leave the house, may visit you also. I was confirmed in that belief\nby the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who\nwas run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of\nnotorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the\nfuneral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to\nraise that sum. Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable\ndaughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage\nof\n\n“Your humble servant,\n\n“P. LUZHIN.”\n\n\n“What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?” began Pulcheria Alexandrovna,\nalmost weeping. “How can I ask Rodya not to come? Yesterday he insisted\nso earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not\nto receive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will\nhappen then?”\n\n“Act on Avdotya Romanovna’s decision,” Razumihin answered calmly at\nonce.\n\n“Oh, dear me! She says... goodness knows what she says, she doesn’t\nexplain her object! She says that it would be best, at least, not that\nit would be best, but that it’s absolutely necessary that Rodya should\nmake a point of being here at eight o’clock and that they must meet....\nI didn’t want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him\nfrom coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so\nirritable.... Besides I don’t understand about that drunkard who died\nand that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all the\nmoney... which...”\n\n“Which cost you such sacrifice, mother,” put in Avdotya Romanovna.\n\n“He was not himself yesterday,” Razumihin said thoughtfully, “if you\nonly knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though there\nwas sense in it too.... Hm! He did say something, as we were going home\nyesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn’t understand\na word.... But last night, I myself...”\n\n“The best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him ourselves and\nthere I assure you we shall see at once what’s to be done. Besides,\nit’s getting late--good heavens, it’s past ten,” she cried looking at\na splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin\nVenetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her\ndress. “A present from her _fiancé_,” thought Razumihin.\n\n“We must start, Dounia, we must start,” her mother cried in a flutter.\n“He will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday, from our coming\nso late. Merciful heavens!”\n\nWhile she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle;\nDounia, too, put on her things. Her gloves, as Razumihin noticed, were\nnot merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty\ngave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in\npeople who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked reverently\nat Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. “The queen who mended her\nstockings in prison,” he thought, “must have looked then every inch a\nqueen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levées.”\n\n“My God!” exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “little did I think that I\nshould ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling Rodya! I am afraid,\nDmitri Prokofitch,” she added, glancing at him timidly.\n\n“Don’t be afraid, mother,” said Dounia, kissing her, “better have faith\nin him.”\n\n“Oh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven’t slept all night,”\n exclaimed the poor woman.\n\nThey came out into the street.\n\n“Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of\nMarfa Petrovna... she was all in white... she came up to me, took\nmy hand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly as though she were\nblaming me.... Is that a good omen? Oh, dear me! You don’t know, Dmitri\nProkofitch, that Marfa Petrovna’s dead!”\n\n“No, I didn’t know; who is Marfa Petrovna?”\n\n“She died suddenly; and only fancy...”\n\n“Afterwards, mamma,” put in Dounia. “He doesn’t know who Marfa Petrovna\nis.”\n\n“Ah, you don’t know? And I was thinking that you knew all about us.\nForgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I don’t know what I am thinking about\nthese last few days. I look upon you really as a providence for us, and\nso I took it for granted that you knew all about us. I look on you as a\nrelation.... Don’t be angry with me for saying so. Dear me, what’s the\nmatter with your right hand? Have you knocked it?”\n\n“Yes, I bruised it,” muttered Razumihin overjoyed.\n\n“I sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dounia finds fault\nwith me.... But, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in! I wonder whether\nhe is awake? Does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room? Listen,\nyou say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy\nhim with my... weaknesses? Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I to\ntreat him? I feel quite distracted, you know.”\n\n“Don’t question him too much about anything if you see him frown; don’t\nask him too much about his health; he doesn’t like that.”\n\n“Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother! But here are the\nstairs.... What an awful staircase!”\n\n“Mother, you are quite pale, don’t distress yourself, darling,” said\nDounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she added: “He ought to be\nhappy at seeing you, and you are tormenting yourself so.”\n\n“Wait, I’ll peep in and see whether he has waked up.”\n\nThe ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when they\nreached the landlady’s door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her\ndoor was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching\nthem from the darkness within. When their eyes met, the door was\nsuddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried\nout.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n“He is well, quite well!” Zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered.\n\nHe had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place\nas before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner,\nfully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for\nsome time past. The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed\nto follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.\n\nRaskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the\nday before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre. He looked like\na wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.\nHis brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spoke\nlittle and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a\nrestlessness in his movements.\n\nHe only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete\nthe impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. The\npale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister\nentered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in\nplace of its listless dejection. The light soon died away, but the look\nof suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patient\nwith all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed\nin him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of\nbitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable\ntorture. He saw later that almost every word of the following\nconversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. But\nat the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself\nand hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a\nmonomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.\n\n“Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well,” said Raskolnikov,\ngiving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna radiant at once. “And I don’t say this _as I did\nyesterday_,” he said, addressing Razumihin, with a friendly pressure of\nhis hand.\n\n“Yes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him to-day,” began Zossimov, much\ndelighted at the ladies’ entrance, for he had not succeeded in keeping\nup a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. “In another three or\nfour days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is,\nas he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. This has been\ncoming on for a long while.... eh? Confess, now, that it has been\nperhaps your own fault?” he added, with a tentative smile, as though\nstill afraid of irritating him.\n\n“It is very possible,” answered Raskolnikov coldly.\n\n“I should say, too,” continued Zossimov with zest, “that your complete\nrecovery depends solely on yourself. Now that one can talk to you,\nI should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the\nelementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your\nmorbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go\nfrom bad to worse. These fundamental causes I don’t know, but they must\nbe known to you. You are an intelligent man, and must have observed\nyourself, of course. I fancy the first stage of your derangement\ncoincides with your leaving the university. You must not be left without\noccupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, I\nfancy, be very beneficial.”\n\n“Yes, yes; you are perfectly right.... I will make haste and return to\nthe university: and then everything will go smoothly....”\n\nZossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before\nthe ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his\npatient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face. This lasted\nan instant, however. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking\nZossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.\n\n“What! he saw you last night?” Raskolnikov asked, as though startled.\n“Then you have not slept either after your journey.”\n\n“Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o’clock. Dounia and I never go to\nbed before two at home.”\n\n“I don’t know how to thank him either,” Raskolnikov went on,\nsuddenly frowning and looking down. “Setting aside the question of\npayment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)--I\nreally don’t know what I have done to deserve such special attention\nfrom you! I simply don’t understand it... and... and... it weighs upon\nme, indeed, because I don’t understand it. I tell you so candidly.”\n\n“Don’t be irritated.” Zossimov forced himself to laugh. “Assume that you\nare my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise love\nour first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in\nlove with them. And, of course, I am not rich in patients.”\n\n“I say nothing about him,” added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumihin,\n“though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble.”\n\n“What nonsense he is talking! Why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day,\nare you?” shouted Razumihin.\n\nIf he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no\ntrace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite.\nBut Avdotya Romanovna noticed it. She was intently and uneasily watching\nher brother.\n\n“As for you, mother, I don’t dare to speak,” he went on, as though\nrepeating a lesson learned by heart. “It is only to-day that I have\nbeen able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here\nyesterday, waiting for me to come back.”\n\nWhen he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister,\nsmiling without a word. But in this smile there was a flash of real\nunfeigned feeling. Dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his\nhand, overjoyed and thankful. It was the first time he had addressed her\nsince their dispute the previous day. The mother’s face lighted up\nwith ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken\nreconciliation. “Yes, that is what I love him for,” Razumihin,\nexaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in his\nchair. “He has these movements.”\n\n“And how well he does it all,” the mother was thinking to herself. “What\ngenerous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an end\nto all the misunderstanding with his sister--simply by holding out his\nhand at the right minute and looking at her like that.... And what\nfine eyes he has, and how fine his whole face is!... He is even better\nlooking than Dounia.... But, good heavens, what a suit--how terribly\nhe’s dressed!... Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch’s shop, is\nbetter dressed! I could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--but\nI am afraid.... Oh, dear, he’s so strange! He’s talking kindly, but I’m\nafraid! Why, what am I afraid of?...”\n\n“Oh, Rodya, you wouldn’t believe,” she began suddenly, in haste to\nanswer his words to her, “how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday! Now\nthat it’s all over and done with and we are quite happy again--I can\ntell you. Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace\nyou and that woman--ah, here she is! Good morning, Nastasya!... She told\nus at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away\nfrom the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the\nstreets. You can’t imagine how we felt! I couldn’t help thinking of the\ntragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father’s--you\ncan’t remember him, Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever\nand fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn’t pull him out\ntill next day. Of course, we exaggerated things. We were on the point of\nrushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we were\nalone, utterly alone,” she said plaintively and stopped short,\nsuddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr\nPetrovitch, although “we are quite happy again.”\n\n“Yes, yes.... Of course it’s very annoying....” Raskolnikov muttered in\nreply, but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazed\nat him in perplexity.\n\n“What else was it I wanted to say?” He went on trying to recollect. “Oh,\nyes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please don’t think that I didn’t mean\nto come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first.”\n\n“What are you saying, Rodya?” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. She, too,\nwas surprised.\n\n“Is he answering us as a duty?” Dounia wondered. “Is he being reconciled\nand asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating\na lesson?”\n\n“I’ve only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing\nto my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her... Nastasya... to wash out\nthe blood... I’ve only just dressed.”\n\n“Blood! What blood?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in alarm.\n\n“Oh, nothing--don’t be uneasy. It was when I was wandering about\nyesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a man who had been run\nover... a clerk...”\n\n“Delirious? But you remember everything!” Razumihin interrupted.\n\n“That’s true,” Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness. “I\nremember everything even to the slightest detail, and yet--why I did\nthat and went there and said that, I can’t clearly explain now.”\n\n“A familiar phenomenon,” interposed Zossimov, “actions are sometimes\nperformed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the\nactions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--it’s\nlike a dream.”\n\n“Perhaps it’s a good thing really that he should think me almost a\nmadman,” thought Raskolnikov.\n\n“Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too,” observed\nDounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov.\n\n“There is some truth in your observation,” the latter replied. “In that\nsense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the\nslight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we\nmust draw a line. A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Among\ndozens--perhaps hundreds of thousands--hardly one is to be met with.”\n\nAt the word “madman,” carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter on\nhis favourite subject, everyone frowned.\n\nRaskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a\nstrange smile on his pale lips. He was still meditating on something.\n\n“Well, what about the man who was run over? I interrupted you!”\n Razumihin cried hastily.\n\n“What?” Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. “Oh... I got spattered with\nblood helping to carry him to his lodging. By the way, mamma, I did an\nunpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gave\naway all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral. She’s\na widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children,\nstarving... nothing in the house... there’s a daughter, too... perhaps\nyou’d have given it yourself if you’d seen them. But I had no right to\ndo it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.\nTo help others one must have the right to do it, or else _Crevez,\nchiens, si vous n’êtes pas contents_.” He laughed, “That’s right, isn’t\nit, Dounia?”\n\n“No, it’s not,” answered Dounia firmly.\n\n“Bah! you, too, have ideals,” he muttered, looking at her almost with\nhatred, and smiling sarcastically. “I ought to have considered that....\nWell, that’s praiseworthy, and it’s better for you... and if you reach a\nline you won’t overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it,\nmaybe you will be still unhappier.... But all that’s nonsense,” he added\nirritably, vexed at being carried away. “I only meant to say that I beg\nyour forgiveness, mother,” he concluded, shortly and abruptly.\n\n“That’s enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do is very good,”\n said his mother, delighted.\n\n“Don’t be too sure,” he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile.\n\nA silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all this\nconversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the\nforgiveness, and all were feeling it.\n\n“It is as though they were afraid of me,” Raskolnikov was thinking\nto himself, looking askance at his mother and sister. Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent.\n\n“Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much,” flashed through\nhis mind.\n\n“Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\nsuddenly blurted out.\n\n“What Marfa Petrovna?”\n\n“Oh, mercy on us--Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov. I wrote you so much about\nher.”\n\n“A-a-h! Yes, I remember.... So she’s dead! Oh, really?” he roused\nhimself suddenly, as if waking up. “What did she die of?”\n\n“Only imagine, quite suddenly,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered\nhurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. “On the very day I was sending\nyou that letter! Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been\nthe cause of her death. They say he beat her dreadfully.”\n\n“Why, were they on such bad terms?” he asked, addressing his sister.\n\n“Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was always very\npatient, considerate even. In fact, all those seven years of their\nmarried life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases. All\nof a sudden he seems to have lost patience.”\n\n“Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven\nyears? You seem to be defending him, Dounia?”\n\n“No, no, he’s an awful man! I can imagine nothing more awful!” Dounia\nanswered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking into\nthought.\n\n“That had happened in the morning,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on\nhurriedly. “And directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be\nharnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner. She always used\nto drive to the town in such cases. She ate a very good dinner, I am\ntold....”\n\n“After the beating?”\n\n“That was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not\nto be late in starting, she went to the bath-house.... You see, she was\nundergoing some treatment with baths. They have a cold spring there, and\nshe used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got\ninto the water when she suddenly had a stroke!”\n\n“I should think so,” said Zossimov.\n\n“And did he beat her badly?”\n\n“What does that matter!” put in Dounia.\n\n“H’m! But I don’t know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother,”\n said Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself.\n\n“Ah, my dear, I don’t know what to talk about,” broke from Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna.\n\n“Why, are you all afraid of me?” he asked, with a constrained smile.\n\n“That’s certainly true,” said Dounia, looking directly and sternly at\nher brother. “Mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the\nstairs.”\n\nHis face worked, as though in convulsion.\n\n“Ach, what are you saying, Dounia! Don’t be angry, please, Rodya....\nWhy did you say that, Dounia?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began,\noverwhelmed--“You see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in the\ntrain, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything\ntogether.... And I was so happy, I did not notice the journey! But what\nam I saying? I am happy now.... You should not, Dounia.... I am happy\nnow--simply in seeing you, Rodya....”\n\n“Hush, mother,” he muttered in confusion, not looking at her, but\npressing her hand. “We shall have time to speak freely of everything!”\n\nAs he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned\npale. Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly\nchill over his soul. Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to\nhim that he had just told a fearful lie--that he would never now be\nable to speak freely of everything--that he would never again be able to\n_speak_ of anything to anyone. The anguish of this thought was such that\nfor a moment he almost forgot himself. He got up from his seat, and not\nlooking at anyone walked towards the door.\n\n“What are you about?” cried Razumihin, clutching him by the arm.\n\nHe sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence. They were\nall looking at him in perplexity.\n\n“But what are you all so dull for?” he shouted, suddenly and quite\nunexpectedly. “Do say something! What’s the use of sitting like this?\nCome, do speak. Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....\nCome, anything!”\n\n“Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning\nagain,” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself.\n\n“What is the matter, Rodya?” asked Avdotya Romanovna, distrustfully.\n\n“Oh, nothing! I remembered something,” he answered, and suddenly\nlaughed.\n\n“Well, if you remembered something; that’s all right!... I was beginning\nto think...” muttered Zossimov, getting up from the sofa. “It is time\nfor me to be off. I will look in again perhaps... if I can...” He made\nhis bows, and went out.\n\n“What an excellent man!” observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\n\n“Yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent,” Raskolnikov\nbegan, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he\nhad not shown till then. “I can’t remember where I met him before my\nillness.... I believe I have met him somewhere----... And this is a good\nman, too,” he nodded at Razumihin. “Do you like him, Dounia?” he asked\nher; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.\n\n“Very much,” answered Dounia.\n\n“Foo!--what a pig you are!” Razumihin protested, blushing in terrible\nconfusion, and he got up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled\nfaintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.\n\n“Where are you off to?”\n\n“I must go.”\n\n“You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you must. Don’t go.\nWhat’s the time? Is it twelve o’clock? What a pretty watch you have got,\nDounia. But why are you all silent again? I do all the talking.”\n\n“It was a present from Marfa Petrovna,” answered Dounia.\n\n“And a very expensive one!” added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\n\n“A-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a lady’s.”\n\n“I like that sort,” said Dounia.\n\n“So it is not a present from her _fiancé_,” thought Razumihin, and was\nunreasonably delighted.\n\n“I thought it was Luzhin’s present,” observed Raskolnikov.\n\n“No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet.”\n\n“A-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get\nmarried?” he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted\nby the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.\n\n“Oh, yes, my dear.”\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.\n\n“H’m, yes. What shall I tell you? I don’t remember much indeed. She was\nsuch a sickly girl,” he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again.\n“Quite an invalid. She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was\nalways dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she\nbegan talking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember very\nwell. She was an ugly little thing. I really don’t know what drew me\nto her then--I think it was because she was always ill. If she had been\nlame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still,” he\nsmiled dreamily. “Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium.”\n\n“No, it was not only spring delirium,” said Dounia, with warm feeling.\n\nHe fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did\nnot understand her words. Then, completely lost in thought, he got up,\nwent up to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down.\n\n“You love her even now?” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, touched.\n\n“Her? Now? Oh, yes.... You ask about her? No... that’s all now, as\nit were, in another world... and so long ago. And indeed everything\nhappening here seems somehow far away.” He looked attentively at them.\n“You, now... I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...\nbut, goodness knows why we are talking of that! And what’s the use of\nasking about it?” he added with annoyance, and biting his nails, fell\ninto dreamy silence again.\n\n“What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It’s like a tomb,” said\nPulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. “I\nam sure it’s quite half through your lodging you have become so\nmelancholy.”\n\n“My lodging,” he answered, listlessly. “Yes, the lodging had a great\ndeal to do with it.... I thought that, too.... If only you knew, though,\nwhat a strange thing you said just now, mother,” he said, laughing\nstrangely.\n\nA little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister,\nwith him after three years’ absence, this intimate tone of conversation,\nin face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything,\nwould have been beyond his power of endurance. But there was one urgent\nmatter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he had\ndecided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it, as a means of\nescape.\n\n“Listen, Dounia,” he began, gravely and drily, “of course I beg your\npardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again that\nI do not withdraw from my chief point. It is me or Luzhin. If I am a\nscoundrel, you must not be. One is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease\nat once to look on you as a sister.”\n\n“Rodya, Rodya! It is the same as yesterday again,” Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna cried, mournfully. “And why do you call yourself a\nscoundrel? I can’t bear it. You said the same yesterday.”\n\n“Brother,” Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness. “In all\nthis there is a mistake on your part. I thought it over at night,\nand found out the mistake. It is all because you seem to fancy I am\nsacrificing myself to someone and for someone. That is not the case at\nall. I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for\nme. Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to\nmy family. But that is not the chief motive for my decision....”\n\n“She is lying,” he thought to himself, biting his nails vindictively.\n“Proud creature! She won’t admit she wants to do it out of charity! Too\nhaughty! Oh, base characters! They even love as though they hate.... Oh,\nhow I... hate them all!”\n\n“In fact,” continued Dounia, “I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of\ntwo evils I choose the less. I intend to do honestly all he expects of\nme, so I am not deceiving him.... Why did you smile just now?” She, too,\nflushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes.\n\n“All?” he asked, with a malignant grin.\n\n“Within certain limits. Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch’s\ncourtship showed me at once what he wanted. He may, of course, think too\nwell of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too.... Why are you laughing\nagain?”\n\n“And why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You are\nintentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your\nown against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him and talked\nwith him. So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you\nare acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it.”\n\n“It is not true. I am not lying,” cried Dounia, losing her composure.\n“I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me\nand thinks highly of me. I would not marry him if I were not firmly\nconvinced that I can respect him. Fortunately, I can have convincing\nproof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, as\nyou say! And even if you were right, if I really had determined on a\nvile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?\nWhy do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either? It\nis despotism; it is tyranny. If I ruin anyone, it is only myself.... I\nam not committing a murder. Why do you look at me like that? Why are you\nso pale? Rodya, darling, what’s the matter?”\n\n“Good heavens! You have made him faint,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\n\n“No, no, nonsense! It’s nothing. A little giddiness--not fainting. You\nhave fainting on the brain. H’m, yes, what was I saying? Oh, yes. In\nwhat way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him,\nand that he... esteems you, as you said. I think you said to-day?”\n\n“Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch’s letter,” said Dounia.\n\nWith trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter. He\ntook it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked\nwith a sort of wonder at Dounia.\n\n“It is strange,” he said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea. “What\nam I making such a fuss for? What is it all about? Marry whom you like!”\n\nHe said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for\nsome time at his sister, as though puzzled. He opened the letter at\nlast, still with the same look of strange wonder on his face. Then,\nslowly and attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice.\nPulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected\nsomething particular.\n\n“What surprises me,” he began, after a short pause, handing the letter\nto his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, “is that he is a\nbusiness man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and\nyet he writes such an uneducated letter.”\n\nThey all started. They had expected something quite different.\n\n“But they all write like that, you know,” Razumihin observed, abruptly.\n\n“Have you read it?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“We showed him, Rodya. We... consulted him just now,” Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna began, embarrassed.\n\n“That’s just the jargon of the courts,” Razumihin put in. “Legal\ndocuments are written like that to this day.”\n\n“Legal? Yes, it’s just legal--business language--not so very uneducated,\nand not quite educated--business language!”\n\n“Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap\neducation, he is proud indeed of having made his own way,” Avdotya\nRomanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother’s tone.\n\n“Well, if he’s proud of it, he has reason, I don’t deny it. You seem to\nbe offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the\nletter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to\nannoy you. It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style\noccurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There\nis one expression, ‘blame yourselves’ put in very significantly and\nplainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I\nam present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon\nyou both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning\nyou to Petersburg. Well, what do you think? Can one resent such an\nexpression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had\nwritten it, or Zossimov, or one of us?”\n\n“N-no,” answered Dounia, with more animation. “I saw clearly that it\nwas too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill\nin writing... that is a true criticism, brother. I did not expect,\nindeed...”\n\n“It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he\nintended. But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expression\nin the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one. I\ngave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed\nwith trouble, and not ‘on the pretext of the funeral,’ but simply to pay\nfor the funeral, and not to the daughter--a young woman, as he writes,\nof notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my\nlife)--but to the widow. In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander\nme and to raise dissension between us. It is expressed again in legal\njargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and\nwith a very naïve eagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to act\nsensibly, intelligence is not enough. It all shows the man and... I\ndon’t think he has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply to\nwarn you, because I sincerely wish for your good...”\n\nDounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She was only\nawaiting the evening.\n\n“Then what is your decision, Rodya?” asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who\nwas more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his\ntalk.\n\n“What decision?”\n\n“You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this\nevening, and that he will go away if you come. So will you... come?”\n\n“That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are\nnot offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, is\nnot offended. I will do what you think best,” he added, drily.\n\n“Dounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her,” Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna hastened to declare.\n\n“I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at\nthis interview,” said Dounia. “Will you come?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o’clock,” she said,\naddressing Razumihin. “Mother, I am inviting him, too.”\n\n“Quite right, Dounia. Well, since you have decided,” added Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna, “so be it. I shall feel easier myself. I do not like\nconcealment and deception. Better let us have the whole truth.... Pyotr\nPetrovitch may be angry or not, now!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nAt that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into\nthe room, looking timidly about her. Everyone turned towards her with\nsurprise and curiosity. At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise\nher. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday for\nthe first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such\na dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her. Now she\nwas a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed,\nalmost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but\nsomewhat frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain indoor\ndress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried a\nparasol. Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so\nmuch embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a\nlittle child. She was even about to retreat. “Oh... it’s you!” said\nRaskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused. He at once\nrecollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhin’s letter\nof “some young woman of notorious behaviour.” He had only just been\nprotesting against Luzhin’s calumny and declaring that he had seen the\ngirl last night for the first time, and suddenly she had walked in. He\nremembered, too, that he had not protested against the expression “of\nnotorious behaviour.” All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through\nhis brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliated\ncreature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her. When she\nmade a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart.\n\n“I did not expect you,” he said, hurriedly, with a look that made her\nstop. “Please sit down. You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna.\nAllow me--not there. Sit here....”\n\nAt Sonia’s entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of\nRaskolnikov’s three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to\nenter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where\nZossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him\nas a bed, was too _familiar_ a place, he hurriedly motioned her to\nRazumihin’s chair.\n\n“You sit here,” he said to Razumihin, putting him on the sofa.\n\nSonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the\ntwo ladies. It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she\ncould sit down beside them. At the thought of it, she was so frightened\nthat she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed\nRaskolnikov.\n\n“I... I... have come for one minute. Forgive me for disturbing you,” she\nbegan falteringly. “I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one to\nsend. Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in\nthe morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her...\nto do her the honour... she told me to beg you...” Sonia stammered and\nceased speaking.\n\n“I will try, certainly, most certainly,” answered Raskolnikov. He,\ntoo, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence.\n“Please sit down,” he said, suddenly. “I want to talk to you. You are\nperhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes,” and\nhe drew up a chair for her.\n\nSonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened\nlook at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. Raskolnikov’s pale face\nflushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed.\n\n“Mother,” he said, firmly and insistently, “this is Sofya Semyonovna\nMarmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run\nover yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you.”\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed up\nher eyes. In spite of her embarrassment before Rodya’s urgent and\nchallenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction. Dounia\ngazed gravely and intently into the poor girl’s face, and scrutinised\nher with perplexity. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise\nher eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever.\n\n“I wanted to ask you,” said Raskolnikov, hastily, “how things were\narranged yesterday. You were not worried by the police, for instance?”\n\n“No, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death...\nthey did not worry us... only the lodgers are angry.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“At the body’s remaining so long. You see it is hot now. So that,\nto-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until\nto-morrow. At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she sees\nherself that it’s necessary...”\n\n“To-day, then?”\n\n“She begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the\nservice, and then to be present at the funeral lunch.”\n\n“She is giving a funeral lunch?”\n\n“Yes... just a little.... She told me to thank you very much for helping\nus yesterday. But for you, we should have had nothing for the funeral.”\n\nAll at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, she\ncontrolled herself, looking down again.\n\nDuring the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her carefully. She had a\nthin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a\nsharp little nose and chin. She could not have been called pretty, but\nher blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such\na kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help\nbeing attracted. Her face, and her whole figure indeed, had another\npeculiar characteristic. In spite of her eighteen years, she looked\nalmost a little girl--almost a child. And in some of her gestures, this\nchildishness seemed almost absurd.\n\n“But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?\nDoes she even mean to have a funeral lunch?” Raskolnikov asked,\npersistently keeping up the conversation.\n\n“The coffin will be plain, of course... and everything will be plain, so\nit won’t cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out, so\nthat there will be enough left... and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious\nit should be so. You know one can’t... it’s a comfort to her... she is\nlike that, you know....”\n\n“I understand, I understand... of course... why do you look at my room\nlike that? My mother has just said it is like a tomb.”\n\n“You gave us everything yesterday,” Sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a\nloud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion. Her lips\nand chin were trembling once more. She had been struck at once\nby Raskolnikov’s poor surroundings, and now these words broke out\nspontaneously. A silence followed. There was a light in Dounia’s eyes,\nand even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.\n\n“Rodya,” she said, getting up, “we shall have dinner together, of\ncourse. Come, Dounia.... And you, Rodya, had better go for a little\nwalk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us.... I am\nafraid we have exhausted you....”\n\n“Yes, yes, I’ll come,” he answered, getting up fussily. “But I have\nsomething to see to.”\n\n“But surely you will have dinner together?” cried Razumihin, looking in\nsurprise at Raskolnikov. “What do you mean?”\n\n“Yes, yes, I am coming... of course, of course! And you stay a minute.\nYou do not want him just now, do you, mother? Or perhaps I am taking him\nfrom you?”\n\n“Oh, no, no. And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining\nwith us?”\n\n“Please do,” added Dounia.\n\nRazumihin bowed, positively radiant. For one moment, they were all\nstrangely embarrassed.\n\n“Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet. I do not like saying good-bye.\nGood-bye, Nastasya. Ah, I have said good-bye again.”\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failed\nto come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room.\n\nBut Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother\nout, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow. Sonia, in confusion, gave\na hurried, frightened curtsy. There was a look of poignant discomfort\nin her face, as though Avdotya Romanovna’s courtesy and attention were\noppressive and painful to her.\n\n“Dounia, good-bye,” called Raskolnikov, in the passage. “Give me your\nhand.”\n\n“Why, I did give it to you. Have you forgotten?” said Dounia, turning\nwarmly and awkwardly to him.\n\n“Never mind, give it to me again.” And he squeezed her fingers warmly.\n\nDounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went off quite happy.\n\n“Come, that’s capital,” he said to Sonia, going back and looking\nbrightly at her. “God give peace to the dead, the living have still to\nlive. That is right, isn’t it?”\n\nSonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face. He looked\nat her for some moments in silence. The whole history of the dead father\nfloated before his memory in those moments....\n\n*****\n\n“Heavens, Dounia,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, as soon as they were in\nthe street, “I really feel relieved myself at coming away--more at ease.\nHow little did I think yesterday in the train that I could ever be glad\nof that.”\n\n“I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. Don’t you see it?\nPerhaps worrying about us upset him. We must be patient, and much, much\ncan be forgiven.”\n\n“Well, you were not very patient!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her up,\nhotly and jealously. “Do you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two. You\nare the very portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul. You\nare both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and both\ngenerous.... Surely he can’t be an egoist, Dounia. Eh? When I think of\nwhat is in store for us this evening, my heart sinks!”\n\n“Don’t be uneasy, mother. What must be, will be.”\n\n“Dounia, only think what a position we are in! What if Pyotr Petrovitch\nbreaks it off?” poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna blurted out, incautiously.\n\n“He won’t be worth much if he does,” answered Dounia, sharply and\ncontemptuously.\n\n“We did well to come away,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly broke in.\n“He was in a hurry about some business or other. If he gets out and has\na breath of air... it is fearfully close in his room.... But where is\none to get a breath of air here? The very streets here feel like shut-up\nrooms. Good heavens! what a town!... stay... this side... they will\ncrush you--carrying something. Why, it is a piano they have got, I\ndeclare... how they push!... I am very much afraid of that young woman,\ntoo.”\n\n“What young woman, mother?\n\n“Why, that Sofya Semyonovna, who was there just now.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“I have a presentiment, Dounia. Well, you may believe it or not, but\nas soon as she came in, that very minute, I felt that she was the chief\ncause of the trouble....”\n\n“Nothing of the sort!” cried Dounia, in vexation. “What nonsense, with\nyour presentiments, mother! He only made her acquaintance the evening\nbefore, and he did not know her when she came in.”\n\n“Well, you will see.... She worries me; but you will see, you will\nsee! I was so frightened. She was gazing at me with those eyes. I could\nscarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her, do you\nremember? It seems so strange, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that\nabout her, and he introduces her to us--to you! So he must think a great\ndeal of her.”\n\n“People will write anything. We were talked about and written about,\ntoo. Have you forgotten? I am sure that she is a good girl, and that it\nis all nonsense.”\n\n“God grant it may be!”\n\n“And Pyotr Petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer,” Dounia snapped out,\nsuddenly.\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was crushed; the conversation was not resumed.\n\n*****\n\n“I will tell you what I want with you,” said Raskolnikov, drawing\nRazumihin to the window.\n\n“Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that you are coming,” Sonia said\nhurriedly, preparing to depart.\n\n“One minute, Sofya Semyonovna. We have no secrets. You are not in our\nway. I want to have another word or two with you. Listen!” he turned\nsuddenly to Razumihin again. “You know that... what’s his name...\nPorfiry Petrovitch?”\n\n“I should think so! He is a relation. Why?” added the latter, with\ninterest.\n\n“Is not he managing that case... you know, about that murder?... You\nwere speaking about it yesterday.”\n\n“Yes... well?” Razumihin’s eyes opened wide.\n\n“He was inquiring for people who had pawned things, and I have some\npledges there, too--trifles--a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when\nI left home, and my father’s silver watch--they are only worth five or\nsix roubles altogether... but I value them. So what am I to do now? I\ndo not want to lose the things, especially the watch. I was quaking just\nnow, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of Dounia’s\nwatch. It is the only thing of father’s left us. She would be ill if\nit were lost. You know what women are. So tell me what to do. I know I\nought to have given notice at the police station, but would it not be\nbetter to go straight to Porfiry? Eh? What do you think? The matter\nmight be settled more quickly. You see, mother may ask for it before\ndinner.”\n\n“Certainly not to the police station. Certainly to Porfiry,” Razumihin\nshouted in extraordinary excitement. “Well, how glad I am. Let us go at\nonce. It is a couple of steps. We shall be sure to find him.”\n\n“Very well, let us go.”\n\n“And he will be very, very glad to make your acquaintance. I have\noften talked to him of you at different times. I was speaking of you\nyesterday. Let us go. So you knew the old woman? So that’s it! It is all\nturning out splendidly.... Oh, yes, Sofya Ivanovna...”\n\n“Sofya Semyonovna,” corrected Raskolnikov. “Sofya Semyonovna, this is my\nfriend Razumihin, and he is a good man.”\n\n“If you have to go now,” Sonia was beginning, not looking at Razumihin\nat all, and still more embarrassed.\n\n“Let us go,” decided Raskolnikov. “I will come to you to-day, Sofya\nSemyonovna. Only tell me where you live.”\n\nHe was not exactly ill at ease, but seemed hurried, and avoided her\neyes. Sonia gave her address, and flushed as she did so. They all went\nout together.\n\n“Don’t you lock up?” asked Razumihin, following him on to the stairs.\n\n“Never,” answered Raskolnikov. “I have been meaning to buy a lock for\nthese two years. People are happy who have no need of locks,” he said,\nlaughing, to Sonia. They stood still in the gateway.\n\n“Do you go to the right, Sofya Semyonovna? How did you find me, by the\nway?” he added, as though he wanted to say something quite different. He\nwanted to look at her soft clear eyes, but this was not easy.\n\n“Why, you gave your address to Polenka yesterday.”\n\n“Polenka? Oh, yes; Polenka, that is the little girl. She is your sister?\nDid I give her the address?”\n\n“Why, had you forgotten?”\n\n“No, I remember.”\n\n“I had heard my father speak of you... only I did not know your name,\nand he did not know it. And now I came... and as I had learnt your name,\nI asked to-day, ‘Where does Mr. Raskolnikov live?’ I did not know you\nhad only a room too.... Good-bye, I will tell Katerina Ivanovna.”\n\nShe was extremely glad to escape at last; she went away looking down,\nhurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible, to walk the twenty\nsteps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone, and then\nmoving rapidly along, looking at no one, noticing nothing, to think, to\nremember, to meditate on every word, every detail. Never, never had she\nfelt anything like this. Dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was\nopening before her. She remembered suddenly that Raskolnikov meant to\ncome to her that day, perhaps at once!\n\n“Only not to-day, please, not to-day!” she kept muttering with a sinking\nheart, as though entreating someone, like a frightened child. “Mercy! to\nme... to that room... he will see... oh, dear!”\n\nShe was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who\nwas watching her and following at her heels. He had accompanied her from\nthe gateway. At the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stood\nstill at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing,\nstarted on hearing Sonia’s words: “and I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov\nlived?” He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especially\nupon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted\nthe house. All this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying not\nto betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though waiting for\nsomething. He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting, and\nthat Sonia was going home.\n\n“Home? Where? I’ve seen that face somewhere,” he thought. “I must find\nout.”\n\nAt the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming the\nsame way, noticing nothing. She turned the corner. He followed her on\nthe other side. After about fifty paces he crossed over again, overtook\nher and kept two or three yards behind her.\n\nHe was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad high\nshoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little. He wore\ngood and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position.\nHe carried a handsome cane, which he tapped on the pavement at each\nstep; his gloves were spotless. He had a broad, rather pleasant face\nwith high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg.\nHis flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there with\ngrey, and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair.\nHis eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were\ncrimson. He was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger\nthan his years.\n\nWhen Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on\nthe pavement. He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation. On reaching\nthe house where she lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed\nher, seeming rather surprised. In the courtyard she turned to the right\ncorner. “Bah!” muttered the unknown gentleman, and mounted the stairs\nbehind her. Only then Sonia noticed him. She reached the third storey,\nturned down the passage, and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribed\nin chalk, “Kapernaumov, Tailor.” “Bah!” the stranger repeated again,\nwondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next door, at No. 8.\nThe doors were two or three yards apart.\n\n“You lodge at Kapernaumov’s,” he said, looking at Sonia and laughing.\n“He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am staying close here at\nMadame Resslich’s. How odd!” Sonia looked at him attentively.\n\n“We are neighbours,” he went on gaily. “I only came to town the day\nbefore yesterday. Good-bye for the present.”\n\nSonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in. She felt for\nsome reason ashamed and uneasy.\n\n*****\n\nOn the way to Porfiry’s, Razumihin was obviously excited.\n\n“That’s capital, brother,” he repeated several times, “and I am glad! I\nam glad!”\n\n“What are you glad about?” Raskolnikov thought to himself.\n\n“I didn’t know that you pledged things at the old woman’s, too. And...\nwas it long ago? I mean, was it long since you were there?”\n\n“What a simple-hearted fool he is!”\n\n“When was it?” Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect. “Two or three\ndays before her death it must have been. But I am not going to redeem\nthe things now,” he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous\nsolicitude about the things. “I’ve not more than a silver rouble\nleft... after last night’s accursed delirium!”\n\nHe laid special emphasis on the delirium.\n\n“Yes, yes,” Razumihin hastened to agree--with what was not clear. “Then\nthat’s why you... were stuck... partly... you know in your delirium you\nwere continually mentioning some rings or chains! Yes, yes... that’s\nclear, it’s all clear now.”\n\n“Hullo! How that idea must have got about among them. Here this man will\ngo to the stake for me, and I find him delighted at having it _cleared\nup_ why I spoke of rings in my delirium! What a hold the idea must have\non all of them!”\n\n“Shall we find him?” he asked suddenly.\n\n“Oh, yes,” Razumihin answered quickly. “He is a nice fellow, you will\nsee, brother. Rather clumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polished\nmanners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense. He is an intelligent\nfellow, very much so indeed, but he has his own range of ideas.... He\nis incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he likes to impose on people, or\nrather to make fun of them. His is the old, circumstantial method....\nBut he understands his work... thoroughly.... Last year he cleared up a\ncase of murder in which the police had hardly a clue. He is very, very\nanxious to make your acquaintance!”\n\n“On what grounds is he so anxious?”\n\n“Oh, it’s not exactly... you see, since you’ve been ill I happen to have\nmentioned you several times.... So, when he heard about you... about\nyour being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he said,\n‘What a pity!’ And so I concluded... from everything together, not only\nthat; yesterday Zametov... you know, Rodya, I talked some nonsense on\nthe way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk... I am afraid, brother,\nof your exaggerating it, you see.”\n\n“What? That they think I am a madman? Maybe they are right,” he said\nwith a constrained smile.\n\n“Yes, yes.... That is, pooh, no!... But all that I said (and there was\nsomething else too) it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense.”\n\n“But why are you apologising? I am so sick of it all!” Raskolnikov cried\nwith exaggerated irritability. It was partly assumed, however.\n\n“I know, I know, I understand. Believe me, I understand. One’s ashamed\nto speak of it.”\n\n“If you are ashamed, then don’t speak of it.”\n\nBoth were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic and Raskolnikov\nperceived it with repulsion. He was alarmed, too, by what Razumihin had\njust said about Porfiry.\n\n“I shall have to pull a long face with him too,” he thought, with a\nbeating heart, and he turned white, “and do it naturally, too. But the\nmost natural thing would be to do nothing at all. Carefully do nothing\nat all! No, _carefully_ would not be natural again.... Oh, well, we\nshall see how it turns out.... We shall see... directly. Is it a good\nthing to go or not? The butterfly flies to the light. My heart is\nbeating, that’s what’s bad!”\n\n“In this grey house,” said Razumihin.\n\n“The most important thing, does Porfiry know that I was at the old\nhag’s flat yesterday... and asked about the blood? I must find that out\ninstantly, as soon as I go in, find out from his face; otherwise... I’ll\nfind out, if it’s my ruin.”\n\n“I say, brother,” he said suddenly, addressing Razumihin, with a sly\nsmile, “I have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously\nexcited. Isn’t it so?”\n\n“Excited? Not a bit of it,” said Razumihin, stung to the quick.\n\n“Yes, brother, I assure you it’s noticeable. Why, you sat on your chair\nin a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be\nwrithing all the time. You kept jumping up for nothing. One moment you\nwere angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even\nblushed; especially when you were invited to dinner, you blushed\nawfully.”\n\n“Nothing of the sort, nonsense! What do you mean?”\n\n“But why are you wriggling out of it, like a schoolboy? By Jove, there\nhe’s blushing again.”\n\n“What a pig you are!”\n\n“But why are you so shamefaced about it? Romeo! Stay, I’ll tell of you\nto-day. Ha-ha-ha! I’ll make mother laugh, and someone else, too...”\n\n“Listen, listen, listen, this is serious.... What next, you fiend!”\n Razumihin was utterly overwhelmed, turning cold with horror. “What will\nyou tell them? Come, brother... foo! what a pig you are!”\n\n“You are like a summer rose. And if only you knew how it suits you; a\nRomeo over six foot high! And how you’ve washed to-day--you cleaned your\nnails, I declare. Eh? That’s something unheard of! Why, I do believe\nyou’ve got pomatum on your hair! Bend down.”\n\n“Pig!”\n\nRaskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself. So\nlaughing, they entered Porfiry Petrovitch’s flat. This is what\nRaskolnikov wanted: from within they could be heard laughing as they\ncame in, still guffawing in the passage.\n\n“Not a word here or I’ll... brain you!” Razumihin whispered furiously,\nseizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nRaskolnikov was already entering the room. He came in looking as though\nhe had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again. Behind him\nRazumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony,\nwith an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face and\nwhole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified\nRaskolnikov’s laughter. Raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction,\nbowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room\nlooking inquiringly at them. He held out his hand and shook hands, still\napparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few\nwords to introduce himself. But he had no sooner succeeded in assuming\na serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as\nthough accidentally at Razumihin, and could no longer control himself:\nhis stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried\nto restrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received\nthis “spontaneous” mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most\ngenuine fun and naturalness. Razumihin strengthened this impression as\nthough on purpose.\n\n“Fool! You fiend,” he roared, waving his arm which at once struck a\nlittle round table with an empty tea-glass on it. Everything was sent\nflying and crashing.\n\n“But why break chairs, gentlemen? You know it’s a loss to the Crown,”\n Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.\n\nRaskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry Petrovitch’s,\nbut anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right moment to put a natural\nend to it. Razumihin, completely put to confusion by upsetting the table\nand smashing the glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and\nturned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back\nto the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing.\nPorfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, but\nobviously looked for explanations. Zametov had been sitting in the\ncorner, but he rose at the visitors’ entrance and was standing in\nexpectation with a smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and\neven it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a\ncertain embarrassment. Zametov’s unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov\nunpleasantly.\n\n“I’ve got to think of that,” he thought. “Excuse me, please,” he began,\naffecting extreme embarrassment. “Raskolnikov.”\n\n“Not at all, very pleasant to see you... and how pleasantly you’ve come\nin.... Why, won’t he even say good-morning?” Porfiry Petrovitch nodded\nat Razumihin.\n\n“Upon my honour I don’t know why he is in such a rage with me. I only\ntold him as we came along that he was like Romeo... and proved it. And\nthat was all, I think!”\n\n“Pig!” ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round.\n\n“There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is so furious at\nthe word,” Porfiry laughed.\n\n“Oh, you sharp lawyer!... Damn you all!” snapped Razumihin, and suddenly\nbursting out laughing himself, he went up to Porfiry with a more\ncheerful face as though nothing had happened. “That’ll do! We are\nall fools. To come to business. This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch\nRaskolnikov; in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make\nyour acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of business with\nyou. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? Have you met before? Have you\nknown each other long?”\n\n“What does this mean?” thought Raskolnikov uneasily.\n\nZametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.\n\n“Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,” he said easily.\n\n“Then I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was begging me\nto introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out\nwithout me. Where is your tobacco?”\n\nPorfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and\ntrodden-down slippers. He was a man of about five and thirty, short,\nstout even to corpulence, and clean shaven. He wore his hair cut short\nand had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back. His\nsoft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour,\nbut had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It would have been\ngood-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery,\nmawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes. The expression\nof those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish\nfigure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at\nfirst sight.\n\nAs soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter\nof business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down\nhimself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with\nthat careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and\nembarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are\ndiscussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such\nexceptional solemnity. But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov\nexplained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied\nwith himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry.\nPorfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin,\nsitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently,\nlooking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive\ninterest.\n\n“Fool,” Raskolnikov swore to himself.\n\n“You have to give information to the police,” Porfiry replied, with a\nmost businesslike air, “that having learnt of this incident, that is of\nthe murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such\nand such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them...\nor... but they will write to you.”\n\n“That’s just the point, that at the present moment,” Raskolnikov tried\nhis utmost to feign embarrassment, “I am not quite in funds... and\neven this trifling sum is beyond me... I only wanted, you see, for\nthe present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I have\nmoney....”\n\n“That’s no matter,” answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving his\nexplanation of his pecuniary position coldly, “but you can, if you\nprefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the\nmatter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg...”\n\n“On an ordinary sheet of paper?” Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again\ninterested in the financial side of the question.\n\n“Oh, the most ordinary,” and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with\nobvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at\nhim. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov’s fancy, for it all lasted but a\nmoment. There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov could\nhave sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why.\n\n“He knows,” flashed through his mind like lightning.\n\n“Forgive my troubling you about such trifles,” he went on, a little\ndisconcerted, “the things are only worth five roubles, but I prize them\nparticularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I must\nconfess that I was alarmed when I heard...”\n\n“That’s why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that\nPorfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!” Razumihin put in\nwith obvious intention.\n\nThis was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him\nwith a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately\nrecollected himself.\n\n“You seem to be jeering at me, brother?” he said to him, with a\nwell-feigned irritability. “I dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious\nabout such trash; but you mustn’t think me selfish or grasping for that,\nand these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes. I told you\njust now that the silver watch, though it’s not worth a cent, is the\nonly thing left us of my father’s. You may laugh at me, but my mother is\nhere,” he turned suddenly to Porfiry, “and if she knew,” he turned again\nhurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, “that the\nwatch was lost, she would be in despair! You know what women are!”\n\n“Not a bit of it! I didn’t mean that at all! Quite the contrary!”\n shouted Razumihin distressed.\n\n“Was it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it?” Raskolnikov asked\nhimself in a tremor. “Why did I say that about women?”\n\n“Oh, your mother is with you?” Porfiry Petrovitch inquired.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“When did she come?”\n\n“Last night.”\n\nPorfiry paused as though reflecting.\n\n“Your things would not in any case be lost,” he went on calmly and\ncoldly. “I have been expecting you here for some time.”\n\nAnd as though that was a matter of no importance, he carefully offered\nthe ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash\nover the carpet. Raskolnikov shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be\nlooking at him, and was still concerned with Razumihin’s cigarette.\n\n“What? Expecting him? Why, did you know that he had pledges _there_?”\n cried Razumihin.\n\nPorfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.\n\n“Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and on\nthe paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with the\ndate on which you left them with her...”\n\n“How observant you are!” Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, doing his very\nutmost to look him straight in the face, but he failed, and suddenly\nadded:\n\n“I say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges... that it\nmust be difficult to remember them all.... But you remember them all so\nclearly, and... and...”\n\n“Stupid! Feeble!” he thought. “Why did I add that?”\n\n“But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasn’t\ncome forward,” Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony.\n\n“I haven’t been quite well.”\n\n“I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great distress\nabout something. You look pale still.”\n\n“I am not pale at all.... No, I am quite well,” Raskolnikov snapped\nout rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone. His anger was\nmounting, he could not repress it. “And in my anger I shall betray\nmyself,” flashed through his mind again. “Why are they torturing me?”\n\n“Not quite well!” Razumihin caught him up. “What next! He was\nunconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would you believe, Porfiry, as\nsoon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand,\nand gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight,\ndelirious all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!”\n\n“Really delirious? You don’t say so!” Porfiry shook his head in a\nwomanish way.\n\n“Nonsense! Don’t you believe it! But you don’t believe it anyway,”\n Raskolnikov let slip in his anger. But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem\nto catch those strange words.\n\n“But how could you have gone out if you hadn’t been delirious?”\n Razumihin got hot suddenly. “What did you go out for? What was the\nobject of it? And why on the sly? Were you in your senses when you did\nit? Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly.”\n\n“I was awfully sick of them yesterday.” Raskolnikov addressed Porfiry\nsuddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, “I ran away from them to\ntake lodgings where they wouldn’t find me, and took a lot of money with\nme. Mr. Zametov there saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible or\ndelirious yesterday; settle our dispute.”\n\nHe could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were his\nexpression and his silence to him.\n\n“In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were\nextremely irritable,” Zametov pronounced dryly.\n\n“And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day,” put in Porfiry Petrovitch,\n“that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had\nbeen run over.”\n\n“And there,” said Razumihin, “weren’t you mad then? You gave your last\npenny to the widow for the funeral. If you wanted to help, give fifteen\nor twenty even, but keep three roubles for yourself at least, but he\nflung away all the twenty-five at once!”\n\n“Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it? So\nthat’s why I was liberal yesterday.... Mr. Zametov knows I’ve found a\ntreasure! Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour\nwith such trivialities,” he said, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with\ntrembling lips. “We are boring you, aren’t we?”\n\n“Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only you knew how you\ninterest me! It’s interesting to look on and listen... and I am really\nglad you have come forward at last.”\n\n“But you might give us some tea! My throat’s dry,” cried Razumihin.\n\n“Capital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. Wouldn’t you\nlike... something more essential before tea?”\n\n“Get along with you!”\n\nPorfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.\n\nRaskolnikov’s thoughts were in a whirl. He was in terrible exasperation.\n\n“The worst of it is they don’t disguise it; they don’t care to stand on\nceremony! And how if you didn’t know me at all, did you come to talk\nto Nikodim Fomitch about me? So they don’t care to hide that they are\ntracking me like a pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face.” He was\nshaking with rage. “Come, strike me openly, don’t play with me like a\ncat with a mouse. It’s hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but perhaps I\nwon’t allow it! I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly\nfaces, and you’ll see how I despise you.” He could hardly breathe.\n“And what if it’s only my fancy? What if I am mistaken, and through\ninexperience I get angry and don’t keep up my nasty part? Perhaps it’s\nall unintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there is\nsomething about them.... It all might be said, but there is something.\nWhy did he say bluntly, ‘With her’? Why did Zametov add that I spoke\nartfully? Why do they speak in that tone? Yes, the tone.... Razumihin\nis sitting here, why does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never\ndoes see anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Of\ncourse it’s nonsense! What could he wink for? Are they trying to upset\nmy nerves or are they teasing me? Either it’s ill fancy or they know!\nEven Zametov is rude.... Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind.\nI foresaw he would change his mind! He is at home here, while it’s my\nfirst visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back\nto him. They’re as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! Not a doubt they\nwere talking about me before we came. Do they know about the flat? If\nonly they’d make haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he\nlet it pass.... I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use\nafterwards.... Delirious, indeed... ha-ha-ha! He knows all about last\nnight! He didn’t know of my mother’s arrival! The hag had written the\ndate on in pencil! You are wrong, you won’t catch me! There are no\nfacts... it’s all supposition! You produce facts! The flat even isn’t a\nfact but delirium. I know what to say to them.... Do they know about the\nflat? I won’t go without finding out. What did I come for? But my being\nangry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! Perhaps that’s\nright; to play the invalid.... He is feeling me. He will try to catch\nme. Why did I come?”\n\nAll this flashed like lightning through his mind.\n\nPorfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He became suddenly more jovial.\n\n“Your party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather.... And I am out\nof sorts altogether,” he began in quite a different tone, laughing to\nRazumihin.\n\n“Was it interesting? I left you yesterday at the most interesting point.\nWho got the best of it?”\n\n“Oh, no one, of course. They got on to everlasting questions, floated\noff into space.”\n\n“Only fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday. Whether there is such a\nthing as crime. I told you that we talked our heads off.”\n\n“What is there strange? It’s an everyday social question,” Raskolnikov\nanswered casually.\n\n“The question wasn’t put quite like that,” observed Porfiry.\n\n“Not quite, that’s true,” Razumihin agreed at once, getting warm and\nhurried as usual. “Listen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want to\nhear it. I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to\nhelp me. I told them you were coming.... It began with the socialist\ndoctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the\nabnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing\nmore; no other causes admitted!...”\n\n“You are wrong there,” cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was noticeably\nanimated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin, which made him\nmore excited than ever.\n\n“Nothing is admitted,” Razumihin interrupted with heat.\n\n“I am not wrong. I’ll show you their pamphlets. Everything with them\nis ‘the influence of environment,’ and nothing else. Their favourite\nphrase! From which it follows that, if society is normally organised,\nall crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest\nagainst and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature\nis not taken into account, it is excluded, it’s not supposed to exist!\nThey don’t recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living\nprocess, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a\nsocial system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going\nto organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an\ninstant, quicker than any living process! That’s why they instinctively\ndislike history, ‘nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,’ and they\nexplain it all as stupidity! That’s why they so dislike the _living_\nprocess of life; they don’t want a _living soul_! The living soul\ndemands life, the soul won’t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an\nobject of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though\nit smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not\nalive, has no will, is servile and won’t revolt! And it comes in the end\nto their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning\nof rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery is ready,\nindeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery--it\nwants life, it hasn’t completed its vital process, it’s too soon for the\ngraveyard! You can’t skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes three\npossibilities, but there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce\nit all to the question of comfort! That’s the easiest solution of the\nproblem! It’s seductively clear and you musn’t think about it. That’s\nthe great thing, you mustn’t think! The whole secret of life in two\npages of print!”\n\n“Now he is off, beating the drum! Catch hold of him, do!” laughed\nPorfiry. “Can you imagine,” he turned to Raskolnikov, “six people\nholding forth like that last night, in one room, with punch as a\npreliminary! No, brother, you are wrong, environment accounts for a\ngreat deal in crime; I can assure you of that.”\n\n“Oh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty violates a child\nof ten; was it environment drove him to it?”\n\n“Well, strictly speaking, it did,” Porfiry observed with noteworthy\ngravity; “a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the\ninfluence of environment.”\n\nRazumihin was almost in a frenzy. “Oh, if you like,” he roared. “I’ll\nprove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the\nChurch of Ivan the Great’s being two hundred and fifty feet high, and I\nwill prove it clearly, exactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal\ntendency! I undertake to! Will you bet on it?”\n\n“Done! Let’s hear, please, how he will prove it!”\n\n“He is always humbugging, confound him,” cried Razumihin, jumping up and\ngesticulating. “What’s the use of talking to you? He does all that\non purpose; you don’t know him, Rodion! He took their side yesterday,\nsimply to make fools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they\nwere delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. Last year he\npersuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two\nmonths. Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going\nto get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered\nnew clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There was no\nbride, nothing, all pure fantasy!”\n\n“Ah, you are wrong! I got the clothes before. It was the new clothes in\nfact that made me think of taking you in.”\n\n“Are you such a good dissembler?” Raskolnikov asked carelessly.\n\n“You wouldn’t have supposed it, eh? Wait a bit, I shall take you in,\ntoo. Ha-ha-ha! No, I’ll tell you the truth. All these questions about\ncrime, environment, children, recall to my mind an article of yours\nwhich interested me at the time. ‘On Crime’... or something of the\nsort, I forget the title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the\n_Periodical Review_.”\n\n“My article? In the _Periodical Review_?” Raskolnikov asked in\nastonishment. “I certainly did write an article upon a book six months\nago when I left the university, but I sent it to the _Weekly Review_.”\n\n“But it came out in the _Periodical_.”\n\n“And the _Weekly Review_ ceased to exist, so that’s why it wasn’t\nprinted at the time.”\n\n“That’s true; but when it ceased to exist, the _Weekly Review_ was\namalgamated with the _Periodical_, and so your article appeared two\nmonths ago in the latter. Didn’t you know?”\n\nRaskolnikov had not known.\n\n“Why, you might get some money out of them for the article! What a\nstrange person you are! You lead such a solitary life that you know\nnothing of matters that concern you directly. It’s a fact, I assure\nyou.”\n\n“Bravo, Rodya! I knew nothing about it either!” cried Razumihin. “I’ll\nrun to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number. Two months ago?\nWhat was the date? It doesn’t matter though, I will find it. Think of\nnot telling us!”\n\n“How did you find out that the article was mine? It’s only signed with\nan initial.”\n\n“I only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the editor; I know\nhim.... I was very much interested.”\n\n“I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and\nafter the crime.”\n\n“Yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always\naccompanied by illness. Very, very original, but... it was not that part\nof your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end of\nthe article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working\nit out clearly. There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are\ncertain persons who can... that is, not precisely are able to, but have\na perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the\nlaw is not for them.”\n\nRaskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his\nidea.\n\n“What? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not because of the\ninfluence of environment?” Razumihin inquired with some alarm even.\n\n“No, not exactly because of it,” answered Porfiry. “In his article all\nmen are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary.’ Ordinary men have\nto live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because,\ndon’t you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to\ncommit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they\nare extraordinary. That was your idea, if I am not mistaken?”\n\n“What do you mean? That can’t be right?” Razumihin muttered in\nbewilderment.\n\nRaskolnikov smiled again. He saw the point at once, and knew where they\nwanted to drive him. He decided to take up the challenge.\n\n“That wasn’t quite my contention,” he began simply and modestly. “Yet\nI admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like,\nperfectly so.” (It almost gave him pleasure to admit this.) “The only\ndifference is that I don’t contend that extraordinary people are always\nbound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt\nwhether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that an\n‘extraordinary’ man has the right... that is not an official right, but\nan inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certain\nobstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment\nof his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity).\nYou say that my article isn’t definite; I am ready to make it as clear\nas I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I\nmaintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have\nbeen made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a\nhundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have\nbeen in duty-bound... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men for\nthe sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But\nit does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people\nright and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I\nmaintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men,\nsuch as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without\nexception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they\ntransgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held\nsacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either,\nif that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence\nof ancient law--were of use to their cause. It’s remarkable, in fact,\nthat the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity\nwere guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great men\nor even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving\nsome new word, must from their very nature be criminals--more or less,\nof course. Otherwise it’s hard for them to get out of the common rut;\nand to remain in the common rut is what they can’t submit to, from their\nvery nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to\nit. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The\nsame thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for my\ndivision of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that\nit’s somewhat arbitrary, but I don’t insist upon exact numbers. I only\nbelieve in my leading idea that men are _in general_ divided by a law\nof nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say,\nmaterial that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have\nthe gift or the talent to utter _a new word_. There are, of course,\ninnumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both\ncategories are fairly well marked. The first category, generally\nspeaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live\nunder control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty\nto be controlled, because that’s their vocation, and there is nothing\nhumiliating in it for them. The second category all transgress the\nlaw; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their\ncapacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied;\nfor the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the\npresent for the sake of the better. But if such a one is forced for the\nsake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I\nmaintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading\nthrough blood--that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that.\nIt’s only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article\n(you remember it began with the legal question). There’s no need for\nsuch anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right,\nthey punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil\nquite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these\ncriminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or\nless). The first category is always the man of the present, the second\nthe man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the\nsecond move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal\nright to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me--and _vive la\nguerre éternelle_--till the New Jerusalem, of course!”\n\n“Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?”\n\n“I do,” Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and during\nthe whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet.\n\n“And... and do you believe in God? Excuse my curiosity.”\n\n“I do,” repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry.\n\n“And... do you believe in Lazarus’ rising from the dead?”\n\n“I... I do. Why do you ask all this?”\n\n“You believe it literally?”\n\n“Literally.”\n\n“You don’t say so.... I asked from curiosity. Excuse me. But let us\ngo back to the question; they are not always executed. Some, on the\ncontrary...”\n\n“Triumph in their lifetime? Oh, yes, some attain their ends in this\nlife, and then...”\n\n“They begin executing other people?”\n\n“If it’s necessary; indeed, for the most part they do. Your remark is\nvery witty.”\n\n“Thank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary\npeople from the ordinary ones? Are there signs at their birth? I feel\nthere ought to be more exactitude, more external definition. Excuse the\nnatural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn’t they\nadopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn’t they wear something, be\nbranded in some way? For you know if confusion arises and a member of\none category imagines that he belongs to the other, begins to ‘eliminate\nobstacles’ as you so happily expressed it, then...”\n\n“Oh, that very often happens! That remark is wittier than the other.”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in\nthe first category, that is among the ordinary people (as I perhaps\nunfortunately called them). In spite of their predisposition to\nobedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimes\nvouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people,\n‘destroyers,’ and to push themselves into the ‘new movement,’ and\nthis quite sincerely. Meanwhile the really _new_ people are very often\nunobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling\ntendencies. But I don’t think there is any considerable danger here,\nand you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far. Of course,\nthey might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away\nwith them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, even\nthis isn’t necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are very\nconscientious: some perform this service for one another and others\nchastise themselves with their own hands.... They will impose various\npublic acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying\neffect; in fact you’ve nothing to be uneasy about.... It’s a law of\nnature.”\n\n“Well, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but\nthere’s another thing worries me. Tell me, please, are there many people\nwho have the right to kill others, these extraordinary people? I am\nready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it’s alarming\nif there are a great many of them, eh?”\n\n“Oh, you needn’t worry about that either,” Raskolnikov went on in the\nsame tone. “People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for\nsaying something _new_, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily\nso in fact. One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these\ngrades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity\nsome law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am\nconvinced that it exists, and one day may become known. The vast mass of\nmankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort,\nby some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and\nstocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a\nthousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps--I\nspeak roughly, approximately--is born with some independence, and with\nstill greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius\nis one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity,\nappear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I have\nnot peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there\ncertainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of\nchance.”\n\n“Why, are you both joking?” Razumihin cried at last. “There you sit,\nmaking fun of one another. Are you serious, Rodya?”\n\nRaskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply.\nAnd the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and _discourteous_ sarcasm of\nPorfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.\n\n“Well, brother, if you are really serious... You are right, of course,\nin saying that it’s not new, that it’s like what we’ve read and heard a\nthousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is\nexclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed\n_in the name of conscience_, and, excuse my saying so, with such\nfanaticism.... That, I take it, is the point of your article. But that\nsanction of bloodshed _by conscience_ is to my mind... more terrible\nthan the official, legal sanction of bloodshed....”\n\n“You are quite right, it is more terrible,” Porfiry agreed.\n\n“Yes, you must have exaggerated! There is some mistake, I shall read it.\nYou can’t think that! I shall read it.”\n\n“All that is not in the article, there’s only a hint of it,” said\nRaskolnikov.\n\n“Yes, yes.” Porfiry couldn’t sit still. “Your attitude to crime is\npretty clear to me now, but... excuse me for my impertinence (I am\nreally ashamed to be worrying you like this), you see, you’ve removed\nmy anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed, but... there are various\npractical possibilities that make me uneasy! What if some man or youth\nimagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet--a future one of course--and\nsuppose he begins to remove all obstacles.... He has some great\nenterprise before him and needs money for it... and tries to get it...\ndo you see?”\n\nZametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner. Raskolnikov did not even\nraise his eyes to him.\n\n“I must admit,” he went on calmly, “that such cases certainly must\narise. The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that\nsnare; young people especially.”\n\n“Yes, you see. Well then?”\n\n“What then?” Raskolnikov smiled in reply; “that’s not my fault. So it is\nand so it always will be. He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin)\nthat I sanction bloodshed. Society is too well protected by prisons,\nbanishment, criminal investigators, penal servitude. There’s no need to\nbe uneasy. You have but to catch the thief.”\n\n“And what if we do catch him?”\n\n“Then he gets what he deserves.”\n\n“You are certainly logical. But what of his conscience?”\n\n“Why do you care about that?”\n\n“Simply from humanity.”\n\n“If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be his\npunishment--as well as the prison.”\n\n“But the real geniuses,” asked Razumihin frowning, “those who have\nthe right to murder? Oughtn’t they to suffer at all even for the blood\nthey’ve shed?”\n\n“Why the word _ought_? It’s not a matter of permission or prohibition.\nHe will suffer if he is sorry for his victim. Pain and suffering are\nalways inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The\nreally great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth,” he added\ndreamily, not in the tone of the conversation.\n\nHe raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, and took his\ncap. He was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance, and\nhe felt this. Everyone got up.\n\n“Well, you may abuse me, be angry with me if you like,” Porfiry\nPetrovitch began again, “but I can’t resist. Allow me one little\nquestion (I know I am troubling you). There is just one little notion I\nwant to express, simply that I may not forget it.”\n\n“Very good, tell me your little notion,” Raskolnikov stood waiting, pale\nand grave before him.\n\n“Well, you see... I really don’t know how to express it properly....\nIt’s a playful, psychological idea.... When you were writing your\narticle, surely you couldn’t have helped, he-he! fancying yourself...\njust a little, an ‘extraordinary’ man, uttering a _new word_ in your\nsense.... That’s so, isn’t it?”\n\n“Quite possibly,” Raskolnikov answered contemptuously.\n\nRazumihin made a movement.\n\n“And, if so, could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties\nand hardship or for some service to humanity--to overstep obstacles?...\nFor instance, to rob and murder?”\n\nAnd again he winked with his left eye, and laughed noiselessly just as\nbefore.\n\n“If I did I certainly should not tell you,” Raskolnikov answered with\ndefiant and haughty contempt.\n\n“No, I was only interested on account of your article, from a literary\npoint of view...”\n\n“Foo! how obvious and insolent that is!” Raskolnikov thought with\nrepulsion.\n\n“Allow me to observe,” he answered dryly, “that I don’t consider myself\na Mahomet or a Napoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and not being\none of them I cannot tell you how I should act.”\n\n“Oh, come, don’t we all think ourselves Napoleons now in Russia?”\n Porfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity.\n\nSomething peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice.\n\n“Perhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did for Alyona\nIvanovna last week?” Zametov blurted out from the corner.\n\nRaskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intently at Porfiry.\nRazumihin was scowling gloomily. He seemed before this to be noticing\nsomething. He looked angrily around. There was a minute of gloomy\nsilence. Raskolnikov turned to go.\n\n“Are you going already?” Porfiry said amiably, holding out his hand with\nexcessive politeness. “Very, very glad of your acquaintance. As for your\nrequest, have no uneasiness, write just as I told you, or, better still,\ncome to me there yourself in a day or two... to-morrow, indeed. I shall\nbe there at eleven o’clock for certain. We’ll arrange it all; we’ll have\na talk. As one of the last to be _there_, you might perhaps be able to\ntell us something,” he added with a most good-natured expression.\n\n“You want to cross-examine me officially in due form?” Raskolnikov asked\nsharply.\n\n“Oh, why? That’s not necessary for the present. You misunderstand me.\nI lose no opportunity, you see, and... I’ve talked with all who had\npledges.... I obtained evidence from some of them, and you are the\nlast.... Yes, by the way,” he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, “I\njust remember, what was I thinking of?” he turned to Razumihin, “you\nwere talking my ears off about that Nikolay... of course, I know, I know\nvery well,” he turned to Raskolnikov, “that the fellow is innocent, but\nwhat is one to do? We had to trouble Dmitri too.... This is the point,\nthis is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven, wasn’t it?”\n\n“Yes,” answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very\nmoment he spoke that he need not have said it.\n\n“Then when you went upstairs between seven and eight, didn’t you see in\na flat that stood open on a second storey, do you remember? two workmen\nor at least one of them? They were painting there, didn’t you notice\nthem? It’s very, very important for them.”\n\n“Painters? No, I didn’t see them,” Raskolnikov answered slowly, as\nthough ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was racking\nevery nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as\npossible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything. “No, I didn’t\nsee them, and I don’t think I noticed a flat like that open.... But on\nthe fourth storey” (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant)\n“I remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona\nIvanovna’s.... I remember... I remember it clearly. Some porters\nwere carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall. But\npainters... no, I don’t remember that there were any painters, and I\ndon’t think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn’t.”\n\n“What do you mean?” Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had\nreflected and realised. “Why, it was on the day of the murder the\npainters were at work, and he was there three days before? What are you\nasking?”\n\n“Foo! I have muddled it!” Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead.\n“Deuce take it! This business is turning my brain!” he addressed\nRaskolnikov somewhat apologetically. “It would be such a great thing for\nus to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at\nthe flat, so I fancied you could perhaps have told us something.... I\nquite muddled it.”\n\n“Then you should be more careful,” Razumihin observed grimly.\n\nThe last words were uttered in the passage. Porfiry Petrovitch saw them\nto the door with excessive politeness.\n\nThey went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for some steps they\ndid not say a word. Raskolnikov drew a deep breath.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n“I don’t believe it, I can’t believe it!” repeated Razumihin, trying in\nperplexity to refute Raskolnikov’s arguments.\n\nThey were by now approaching Bakaleyev’s lodgings, where Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while. Razumihin\nkept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion, confused and excited\nby the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about\n_it_.\n\n“Don’t believe it, then!” answered Raskolnikov, with a cold, careless\nsmile. “You were noticing nothing as usual, but I was weighing every\nword.”\n\n“You are suspicious. That is why you weighed their words... h’m...\ncertainly, I agree, Porfiry’s tone was rather strange, and still\nmore that wretch Zametov!... You are right, there was something about\nhim--but why? Why?”\n\n“He has changed his mind since last night.”\n\n“Quite the contrary! If they had that brainless idea, they would do\ntheir utmost to hide it, and conceal their cards, so as to catch you\nafterwards.... But it was all impudent and careless.”\n\n“If they had had facts--I mean, real facts--or at least grounds for\nsuspicion, then they would certainly have tried to hide their game,\nin the hope of getting more (they would have made a search long ago\nbesides). But they have no facts, not one. It is all mirage--all\nambiguous. Simply a floating idea. So they try to throw me out by\nimpudence. And perhaps, he was irritated at having no facts, and blurted\nit out in his vexation--or perhaps he has some plan... he seems an\nintelligent man. Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to\nknow. They have a psychology of their own, brother. But it is loathsome\nexplaining it all. Stop!”\n\n“And it’s insulting, insulting! I understand you. But... since we have\nspoken openly now (and it is an excellent thing that we have at last--I\nam glad) I will own now frankly that I noticed it in them long ago,\nthis idea. Of course the merest hint only--an insinuation--but why an\ninsinuation even? How dare they? What foundation have they? If only you\nknew how furious I have been. Think only! Simply because a poor student,\nunhinged by poverty and hypochondria, on the eve of a severe delirious\nillness (note that), suspicious, vain, proud, who has not seen a soul to\nspeak to for six months, in rags and in boots without soles, has to\nface some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence; and\nthe unexpected debt thrust under his nose, the I.O.U. presented\nby Tchebarov, the new paint, thirty degrees Reaumur and a stifling\natmosphere, a crowd of people, the talk about the murder of a person\nwhere he had been just before, and all that on an empty stomach--he\nmight well have a fainting fit! And that, that is what they found it\nall on! Damn them! I understand how annoying it is, but in your place,\nRodya, I would laugh at them, or better still, spit in their ugly faces,\nand spit a dozen times in all directions. I’d hit out in all\ndirections, neatly too, and so I’d put an end to it. Damn them! Don’t be\ndownhearted. It’s a shame!”\n\n“He really has put it well, though,” Raskolnikov thought.\n\n“Damn them? But the cross-examination again, to-morrow?” he said with\nbitterness. “Must I really enter into explanations with them? I feel\nvexed as it is, that I condescended to speak to Zametov yesterday in the\nrestaurant....”\n\n“Damn it! I will go myself to Porfiry. I will squeeze it out of him, as\none of the family: he must let me know the ins and outs of it all! And\nas for Zametov...”\n\n“At last he sees through him!” thought Raskolnikov.\n\n“Stay!” cried Razumihin, seizing him by the shoulder again. “Stay! you\nwere wrong. I have thought it out. You are wrong! How was that a trap?\nYou say that the question about the workmen was a trap. But if you had\ndone _that_, could you have said you had seen them painting the flat...\nand the workmen? On the contrary, you would have seen nothing, even if\nyou had seen it. Who would own it against himself?”\n\n“If I had done _that thing_, I should certainly have said that I had\nseen the workmen and the flat,” Raskolnikov answered, with reluctance\nand obvious disgust.\n\n“But why speak against yourself?”\n\n“Because only peasants, or the most inexperienced novices deny\neverything flatly at examinations. If a man is ever so little developed\nand experienced, he will certainly try to admit all the external facts\nthat can’t be avoided, but will seek other explanations of them, will\nintroduce some special, unexpected turn, that will give them another\nsignificance and put them in another light. Porfiry might well reckon\nthat I should be sure to answer so, and say I had seen them to give an\nair of truth, and then make some explanation.”\n\n“But he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been\nthere two days before, and that therefore you must have been there on\nthe day of the murder at eight o’clock. And so he would have caught you\nover a detail.”\n\n“Yes, that is what he was reckoning on, that I should not have time to\nreflect, and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer, and\nso would forget that the workmen could not have been there two days\nbefore.”\n\n“But how could you forget it?”\n\n“Nothing easier. It is in just such stupid things clever people are most\neasily caught. The more cunning a man is, the less he suspects that he\nwill be caught in a simple thing. The more cunning a man is, the simpler\nthe trap he must be caught in. Porfiry is not such a fool as you\nthink....”\n\n“He is a knave then, if that is so!”\n\nRaskolnikov could not help laughing. But at the very moment, he was\nstruck by the strangeness of his own frankness, and the eagerness\nwith which he had made this explanation, though he had kept up all the\npreceding conversation with gloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive,\nfrom necessity.\n\n“I am getting a relish for certain aspects!” he thought to himself.\nBut almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy, as though an\nunexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him. His uneasiness kept on\nincreasing. They had just reached the entrance to Bakaleyev’s.\n\n“Go in alone!” said Raskolnikov suddenly. “I will be back directly.”\n\n“Where are you going? Why, we are just here.”\n\n“I can’t help it.... I will come in half an hour. Tell them.”\n\n“Say what you like, I will come with you.”\n\n“You, too, want to torture me!” he screamed, with such bitter\nirritation, such despair in his eyes that Razumihin’s hands dropped.\nHe stood for some time on the steps, looking gloomily at Raskolnikov\nstriding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging. At last, gritting\nhis teeth and clenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze Porfiry\nlike a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their long absence.\n\nWhen Raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with sweat and he was\nbreathing heavily. He went rapidly up the stairs, walked into his\nunlocked room and at once fastened the latch. Then in senseless terror\nhe rushed to the corner, to that hole under the paper where he had put\nthe things; put his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the\nhole, in every crack and fold of the paper. Finding nothing, he got up\nand drew a deep breath. As he was reaching the steps of Bakaleyev’s, he\nsuddenly fancied that something, a chain, a stud or even a bit of paper\nin which they had been wrapped with the old woman’s handwriting on it,\nmight somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and then\nmight suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evidence against him.\n\nHe stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, half\nsenseless smile strayed on his lips. He took his cap at last and went\nquietly out of the room. His ideas were all tangled. He went dreamily\nthrough the gateway.\n\n“Here he is himself,” shouted a loud voice.\n\nHe raised his head.\n\nThe porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing\nhim out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat\nand a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman. He\nstooped, and his head in a greasy cap hung forward. From his wrinkled\nflabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat and\nthey looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.\n\n“What is it?” Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter.\n\nThe man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him\nattentively, deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of the\ngate into the street without saying a word.\n\n“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.\n\n“Why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your\nname and whom you lodged with. I saw you coming and pointed you out and\nhe went away. It’s funny.”\n\nThe porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, and after\nwondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room.\n\nRaskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight of\nhim walking along the other side of the street with the same even,\ndeliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground, as though in\nmeditation. He soon overtook him, but for some time walked behind him.\nAt last, moving on to a level with him, he looked at his face. The man\nnoticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes again;\nand so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word.\n\n“You were inquiring for me... of the porter?” Raskolnikov said at last,\nbut in a curiously quiet voice.\n\nThe man made no answer; he didn’t even look at him. Again they were both\nsilent.\n\n“Why do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... What’s the\nmeaning of it?”\n\nRaskolnikov’s voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words\nclearly.\n\nThe man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at\nRaskolnikov.\n\n“Murderer!” he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice.\n\nRaskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt suddenly weak, a\ncold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for\na moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free. So\nthey walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.\n\nThe man did not look at him.\n\n“What do you mean... what is.... Who is a murderer?” muttered\nRaskolnikov hardly audibly.\n\n“_You_ are a murderer,” the man answered still more articulately and\nemphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he looked\nstraight into Raskolnikov’s pale face and stricken eyes.\n\nThey had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned to the left\nwithout looking behind him. Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after\nhim. He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still\nstanding there. Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that\nhe was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.\n\nWith slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his way\nback to his little garret, feeling chilled all over. He took off his cap\nand put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving.\nThen he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he\nstretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.\n\nHe thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some\nimages without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of\npeople he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would\nnever have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table\nin a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars\nin some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite\ndark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the\nSunday bells floating in from somewhere.... The images followed one\nanother, whirling like a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried\nto clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression\nwithin him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even\npleasant.... The slight shivering still persisted, but that too\nwas an almost pleasant sensation.\n\nHe heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and\npretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door and stood for some\ntime in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly into\nthe room and went cautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasya’s\nwhisper:\n\n“Don’t disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his dinner later.”\n\n“Quite so,” answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully and closed the\ndoor. Another half-hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned on\nhis back again, clasping his hands behind his head.\n\n“Who is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? Where was he,\nwhat did he see? He has seen it all, that’s clear. Where was he then?\nAnd from where did he see? Why has he only now sprung out of the earth?\nAnd how could he see? Is it possible? Hm...” continued Raskolnikov,\nturning cold and shivering, “and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the\ndoor--was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal line and you\ncan build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly flew by and saw it! Is it\npossible?” He felt with sudden loathing how weak, how physically weak he\nhad become. “I ought to have known it,” he thought with a bitter smile.\n“And how dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take up an\naxe and shed blood! I ought to have known beforehand.... Ah, but I did\nknow!” he whispered in despair. At times he came to a standstill at some\nthought.\n\n“No, those men are not made so. The real _Master_ to whom all is\npermitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, _forgets_ an army in\nEgypt, _wastes_ half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off\nwith a jest at Vilna. And altars are set up to him after his death, and\nso _all_ is permitted. No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but\nof bronze!”\n\nOne sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. Napoleon, the\npyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with\na red trunk under her bed--it’s a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to\ndigest! How can they digest it! It’s too inartistic. “A Napoleon creep\nunder an old woman’s bed! Ugh, how loathsome!”\n\nAt moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of feverish\nexcitement. “The old woman is of no consequence,” he thought, hotly and\nincoherently. “The old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is not\nwhat matters! The old woman was only an illness.... I was in a hurry to\noverstep.... I didn’t kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the\nprinciple, but I didn’t overstep, I stopped on this side.... I was\nonly capable of killing. And it seems I wasn’t even capable of that...\nPrinciple? Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists? They are\nindustrious, commercial people; ‘the happiness of all’ is their case.\nNo, life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; I\ndon’t want to wait for ‘the happiness of all.’ I want to live myself,\nor else better not live at all. I simply couldn’t pass by my mother\nstarving, keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the\n‘happiness of all.’ I am putting my little brick into the happiness of\nall and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let me slip? I only\nlive once, I too want.... Ech, I am an æsthetic louse and nothing\nmore,” he added suddenly, laughing like a madman. “Yes, I am certainly a\nlouse,” he went on, clutching at the idea, gloating over it and playing\nwith it with vindictive pleasure. “In the first place, because I can\nreason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been\ntroubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for\nmy own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble\nobject--ha-ha! Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as\npossible, weighing, measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I picked\nout the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I\nneeded for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have gone\nto a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!). And what shows that I\nam utterly a louse,” he added, grinding his teeth, “is that I am\nperhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed, and _I felt\nbeforehand_ that I should tell myself so _after_ killing her. Can\nanything be compared with the horror of that? The vulgarity! The\nabjectness! I understand the ‘prophet’ with his sabre, on his steed:\nAllah commands and ‘trembling’ creation must obey! The ‘prophet’ is\nright, he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up\nthe innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain! It’s for you to\nobey, trembling creation, and not _to have desires_, for that’s not for\nyou!... I shall never, never forgive the old woman!”\n\nHis hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were parched, his\neyes were fixed on the ceiling.\n\n“Mother, sister--how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hate\nthem, I feel a physical hatred for them, I can’t bear them near me....\nI went up to my mother and kissed her, I remember.... To embrace her\nand think if she only knew... shall I tell her then? That’s just what\nI might do.... _She_ must be the same as I am,” he added, straining\nhimself to think, as it were struggling with delirium. “Ah, how I hate\nthe old woman now! I feel I should kill her again if she came to life!\nPoor Lizaveta! Why did she come in?... It’s strange though, why is it\nI scarcely ever think of her, as though I hadn’t killed her? Lizaveta!\nSonia! Poor gentle things, with gentle eyes.... Dear women! Why don’t\nthey weep? Why don’t they moan? They give up everything... their eyes\nare soft and gentle.... Sonia, Sonia! Gentle Sonia!”\n\nHe lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didn’t remember\nhow he got into the street. It was late evening. The twilight had fallen\nand the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a\npeculiar breathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in the\nstreet; workmen and business people were making their way home; other\npeople had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and\nstagnant water. Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he was\ndistinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do\nsomething in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten. Suddenly he\nstood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street,\nbeckoning to him. He crossed over to him, but at once the man turned and\nwalked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign to\nhim. “Stay, did he really beckon?” Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried\nto overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised him and\nwas frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long\ncoat. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;\nthey went down a turning; the man still did not look round. “Does he\nknow I am following him?” thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the\ngateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in\nto see whether he would look round and sign to him. In the court-yard\nthe man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at\nonce followed him into the yard, but the man was gone. He must have\ngone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He heard\nslow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangely\nfamiliar. He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone\nthrough the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he\nreached the second floor. Bah! this is the flat where the painters were\nat work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps\nof the man above had died away. “So he must have stopped or hidden\nsomewhere.” He reached the third storey, should he go on? There was a\nstillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his own\nfootsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must be\nhiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he\nhesitated and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as\nthough everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour\nwhich was flooded with moonlight. Everything there was as before, the\nchairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the\nframes. A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows.\n“It’s the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery,” thought\nRaskolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more\nsilent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it was\npainful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp\ncrack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again. A fly\nflew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz. At\nthat moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little\ncupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. “Why is that cloak\nhere?” he thought, “it wasn’t there before....” He went up to it quietly\nand felt that there was someone hiding behind it. He cautiously moved\nthe cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent\ndouble so that he couldn’t see her face; but it was she. He stood over\nher. “She is afraid,” he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the\nnoose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. But strange\nto say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood. He was\nfrightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too,\nbent her head lower. He bent right down to the ground and peeped up\ninto her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old\nwoman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing\nher utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he fancied that the door\nfrom the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and\nwhispering within. He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the\nold woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe\nthe laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old\nwoman was simply shaking with mirth. He was rushing away, but the\npassage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the\nlanding, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of\nheads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.\nSomething gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, they\nwould not move.... He tried to scream and woke up.\n\nHe drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist:\nhis door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the\ndoorway watching him intently.\n\nRaskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them\nagain. He lay on his back without stirring.\n\n“Is it still a dream?” he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly\nperceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching\nhim.\n\nHe stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after\nhim, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes on\nRaskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he\nput his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane\nand his chin on his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to wait\nindefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen\nglances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost\nwhitish beard.\n\nTen minutes passed. It was still light, but beginning to get dusk. There\nwas complete stillness in the room. Not a sound came from the stairs.\nOnly a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane. It was\nunbearable at last. Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.\n\n“Come, tell me what you want.”\n\n“I knew you were not asleep, but only pretending,” the stranger answered\noddly, laughing calmly. “Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, allow me to\nintroduce myself....”\n\n\n\n\nPART IV\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n“Can this be still a dream?” Raskolnikov thought once more.\n\nHe looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor.\n\n“Svidrigaïlov! What nonsense! It can’t be!” he said at last aloud in\nbewilderment.\n\nHis visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation.\n\n“I’ve come to you for two reasons. In the first place, I wanted to make\nyour personal acquaintance, as I have already heard a great deal about\nyou that is interesting and flattering; secondly, I cherish the hope\nthat you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the\nwelfare of your sister, Avdotya Romanovna. For without your support she\nmight not let me come near her now, for she is prejudiced against me,\nbut with your assistance I reckon on...”\n\n“You reckon wrongly,” interrupted Raskolnikov.\n\n“They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?”\n\nRaskolnikov made no reply.\n\n“It was yesterday, I know. I only arrived myself the day before. Well,\nlet me tell you this, Rodion Romanovitch, I don’t consider it necessary\nto justify myself, but kindly tell me what was there particularly\ncriminal on my part in all this business, speaking without prejudice,\nwith common sense?”\n\nRaskolnikov continued to look at him in silence.\n\n“That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and ‘insulted her\nwith my infamous proposals’--is that it? (I am anticipating you.) But\nyou’ve only to assume that I, too, am a man _et nihil humanum_... in a\nword, that I am capable of being attracted and falling in love (which\ndoes not depend on our will), then everything can be explained in the\nmost natural manner. The question is, am I a monster, or am I myself\na victim? And what if I am a victim? In proposing to the object of my\npassion to elope with me to America or Switzerland, I may have cherished\nthe deepest respect for her and may have thought that I was promoting\nour mutual happiness! Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why,\nprobably, I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!”\n\n“But that’s not the point,” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust. “It’s\nsimply that whether you are right or wrong, we dislike you. We don’t\nwant to have anything to do with you. We show you the door. Go out!”\n\nSvidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh.\n\n“But you’re... but there’s no getting round you,” he said, laughing in\nthe frankest way. “I hoped to get round you, but you took up the right\nline at once!”\n\n“But you are trying to get round me still!”\n\n“What of it? What of it?” cried Svidrigaïlov, laughing openly. “But this\nis what the French call _bonne guerre_, and the most innocent form of\ndeception!... But still you have interrupted me; one way or another, I\nrepeat again: there would never have been any unpleasantness except for\nwhat happened in the garden. Marfa Petrovna...”\n\n“You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna, too, so they say?” Raskolnikov\ninterrupted rudely.\n\n“Oh, you’ve heard that, too, then? You’d be sure to, though.... But\nas for your question, I really don’t know what to say, though my own\nconscience is quite at rest on that score. Don’t suppose that I am in\nany apprehension about it. All was regular and in order; the medical\ninquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy\ndinner and a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved nothing\nelse. But I’ll tell you what I have been thinking to myself of late, on\nmy way here in the train, especially: didn’t I contribute to all that...\ncalamity, morally, in a way, by irritation or something of the\nsort. But I came to the conclusion that that, too, was quite out of the\nquestion.”\n\nRaskolnikov laughed.\n\n“I wonder you trouble yourself about it!”\n\n“But what are you laughing at? Only consider, I struck her just twice\nwith a switch--there were no marks even... don’t regard me as a cynic,\nplease; I am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that;\nbut I know for certain, too, that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased\nat my, so to say, warmth. The story of your sister had been wrung out to\nthe last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been forced to\nsit at home; she had nothing to show herself with in the town. Besides,\nshe had bored them so with that letter (you heard about her reading the\nletter). And all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven! Her\nfirst act was to order the carriage to be got out.... Not to speak\nof the fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to be\ninsulted in spite of all their show of indignation. There are instances\nof it with everyone; human beings in general, indeed, greatly love to\nbe insulted, have you noticed that? But it’s particularly so with women.\nOne might even say it’s their only amusement.”\n\nAt one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so\nfinishing the interview. But some curiosity and even a sort of prudence\nmade him linger for a moment.\n\n“You are fond of fighting?” he asked carelessly.\n\n“No, not very,” Svidrigaïlov answered, calmly. “And Marfa Petrovna and\nI scarcely ever fought. We lived very harmoniously, and she was always\npleased with me. I only used the whip twice in all our seven years (not\ncounting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character). The first\ntime, two months after our marriage, immediately after we arrived in the\ncountry, and the last time was that of which we are speaking. Did you\nsuppose I was such a monster, such a reactionary, such a slave driver?\nHa, ha! By the way, do you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years\nago, in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I’ve forgotten\nhis name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the papers, for having\nthrashed a German woman in the railway train. You remember? It was in\nthose days, that very year I believe, the ‘disgraceful action of the\n_Age_’ took place (you know, ‘The Egyptian Nights,’ that public reading,\nyou remember? The dark eyes, you know! Ah, the golden days of our youth,\nwhere are they?). Well, as for the gentleman who thrashed the German,\nI feel no sympathy with him, because after all what need is there\nfor sympathy? But I must say that there are sometimes such provoking\n‘Germans’ that I don’t believe there is a progressive who could quite\nanswer for himself. No one looked at the subject from that point of view\nthen, but that’s the truly humane point of view, I assure you.”\n\nAfter saying this, Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh again.\nRaskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his\nmind and able to keep it to himself.\n\n“I expect you’ve not talked to anyone for some days?” he asked.\n\n“Scarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering at my being such an\nadaptable man?”\n\n“No, I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man.”\n\n“Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your questions? Is that\nit? But why take offence? As you asked, so I answered,” he replied,\nwith a surprising expression of simplicity. “You know, there’s\nhardly anything I take interest in,” he went on, as it were dreamily,\n“especially now, I’ve nothing to do.... You are quite at liberty to\nimagine though that I am making up to you with a motive, particularly as\nI told you I want to see your sister about something. But I’ll confess\nfrankly, I am very much bored. The last three days especially, so I am\ndelighted to see you.... Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, but you\nseem to be somehow awfully strange yourself. Say what you like, there’s\nsomething wrong with you, and now, too... not this very minute, I mean,\nbut now, generally.... Well, well, I won’t, I won’t, don’t scowl! I am\nnot such a bear, you know, as you think.”\n\nRaskolnikov looked gloomily at him.\n\n“You are not a bear, perhaps, at all,” he said. “I fancy indeed that\nyou are a man of very good breeding, or at least know how on occasion to\nbehave like one.”\n\n“I am not particularly interested in anyone’s opinion,” Svidrigaïlov\nanswered, dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness, “and therefore why\nnot be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our\nclimate... and especially if one has a natural propensity that way,” he\nadded, laughing again.\n\n“But I’ve heard you have many friends here. You are, as they say, ‘not\nwithout connections.’ What can you want with me, then, unless you’ve\nsome special object?”\n\n“That’s true that I have friends here,” Svidrigaïlov admitted, not\nreplying to the chief point. “I’ve met some already. I’ve been lounging\nabout for the last three days, and I’ve seen them, or they’ve seen me.\nThat’s a matter of course. I am well dressed and reckoned not a poor\nman; the emancipation of the serfs hasn’t affected me; my property\nconsists chiefly of forests and water meadows. The revenue has not\nfallen off; but... I am not going to see them, I was sick of them long\nago. I’ve been here three days and have called on no one.... What a town\nit is! How has it come into existence among us, tell me that? A town of\nofficials and students of all sorts. Yes, there’s a great deal I didn’t\nnotice when I was here eight years ago, kicking up my heels.... My only\nhope now is in anatomy, by Jove, it is!”\n\n“Anatomy?”\n\n“But as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, indeed,\nmaybe--well, all that can go on without me,” he went on, again without\nnoticing the question. “Besides, who wants to be a card-sharper?”\n\n“Why, have you been a card-sharper then?”\n\n“How could I help being? There was a regular set of us, men of the best\nsociety, eight years ago; we had a fine time. And all men of breeding,\nyou know, poets, men of property. And indeed as a rule in our Russian\nsociety the best manners are found among those who’ve been thrashed,\nhave you noticed that? I’ve deteriorated in the country. But I did get\ninto prison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Nezhin. Then\nMarfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with him and bought me off for\nthirty thousand silver pieces (I owed seventy thousand). We were united\nin lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure.\nYou know she was five years older than I. She was very fond of me. For\nseven years I never left the country. And, take note, that all my life\nshe held a document over me, the IOU for thirty thousand roubles, so\nif I were to elect to be restive about anything I should be trapped at\nonce! And she would have done it! Women find nothing incompatible in\nthat.”\n\n“If it hadn’t been for that, would you have given her the slip?”\n\n“I don’t know what to say. It was scarcely the document restrained me. I\ndidn’t want to go anywhere else. Marfa Petrovna herself invited me to go\nabroad, seeing I was bored, but I’ve been abroad before, and always\nfelt sick there. For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the\nsea--you look at them and it makes you sad. What’s most revolting is\nthat one is really sad! No, it’s better at home. Here at least one\nblames others for everything and excuses oneself. I should have gone\nperhaps on an expedition to the North Pole, because _j’ai le vin\nmauvais_ and hate drinking, and there’s nothing left but wine. I have\ntried it. But, I say, I’ve been told Berg is going up in a great balloon\nnext Sunday from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers at a\nfee. Is it true?”\n\n“Why, would you go up?”\n\n“I... No, oh, no,” muttered Svidrigaïlov really seeming to be deep in\nthought.\n\n“What does he mean? Is he in earnest?” Raskolnikov wondered.\n\n“No, the document didn’t restrain me,” Svidrigaïlov went on,\nmeditatively. “It was my own doing, not leaving the country, and nearly\na year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back the document on my name-day\nand made me a present of a considerable sum of money, too. She had a\nfortune, you know. ‘You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch’--that\nwas actually her expression. You don’t believe she used it? But do\nyou know I managed the estate quite decently, they know me in the\nneighbourhood. I ordered books, too. Marfa Petrovna at first approved,\nbut afterwards she was afraid of my over-studying.”\n\n“You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?”\n\n“Missing her? Perhaps. Really, perhaps I am. And, by the way, do you\nbelieve in ghosts?”\n\n“What ghosts?”\n\n“Why, ordinary ghosts.”\n\n“Do you believe in them?”\n\n“Perhaps not, _pour vous plaire_.... I wouldn’t say no exactly.”\n\n“Do you see them, then?”\n\nSvidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly.\n\n“Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me,” he said, twisting his mouth\ninto a strange smile.\n\n“How do you mean ‘she is pleased to visit you’?”\n\n“She has been three times. I saw her first on the very day of the\nfuneral, an hour after she was buried. It was the day before I left to\ncome here. The second time was the day before yesterday, at daybreak, on\nthe journey at the station of Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two\nhours ago in the room where I am staying. I was alone.”\n\n“Were you awake?”\n\n“Quite awake. I was wide awake every time. She comes, speaks to me for\na minute and goes out at the door--always at the door. I can almost hear\nher.”\n\n“What made me think that something of the sort must be happening to\nyou?” Raskolnikov said suddenly.\n\nAt the same moment he was surprised at having said it. He was much\nexcited.\n\n“What! Did you think so?” Svidrigaïlov asked in astonishment. “Did you\nreally? Didn’t I say that there was something in common between us, eh?”\n\n“You never said so!” Raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat.\n\n“Didn’t I?”\n\n“No!”\n\n“I thought I did. When I came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut,\npretending, I said to myself at once, ‘Here’s the man.’”\n\n“What do you mean by ‘the man?’ What are you talking about?” cried\nRaskolnikov.\n\n“What do I mean? I really don’t know....” Svidrigaïlov muttered\ningenuously, as though he, too, were puzzled.\n\nFor a minute they were silent. They stared in each other’s faces.\n\n“That’s all nonsense!” Raskolnikov shouted with vexation. “What does she\nsay when she comes to you?”\n\n“She! Would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles and--man\nis a strange creature--it makes me angry. The first time she came in (I\nwas tired you know: the funeral service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch\nafterwards. At last I was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and\nbegan to think), she came in at the door. ‘You’ve been so busy to-day,\nArkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock,’\nshe said. All those seven years I’ve wound that clock every week, and if\nI forgot it she would always remind me. The next day I set off on my way\nhere. I got out at the station at daybreak; I’d been asleep, tired out,\nwith my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee. I looked up and\nthere was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of\ncards in her hands. ‘Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, Arkady\nIvanovitch?’ She was a great hand at telling fortunes. I shall never\nforgive myself for not asking her to. I ran away in a fright, and,\nbesides, the bell rang. I was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a\nmiserable dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sudden\nMarfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart in a new green silk dress\nwith a long train. ‘Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch! How do you like my\ndress? Aniska can’t make like this.’ (Aniska was a dressmaker in the\ncountry, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a\npretty wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the dress,\nand then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. ‘I wonder\nyou trouble to come to me about such trifles, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘Good\ngracious, you won’t let one disturb you about anything!’ To tease her\nI said, ‘I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘That’s just like you,\nArkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a\nbride when you’ve hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a good\nchoice, at least, but I know it won’t be for your happiness or hers, you\nwill only be a laughing-stock to all good people.’ Then she went out and\nher train seemed to rustle. Isn’t it nonsense, eh?”\n\n“But perhaps you are telling lies?” Raskolnikov put in.\n\n“I rarely lie,” answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, apparently not\nnoticing the rudeness of the question.\n\n“And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?”\n\n“Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six years ago. I had\na serf, Filka; just after his burial I called out forgetting ‘Filka, my\npipe!’ He came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were. I sat\nstill and thought ‘he is doing it out of revenge,’ because we had a\nviolent quarrel just before his death. ‘How dare you come in with a hole\nin your elbow?’ I said. ‘Go away, you scamp!’ He turned and went out,\nand never came again. I didn’t tell Marfa Petrovna at the time. I wanted\nto have a service sung for him, but I was ashamed.”\n\n“You should go to a doctor.”\n\n“I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I don’t know\nwhat’s wrong; I believe I am five times as strong as you are. I didn’t\nask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen, but whether you\nbelieve that they exist.”\n\n“No, I won’t believe it!” Raskolnikov cried, with positive anger.\n\n“What do people generally say?” muttered Svidrigaïlov, as though\nspeaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his head. “They say, ‘You\nare ill, so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy.’ But that’s not\nstrictly logical. I agree that ghosts only appear to the sick, but that\nonly proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick, not that\nthey don’t exist.”\n\n“Nothing of the sort,” Raskolnikov insisted irritably.\n\n“No? You don’t think so?” Svidrigaïlov went on, looking at him\ndeliberately. “But what do you say to this argument (help me with\nit): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and fragments of other worlds, the\nbeginning of them. A man in health has, of course, no reason to see\nthem, because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the\nsake of completeness and order to live only in this life. But as soon\nas one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is\nbroken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the\nmore seriously ill one is, the closer becomes one’s contact with that\nother world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that\nworld. I thought of that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you\ncould believe in that, too.”\n\n“I don’t believe in a future life,” said Raskolnikov.\n\nSvidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.\n\n“And what if there are only spiders there, or something of that sort,”\n he said suddenly.\n\n“He is a madman,” thought Raskolnikov.\n\n“We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception,\nsomething vast, vast! But why must it be vast? Instead of all that, what\nif it’s one little room, like a bath house in the country, black\nand grimy and spiders in every corner, and that’s all eternity is? I\nsometimes fancy it like that.”\n\n“Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than\nthat?” Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish.\n\n“Juster? And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and do you know\nit’s what I would certainly have made it,” answered Svidrigaïlov, with a\nvague smile.\n\nThis horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov. Svidrigaïlov\nraised his head, looked at him, and suddenly began laughing.\n\n“Only think,” he cried, “half an hour ago we had never seen each other,\nwe regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled between\nus; we’ve thrown it aside, and away we’ve gone into the abstract! Wasn’t\nI right in saying that we were birds of a feather?”\n\n“Kindly allow me,” Raskolnikov went on irritably, “to ask you to explain\nwhy you have honoured me with your visit... and... and I am in a hurry,\nI have no time to waste. I want to go out.”\n\n“By all means, by all means. Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is going to\nbe married to Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr Petrovitch?”\n\n“Can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning\nher name? I can’t understand how you dare utter her name in my presence,\nif you really are Svidrigaïlov.”\n\n“Why, but I’ve come here to speak about her; how can I avoid mentioning\nher?”\n\n“Very good, speak, but make haste.”\n\n“I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this Mr.\nLuzhin, who is a connection of mine through my wife, if you have only\nseen him for half an hour, or heard any facts about him. He is no\nmatch for Avdotya Romanovna. I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing\nherself generously and imprudently for the sake of... for the sake of\nher family. I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be very\nglad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly\nadvantages. Now I know you personally, I am convinced of it.”\n\n“All this is very naïve... excuse me, I should have said impudent on\nyour part,” said Raskolnikov.\n\n“You mean to say that I am seeking my own ends. Don’t be uneasy, Rodion\nRomanovitch, if I were working for my own advantage, I would not have\nspoken out so directly. I am not quite a fool. I will confess something\npsychologically curious about that: just now, defending my love for\nAvdotya Romanovna, I said I was myself the victim. Well, let me tell you\nthat I’ve no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that I wonder\nmyself indeed, for I really did feel something...”\n\n“Through idleness and depravity,” Raskolnikov put in.\n\n“I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualities\nthat even I could not help being impressed by them. But that’s all\nnonsense, as I see myself now.”\n\n“Have you seen that long?”\n\n“I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly sure of it the\nday before yesterday, almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg. I\nstill fancied in Moscow, though, that I was coming to try to get Avdotya\nRomanovna’s hand and to cut out Mr. Luzhin.”\n\n“Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and come to the object\nof your visit. I am in a hurry, I want to go out...”\n\n“With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and determining on a\ncertain... journey, I should like to make some necessary preliminary\narrangements. I left my children with an aunt; they are well provided\nfor; and they have no need of me personally. And a nice father I should\nmake, too! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year\nago. That’s enough for me. Excuse me, I am just coming to the point.\nBefore the journey which may come off, I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too.\nIt’s not that I detest him so much, but it was through him I quarrelled\nwith Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this marriage.\nI want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation, and if you\nlike in your presence, to explain to her that in the first place she\nwill never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, begging\nher pardon for all past unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten\nthousand roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture to\nwhich I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could see the way\nto it.”\n\n“You are certainly mad,” cried Raskolnikov not so much angered as\nastonished. “How dare you talk like that!”\n\n“I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, though I am not\nrich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free; I have absolutely no\nneed for it. If Avdotya Romanovna does not accept it, I shall waste\nit in some more foolish way. That’s the first thing. Secondly, my\nconscience is perfectly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive.\nYou may not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will\nknow. The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, whom I\ngreatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, and so, sincerely\nregretting it, I want--not to compensate, not to repay her for the\nunpleasantness, but simply to do something to her advantage, to show\nthat I am not, after all, privileged to do nothing but harm. If there\nwere a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not\nhave made it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thousand\nonly, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I may, perhaps,\nvery soon marry a young lady, and that alone ought to prevent suspicion\nof any design on Avdotya Romanovna. In conclusion, let me say that\nin marrying Mr. Luzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from\nanother man. Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it over coolly\nand quietly.”\n\nSvidrigaïlov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was saying\nthis.\n\n“I beg you to say no more,” said Raskolnikov. “In any case this is\nunpardonable impertinence.”\n\n“Not in the least. Then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbour\nin this world, and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good\nby trivial conventional formalities. That’s absurd. If I died, for\ninstance, and left that sum to your sister in my will, surely she\nwouldn’t refuse it?”\n\n“Very likely she would.”\n\n“Oh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be it, though ten\nthousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion. In any case I\nbeg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya Romanovna.”\n\n“No, I won’t.”\n\n“In that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to try and see her\nmyself and worry her by doing so.”\n\n“And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?”\n\n“I don’t know really what to say. I should like very much to see her\nonce more.”\n\n“Don’t hope for it.”\n\n“I’m sorry. But you don’t know me. Perhaps we may become better\nfriends.”\n\n“You think we may become friends?”\n\n“And why not?” Svidrigaïlov said, smiling. He stood up and took his hat.\n“I didn’t quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoning\non it... though I was very much struck by your face this morning.”\n\n“Where did you see me this morning?” Raskolnikov asked uneasily.\n\n“I saw you by chance.... I kept fancying there is something about you\nlike me.... But don’t be uneasy. I am not intrusive; I used to get on\nall right with card-sharpers, and I never bored Prince Svirbey, a great\npersonage who is a distant relation of mine, and I could write about\nRaphael’s _Madonna_ in Madam Prilukov’s album, and I never left Marfa\nPetrovna’s side for seven years, and I used to stay the night at\nViazemsky’s house in the Hay Market in the old days, and I may go up in\na balloon with Berg, perhaps.”\n\n“Oh, all right. Are you starting soon on your travels, may I ask?”\n\n“What travels?”\n\n“Why, on that ‘journey’; you spoke of it yourself.”\n\n“A journey? Oh, yes. I did speak of a journey. Well, that’s a wide\nsubject.... if only you knew what you are asking,” he added, and gave\na sudden, loud, short laugh. “Perhaps I’ll get married instead of the\njourney. They’re making a match for me.”\n\n“Here?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“How have you had time for that?”\n\n“But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once. I earnestly beg\nit. Well, good-bye for the present. Oh, yes. I have forgotten something.\nTell your sister, Rodion Romanovitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered\nher in her will and left her three thousand roubles. That’s absolutely\ncertain. Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death, and it was\ndone in my presence. Avdotya Romanovna will be able to receive the money\nin two or three weeks.”\n\n“Are you telling the truth?”\n\n“Yes, tell her. Well, your servant. I am staying very near you.”\n\nAs he went out, Svidrigaïlov ran up against Razumihin in the doorway.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIt was nearly eight o’clock. The two young men hurried to Bakaleyev’s,\nto arrive before Luzhin.\n\n“Why, who was that?” asked Razumihin, as soon as they were in the\nstreet.\n\n“It was Svidrigaïlov, that landowner in whose house my sister was\ninsulted when she was their governess. Through his persecuting her with\nhis attentions, she was turned out by his wife, Marfa Petrovna. This\nMarfa Petrovna begged Dounia’s forgiveness afterwards, and she’s just\ndied suddenly. It was of her we were talking this morning. I don’t\nknow why I’m afraid of that man. He came here at once after his wife’s\nfuneral. He is very strange, and is determined on doing something.... We\nmust guard Dounia from him... that’s what I wanted to tell you, do you\nhear?”\n\n“Guard her! What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanovna? Thank you, Rodya,\nfor speaking to me like that.... We will, we will guard her. Where does\nhe live?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Why didn’t you ask? What a pity! I’ll find out, though.”\n\n“Did you see him?” asked Raskolnikov after a pause.\n\n“Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well.”\n\n“You did really see him? You saw him clearly?” Raskolnikov insisted.\n\n“Yes, I remember him perfectly, I should know him in a thousand; I have\na good memory for faces.”\n\nThey were silent again.\n\n“Hm!... that’s all right,” muttered Raskolnikov. “Do you know, I\nfancied... I keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination.”\n\n“What do you mean? I don’t understand you.”\n\n“Well, you all say,” Raskolnikov went on, twisting his mouth into a\nsmile, “that I am mad. I thought just now that perhaps I really am mad,\nand have only seen a phantom.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Why, who can tell? Perhaps I am really mad, and perhaps everything that\nhappened all these days may be only imagination.”\n\n“Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again!... But what did he say, what did\nhe come for?”\n\nRaskolnikov did not answer. Razumihin thought a minute.\n\n“Now let me tell you my story,” he began, “I came to you, you were\nasleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfiry’s, Zametov was\nstill with him. I tried to begin, but it was no use. I couldn’t speak in\nthe right way. They don’t seem to understand and can’t understand, but\nare not a bit ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking\nto him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. At\nlast I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I’d\nbrain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed and came away. That was\nall. It was very stupid. To Zametov I didn’t say a word. But, you see, I\nthought I’d made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea\nstruck me: why should we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger\nor anything, but why need you care? You needn’t care a hang for them. We\nshall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I’d\nmystify them more than ever. How ashamed they’ll be afterwards! Hang\nthem! We can thrash them afterwards, but let’s laugh at them now!”\n\n“To be sure,” answered Raskolnikov. “But what will you say to-morrow?”\n he thought to himself. Strange to say, till that moment it had never\noccurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew. As he\nthought it, Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin’s account of his visit\nto Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had come and gone\nsince then.\n\nIn the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived punctually\nat eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went in\ntogether without greeting or looking at one another. The young men\nwalked in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a\nlittle in the passage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came\nforward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her\nbrother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though with\nredoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies. He looked, however, as though\nhe were a little put out and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to make\nthem all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling. Dounia\nand Luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table.\nRazumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin\nwas next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.\n\nA moment’s silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a\ncambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of\na benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to\ninsist on an explanation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to\nkeep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharp\nand emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position.\nBut he could not bring himself to do this. Besides, he could not endure\nuncertainty, and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been so\nopenly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it was\nbetter to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them and\nthere would always be time for that.\n\n“I trust you had a favourable journey,” he inquired officially of\nPulcheria Alexandrovna.\n\n“Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch.”\n\n“I am gratified to hear it. And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatigued\neither?”\n\n“I am young and strong, I don’t get tired, but it was a great strain for\nmother,” answered Dounia.\n\n“That’s unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible length.\n‘Mother Russia,’ as they say, is a vast country.... In spite of all my\ndesire to do so, I was unable to meet you yesterday. But I trust all\npassed off without inconvenience?”\n\n“Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheartening,” Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation, “and if\nDmitri Prokofitch had not been sent us, I really believe by God Himself,\nwe should have been utterly lost. Here, he is! Dmitri Prokofitch\nRazumihin,” she added, introducing him to Luzhin.\n\n“I had the pleasure... yesterday,” muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a\nhostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent.\n\nPyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface very\npolite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who,\ndirectly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, and\nbecome more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society.\nAgain all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya\nRomanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon. Razumihin had\nnothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again.\n\n“Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?” she began having recourse to\nher leading item of conversation.\n\n“To be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, and I have come to\nmake you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov\nset off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wife’s funeral. So\nat least I have excellent authority for believing.”\n\n“To Petersburg? here?” Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother.\n\n“Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view the\nrapidity of his departure, and all the circumstances preceding it.”\n\n“Good heavens! won’t he leave Dounia in peace even here?” cried\nPulcheria Alexandrovna.\n\n“I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds for\nuneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting\ninto communication with him. For my part I am on my guard, and am now\ndiscovering where he is lodging.”\n\n“Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you have\ngiven me,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: “I’ve only seen him twice,\nbut I thought him terrible, terrible! I am convinced that he was the\ncause of Marfa Petrovna’s death.”\n\n“It’s impossible to be certain about that. I have precise information. I\ndo not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of\nevents by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to the\ngeneral conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, I am\nin agreement with you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and\nprecisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me within\na very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he has any\npecuniary resources, he will relapse at once into his old ways. He is\nthe most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men.\nI have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so\nunfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years\nago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely by her exertions\nand sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic\nand homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to\nSiberia, was hushed up. That’s the sort of man he is, if you care to\nknow.”\n\n“Good heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskolnikov listened\nattentively.\n\n“Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of\nthis?” Dounia asked sternly and emphatically.\n\n“I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. I must\nobserve that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.\nThere was, and I believe still is, living here a woman called Resslich,\na foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did other\ncommissions, and with this woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close\nand mysterious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, living\nwith her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more than\nfourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged her every crust; she\nused to beat her mercilessly. One day the girl was found hanging in\nthe garret. At the inquest the verdict was suicide. After the usual\nproceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given that\nthe child had been... cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov. It is true, this\nwas not clearly established, the information was given by another German\nwoman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement\nwas actually made to the police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna’s money and\nexertions; it did not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very\nsignificant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you were\nwith them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he\nreceived six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom.”\n\n“I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself.”\n\n“Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him,\nto suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr.\nSvidrigaïlov.”\n\n“I don’t know that,” answered Dounia, dryly. “I only heard a queer story\nthat Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher,\nthe servants used to say, ‘he read himself silly,’ and that he hanged\nhimself partly on account of Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s mockery of him and not\nhis blows. When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they\nwere actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him for\nPhilip’s death.”\n\n“I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake his\ndefence all of a sudden,” Luzhin observed, twisting his lips into\nan ambiguous smile, “there’s no doubt that he is an astute man, and\ninsinuating where ladies are concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has\ndied so strangely, is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to be\nof service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewed\nefforts which may certainly be anticipated from him. For my part it’s\nmy firm conviction, that he will end in a debtor’s prison again.\nMarfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything\nsubstantial on him, having regard for his children’s interests, and,\nif she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency,\nsomething insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a\nman of his habits.”\n\n“Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you,” said Dounia, “say no more of Mr.\nSvidrigaïlov. It makes me miserable.”\n\n“He has just been to see me,” said Raskolnikov, breaking his silence for\nthe first time.\n\nThere were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him. Even Pyotr\nPetrovitch was roused.\n\n“An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, waked me, and\nintroduced himself,” Raskolnikov continued. “He was fairly cheerful\nand at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends. He is\nparticularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, at\nwhich he asked me to assist. He has a proposition to make to you, and\nhe told me about it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa\nPetrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dounia, and that\nyou can receive the money very shortly.”\n\n“Thank God!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself. “Pray for\nher soul, Dounia!”\n\n“It’s a fact!” broke from Luzhin.\n\n“Tell us, what more?” Dounia urged Raskolnikov.\n\n“Then he said that he wasn’t rich and all the estate was left to his\nchildren who are now with an aunt, then that he was staying somewhere\nnot far from me, but where, I don’t know, I didn’t ask....”\n\n“But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?” cried Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna in a fright. “Did he tell you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What was it?”\n\n“I’ll tell you afterwards.”\n\nRaskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea.\n\nPyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.\n\n“I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I shall not be in\nyour way,” he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up.\n\n“Don’t go, Pyotr Petrovitch,” said Dounia, “you intended to spend\nthe evening. Besides, you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an\nexplanation with mother.”\n\n“Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna,” Pyotr Petrovitch answered\nimpressively, sitting down again, but still holding his hat. “I\ncertainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon\na very important point indeed. But as your brother cannot speak openly\nin my presence of some proposals of Mr. Svidrigaïlov, I, too, do not\ndesire and am not able to speak openly... in the presence of others...\nof certain matters of the greatest gravity. Moreover, my most weighty\nand urgent request has been disregarded....”\n\nAssuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence.\n\n“Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was\ndisregarded solely at my insistance,” said Dounia. “You wrote that you\nhad been insulted by my brother; I think that this must be explained at\nonce, and you must be reconciled. And if Rodya really has insulted you,\nthen he _should_ and _will_ apologise.”\n\nPyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line.\n\n“There are insults, Avdotya Romanovna, which no goodwill can make us\nforget. There is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep;\nand when it has been overstepped, there is no return.”\n\n“That wasn’t what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petrovitch,” Dounia\ninterrupted with some impatience. “Please understand that our whole\nfuture depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as\nsoon as possible. I tell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at\nit in any other light, and if you have the least regard for me, all this\nbusiness must be ended to-day, however hard that may be. I repeat that\nif my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness.”\n\n“I am surprised at your putting the question like that,” said Luzhin,\ngetting more and more irritated. “Esteeming, and so to say, adoring you,\nI may at the same time, very well indeed, be able to dislike some member\nof your family. Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, I\ncannot accept duties incompatible with...”\n\n“Ah, don’t be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch,” Dounia\ninterrupted with feeling, “and be the sensible and generous man I have\nalways considered, and wish to consider, you to be. I’ve given you a\ngreat promise, I am your betrothed. Trust me in this matter and, believe\nme, I shall be capable of judging impartially. My assuming the part of\njudge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you. When I insisted\non his coming to our interview to-day after your letter, I told\nhim nothing of what I meant to do. Understand that, if you are not\nreconciled, I must choose between you--it must be either you or he. That\nis how the question rests on your side and on his. I don’t want to be\nmistaken in my choice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break off\nwith my brother, for my brother’s sake I must break off with you. I can\nfind out for certain now whether he is a brother to me, and I want to\nknow it; and of you, whether I am dear to you, whether you esteem me,\nwhether you are the husband for me.”\n\n“Avdotya Romanovna,” Luzhin declared huffily, “your words are of too\nmuch consequence to me; I will say more, they are offensive in view\nof the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you. To say\nnothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an\nimpertinent boy, you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to\nme. You say ‘you or he,’ showing thereby of how little consequence I\nam in your eyes... I cannot let this pass considering the relationship\nand... the obligations existing between us.”\n\n“What!” cried Dounia, flushing. “I set your interest beside all that has\nhitherto been most precious in my life, what has made up the _whole_ of\nmy life, and here you are offended at my making too _little_ account of\nyou.”\n\nRaskolnikov smiled sarcastically, Razumihin fidgeted, but Pyotr\nPetrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the contrary, at every word he\nbecame more persistent and irritable, as though he relished it.\n\n“Love for the future partner of your life, for your husband, ought to\noutweigh your love for your brother,” he pronounced sententiously, “and\nin any case I cannot be put on the same level.... Although I said so\nemphatically that I would not speak openly in your brother’s presence,\nnevertheless, I intend now to ask your honoured mother for a necessary\nexplanation on a point of great importance closely affecting my dignity.\nYour son,” he turned to Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “yesterday in the\npresence of Mr. Razsudkin (or... I think that’s it? excuse me I have\nforgotten your surname,” he bowed politely to Razumihin) “insulted me by\nmisrepresenting the idea I expressed to you in a private conversation,\ndrinking coffee, that is, that marriage with a poor girl who has had\nexperience of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal point of\nview than with one who has lived in luxury, since it is more profitable\nfor the moral character. Your son intentionally exaggerated the\nsignificance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing me of\nmalicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied upon your\ncorrespondence with him. I shall consider myself happy, Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna, if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite\nconclusion, and thereby considerately reassure me. Kindly let me know\nin what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to Rodion\nRomanovitch.”\n\n“I don’t remember,” faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna. “I repeated them as\nI understood them. I don’t know how Rodya repeated them to you, perhaps\nhe exaggerated.”\n\n“He could not have exaggerated them, except at your instigation.”\n\n“Pyotr Petrovitch,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared with dignity, “the\nproof that Dounia and I did not take your words in a very bad sense is\nthe fact that we are here.”\n\n“Good, mother,” said Dounia approvingly.\n\n“Then this is my fault again,” said Luzhin, aggrieved.\n\n“Well, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but you yourself have\njust written what was false about him,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna added,\ngaining courage.\n\n“I don’t remember writing anything false.”\n\n“You wrote,” Raskolnikov said sharply, not turning to Luzhin, “that I\ngave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed, as was\nthe fact, but to his daughter (whom I had never seen till yesterday).\nYou wrote this to make dissension between me and my family, and for that\nobject added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom you\ndon’t know. All that is mean slander.”\n\n“Excuse me, sir,” said Luzhin, quivering with fury. “I enlarged upon\nyour qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to your\nsister’s and mother’s inquiries, how I found you, and what impression\nyou made on me. As for what you’ve alluded to in my letter, be so good\nas to point out one word of falsehood, show, that is, that you didn’t\nthrow away your money, and that there are not worthless persons in that\nfamily, however unfortunate.”\n\n“To my thinking, you, with all your virtues, are not worth the little\nfinger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones.”\n\n“Would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and\nsister?”\n\n“I have done so already, if you care to know. I made her sit down to-day\nwith mother and Dounia.”\n\n“Rodya!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Dounia crimsoned, Razumihin\nknitted his brows. Luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm.\n\n“You may see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna,” he said, “whether it is\npossible for us to agree. I hope now that this question is at an end,\nonce and for all. I will withdraw, that I may not hinder the pleasures\nof family intimacy, and the discussion of secrets.” He got up from his\nchair and took his hat. “But in withdrawing, I venture to request\nthat for the future I may be spared similar meetings, and, so to\nsay, compromises. I appeal particularly to you, honoured Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna, on this subject, the more as my letter was addressed to\nyou and to no one else.”\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended.\n\n“You seem to think we are completely under your authority, Pyotr\nPetrovitch. Dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded,\nshe had the best intentions. And indeed you write as though you were\nlaying commands upon me. Are we to consider every desire of yours as\na command? Let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show\nparticular delicacy and consideration for us now, because we have thrown\nup everything, and have come here relying on you, and so we are in any\ncase in a sense in your hands.”\n\n“That is not quite true, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, especially at the\npresent moment, when the news has come of Marfa Petrovna’s legacy, which\nseems indeed very apropos, judging from the new tone you take to me,” he\nadded sarcastically.\n\n“Judging from that remark, we may certainly presume that you were\nreckoning on our helplessness,” Dounia observed irritably.\n\n“But now in any case I cannot reckon on it, and I particularly desire\nnot to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of Arkady\nIvanovitch Svidrigaïlov, which he has entrusted to your brother and\nwhich have, I perceive, a great and possibly a very agreeable interest\nfor you.”\n\n“Good heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\n\nRazumihin could not sit still on his chair.\n\n“Aren’t you ashamed now, sister?” asked Raskolnikov.\n\n“I am ashamed, Rodya,” said Dounia. “Pyotr Petrovitch, go away,” she\nturned to him, white with anger.\n\nPyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion.\nHe had too much confidence in himself, in his power and in the\nhelplessness of his victims. He could not believe it even now. He turned\npale, and his lips quivered.\n\n“Avdotya Romanovna, if I go out of this door now, after such a\ndismissal, then, you may reckon on it, I will never come back. Consider\nwhat you are doing. My word is not to be shaken.”\n\n“What insolence!” cried Dounia, springing up from her seat. “I don’t\nwant you to come back again.”\n\n“What! So that’s how it stands!” cried Luzhin, utterly unable to the\nlast moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of\nhis reckoning now. “So that’s how it stands! But do you know, Avdotya\nRomanovna, that I might protest?”\n\n“What right have you to speak to her like that?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\nintervened hotly. “And what can you protest about? What rights have you?\nAm I to give my Dounia to a man like you? Go away, leave us altogether!\nWe are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action, and I above\nall....”\n\n“But you have bound me, Pulcheria Alexandrovna,” Luzhin stormed in a\nfrenzy, “by your promise, and now you deny it and... besides... I have\nbeen led on account of that into expenses....”\n\nThis last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petrovitch, that\nRaskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it,\ncould not help breaking into laughter. But Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\nfurious.\n\n“Expenses? What expenses? Are you speaking of our trunk? But the\nconductor brought it for nothing for you. Mercy on us, we have bound\nyou! What are you thinking about, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was you bound us,\nhand and foot, not we!”\n\n“Enough, mother, no more please,” Avdotya Romanovna implored. “Pyotr\nPetrovitch, do be kind and go!”\n\n“I am going, but one last word,” he said, quite unable to control\nhimself. “Your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that I made up my\nmind to take you, so to speak, after the gossip of the town had spread\nall over the district in regard to your reputation. Disregarding public\nopinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation, I certainly\nmight very well reckon on a fitting return, and might indeed look for\ngratitude on your part. And my eyes have only now been opened! I see\nmyself that I may have acted very, very recklessly in disregarding the\nuniversal verdict....”\n\n“Does the fellow want his head smashed?” cried Razumihin, jumping up.\n\n“You are a mean and spiteful man!” cried Dounia.\n\n“Not a word! Not a movement!” cried Raskolnikov, holding Razumihin back;\nthen going close up to Luzhin, “Kindly leave the room!” he said quietly\nand distinctly, “and not a word more or...”\n\nPyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that\nworked with anger, then he turned, went out, and rarely has any man\ncarried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against\nRaskolnikov. Him, and him alone, he blamed for everything. It is\nnoteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case\nwas perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were\nconcerned, all might “very well indeed” be set right again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such an\nending; he had been overbearing to the last degree, never dreaming that\ntwo destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control. This\nconviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to\nthe point of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up from\ninsignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, had the highest\nopinion of his intelligence and capacities, and sometimes even gloated\nin solitude over his image in the glass. But what he loved and valued\nabove all was the money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts\nof devices: that money made him the equal of all who had been his\nsuperiors.\n\nWhen he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had decided to take her in\nspite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity\nand had, indeed, felt genuinely indignant at such “black ingratitude.”\n And yet, when he made Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the\ngroundlessness of all the gossip. The story had been everywhere\ncontradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbelieved by all the\ntownspeople, who were warm in Dounia’a defence. And he would not have\ndenied that he knew all that at the time. Yet he still thought highly\nof his own resolution in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as\nsomething heroic. In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret\nfeeling he cherished and admired, and he could not understand that\nothers should fail to admire it too. He had called on Raskolnikov with\nthe feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good\ndeeds and to hear agreeable flattery. And as he went downstairs now, he\nconsidered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.\n\nDounia was simply essential to him; to do without her was unthinkable.\nFor many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he had\ngone on waiting and amassing money. He brooded with relish, in profound\nsecret, over the image of a girl--virtuous, poor (she must be poor),\nvery young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, one\nwho had suffered much, and was completely humbled before him, one who\nwould all her life look on him as her saviour, worship him, admire him\nand only him. How many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imagined\non this seductive and playful theme, when his work was over! And,\nbehold, the dream of so many years was all but realised; the beauty and\neducation of Avdotya Romanovna had impressed him; her helpless position\nhad been a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he\ndreamed of. Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of education\nand breeding superior to his own (he felt that), and this creature would\nbe slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension, and\nwould humble herself in the dust before him, and he would have absolute,\nunbounded power over her!... Not long before, he had, too, after long\nreflection and hesitation, made an important change in his career and\nwas now entering on a wider circle of business. With this change his\ncherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely\nto be realised.... He was, in fact, determined to try his fortune\nin Petersburg. He knew that women could do a very great deal. The\nfascination of a charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make\nhis way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to him, throwing\nan aureole round him, and now everything was in ruins! This sudden\nhorrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder; it was like a\nhideous joke, an absurdity. He had only been a tiny bit masterful,\nhad not even time to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried\naway--and it had ended so seriously. And, of course, too, he did love\nDounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his dreams--and all\nat once! No! The next day, the very next day, it must all be set right,\nsmoothed over, settled. Above all he must crush that conceited milksop\nwho was the cause of it all. With a sick feeling he could not help\nrecalling Razumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score;\nas though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him! The man\nhe really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov.... He had, in short, a\ngreat deal to attend to....\n\n*****\n\n“No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!” said Dounia, kissing and\nembracing her mother. “I was tempted by his money, but on my honour,\nbrother, I had no idea he was such a base man. If I had seen through him\nbefore, nothing would have tempted me! Don’t blame me, brother!”\n\n“God has delivered us! God has delivered us!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\nmuttered, but half consciously, as though scarcely able to realise what\nhad happened.\n\nThey were all relieved, and in five minutes they were laughing. Only now\nand then Dounia turned white and frowned, remembering what had passed.\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad:\nshe had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible\nmisfortune. Razumihin was delighted. He did not yet dare to express his\njoy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weight\nhad fallen off his heart. Now he had the right to devote his life to\nthem, to serve them.... Anything might happen now! But he felt afraid to\nthink of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination\nrange. But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and\nindifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of\nLuzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened. Dounia\ncould not help thinking that he was still angry with her, and Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna watched him timidly.\n\n“What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?” said Dounia, approaching him.\n\n“Yes, yes!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\n\nRaskolnikov raised his head.\n\n“He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desires\nto see you once in my presence.”\n\n“See her! On no account!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. “And how dare he\noffer her money!”\n\nThen Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversation with\nSvidrigaïlov, omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of Marfa\nPetrovna, wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk.\n\n“What answer did you give him?” asked Dounia.\n\n“At first I said I would not take any message to you. Then he said that\nhe would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help.\nHe assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation, now he\nhas no feeling for you. He doesn’t want you to marry Luzhin.... His talk\nwas altogether rather muddled.”\n\n“How do you explain him to yourself, Rodya? How did he strike you?”\n\n“I must confess I don’t quite understand him. He offers you ten\nthousand, and yet says he is not well off. He says he is going away, and\nin ten minutes he forgets he has said it. Then he says he is going to be\nmarried and has already fixed on the girl.... No doubt he has a motive,\nand probably a bad one. But it’s odd that he should be so clumsy about\nit if he had any designs against you.... Of course, I refused this\nmoney on your account, once for all. Altogether, I thought him very\nstrange.... One might almost think he was mad. But I may be mistaken;\nthat may only be the part he assumes. The death of Marfa Petrovna seems\nto have made a great impression on him.”\n\n“God rest her soul,” exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. “I shall always,\nalways pray for her! Where should we be now, Dounia, without this three\nthousand! It’s as though it had fallen from heaven! Why, Rodya, this\nmorning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were\njust planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from that man\nuntil he offered help.”\n\nDounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov’s offer. She still\nstood meditating.\n\n“He has got some terrible plan,” she said in a half whisper to herself,\nalmost shuddering.\n\nRaskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.\n\n“I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again,” he said to\nDounia.\n\n“We will watch him! I will track him out!” cried Razumihin, vigorously.\n“I won’t lose sight of him. Rodya has given me leave. He said to me\nhimself just now. ‘Take care of my sister.’ Will you give me leave, too,\nAvdotya Romanovna?”\n\nDounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of anxiety did not\nleave her face. Pulcheria Alexandrovna gazed at her timidly, but the\nthree thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a lively\nconversation. Even Raskolnikov listened attentively for some time,\nthough he did not talk. Razumihin was the speaker.\n\n“And why, why should you go away?” he flowed on ecstatically. “And what\nare you to do in a little town? The great thing is, you are all here\ntogether and you need one another--you do need one another, believe me.\nFor a time, anyway.... Take me into partnership, and I assure you we’ll\nplan a capital enterprise. Listen! I’ll explain it all in detail to\nyou, the whole project! It all flashed into my head this morning,\nbefore anything had happened... I tell you what; I have an uncle, I must\nintroduce him to you (a most accommodating and respectable old man).\nThis uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his\npension and has no need of that money. For the last two years he has\nbeen bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent.\ninterest. I know what that means; he simply wants to help me. Last year\nI had no need of it, but this year I resolved to borrow it as soon as\nhe arrived. Then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have\nenough for a start, so we’ll go into partnership, and what are we going\nto do?”\n\nThen Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he explained at length\nthat almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all\nof what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually bad\npublishers, and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give\na profit, sometimes a considerable one. Razumihin had, indeed, been\ndreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years he had\nbeen working in publishers’ offices, and knew three European languages\nwell, though he had told Raskolnikov six days before that he was\n“schwach” in German with an object of persuading him to take half his\ntranslation and half the payment for it. He had told a lie then, and\nRaskolnikov knew he was lying.\n\n“Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief\nmeans of success--money of our own!” cried Razumihin warmly. “Of course\nthere will be a lot of work, but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna,\nI, Rodion.... You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And\nthe great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants\ntranslating, and we shall be translating, publishing, learning all at\nonce. I can be of use because I have experience. For nearly two years\nI’ve been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every\ndetail of their business. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe\nme! And why, why should we let our chance slip! Why, I know--and I kept\nthe secret--two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles\nsimply for thinking of translating and publishing. Indeed, and I would\nnot take five hundred for the very idea of one of them. And what do you\nthink? If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say he’d hesitate--they are\nsuch blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling,\nyou trust to me, I know my way about. We’ll begin in a small way and go\non to a large. In any case it will get us our living and we shall get\nback our capital.”\n\nDounia’s eyes shone.\n\n“I like what you are saying, Dmitri Prokofitch!” she said.\n\n“I know nothing about it, of course,” put in Pulcheria Alexandrovna,\n“it may be a good idea, but again God knows. It’s new and untried. Of\ncourse, we must remain here at least for a time.” She looked at Rodya.\n\n“What do you think, brother?” said Dounia.\n\n“I think he’s got a very good idea,” he answered. “Of course, it’s too\nsoon to dream of a publishing firm, but we certainly might bring out\nfive or six books and be sure of success. I know of one book myself\nwhich would be sure to go well. And as for his being able to manage it,\nthere’s no doubt about that either. He knows the business.... But we can\ntalk it over later....”\n\n“Hurrah!” cried Razumihin. “Now, stay, there’s a flat here in this\nhouse, belonging to the same owner. It’s a special flat apart, not\ncommunicating with these lodgings. It’s furnished, rent moderate,\nthree rooms. Suppose you take them to begin with. I’ll pawn your watch\nto-morrow and bring you the money, and everything can be arranged then.\nYou can all three live together, and Rodya will be with you. But where\nare you off to, Rodya?”\n\n“What, Rodya, you are going already?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in\ndismay.\n\n“At such a minute?” cried Razumihin.\n\nDounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder. He held his cap in\nhis hand, he was preparing to leave them.\n\n“One would think you were burying me or saying good-bye for ever,” he\nsaid somewhat oddly. He attempted to smile, but it did not turn out a\nsmile. “But who knows, perhaps it is the last time we shall see each\nother...” he let slip accidentally. It was what he was thinking, and it\nsomehow was uttered aloud.\n\n“What is the matter with you?” cried his mother.\n\n“Where are you going, Rodya?” asked Dounia rather strangely.\n\n“Oh, I’m quite obliged to...” he answered vaguely, as though hesitating\nwhat he would say. But there was a look of sharp determination in his\nwhite face.\n\n“I meant to say... as I was coming here... I meant to tell you, mother,\nand you, Dounia, that it would be better for us to part for a time. I\nfeel ill, I am not at peace.... I will come afterwards, I will come of\nmyself... when it’s possible. I remember you and love you.... Leave me,\nleave me alone. I decided this even before... I’m absolutely resolved on\nit. Whatever may come to me, whether I come to ruin or not, I want to be\nalone. Forget me altogether, it’s better. Don’t inquire about me. When\nI can, I’ll come of myself or... I’ll send for you. Perhaps it will all\ncome back, but now if you love me, give me up... else I shall begin to\nhate you, I feel it.... Good-bye!”\n\n“Good God!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Both his mother and his sister\nwere terribly alarmed. Razumihin was also.\n\n“Rodya, Rodya, be reconciled with us! Let us be as before!” cried his\npoor mother.\n\nHe turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room. Dounia\novertook him.\n\n“Brother, what are you doing to mother?” she whispered, her eyes\nflashing with indignation.\n\nHe looked dully at her.\n\n“No matter, I shall come.... I’m coming,” he muttered in an undertone,\nas though not fully conscious of what he was saying, and he went out of\nthe room.\n\n“Wicked, heartless egoist!” cried Dounia.\n\n“He is insane, but not heartless. He is mad! Don’t you see it? You’re\nheartless after that!” Razumihin whispered in her ear, squeezing\nher hand tightly. “I shall be back directly,” he shouted to the\nhorror-stricken mother, and he ran out of the room.\n\nRaskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the passage.\n\n“I knew you would run after me,” he said. “Go back to them--be with\nthem... be with them to-morrow and always.... I... perhaps I shall\ncome... if I can. Good-bye.”\n\nAnd without holding out his hand he walked away.\n\n“But where are you going? What are you doing? What’s the matter with\nyou? How can you go on like this?” Razumihin muttered, at his wits’ end.\n\nRaskolnikov stopped once more.\n\n“Once for all, never ask me about anything. I have nothing to tell you.\nDon’t come to see me. Maybe I’ll come here.... Leave me, but _don’t\nleave_ them. Do you understand me?”\n\nIt was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the lamp. For a\nminute they were looking at one another in silence. Razumihin remembered\nthat minute all his life. Raskolnikov’s burning and intent eyes\ngrew more penetrating every moment, piercing into his soul, into his\nconsciousness. Suddenly Razumihin started. Something strange, as it\nwere, passed between them.... Some idea, some hint, as it were, slipped,\nsomething awful, hideous, and suddenly understood on both sides....\nRazumihin turned pale.\n\n“Do you understand now?” said Raskolnikov, his face twitching nervously.\n“Go back, go to them,” he said suddenly, and turning quickly, he went\nout of the house.\n\nI will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back to the ladies,\nhow he soothed them, how he protested that Rodya needed rest in his\nillness, protested that Rodya was sure to come, that he would come every\nday, that he was very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated,\nthat he, Razumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, the\nbest doctor, a consultation.... In fact from that evening Razumihin took\nhis place with them as a son and a brother.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nRaskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia\nlived. It was an old green house of three storeys. He found the\nporter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of\nKapernaumov, the tailor. Having found in the corner of the courtyard\nthe entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second\nfloor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey\nover the yard. While he was wandering in the darkness, uncertain where\nto turn for Kapernaumov’s door, a door opened three paces from him; he\nmechanically took hold of it.\n\n“Who is there?” a woman’s voice asked uneasily.\n\n“It’s I... come to see you,” answered Raskolnikov and he walked into the\ntiny entry.\n\nOn a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick.\n\n“It’s you! Good heavens!” cried Sonia weakly, and she stood rooted to\nthe spot.\n\n“Which is your room? This way?” and Raskolnikov, trying not to look at\nher, hastened in.\n\nA minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the\ncandlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressibly\nagitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit. The colour\nrushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes... She\nfelt sick and ashamed and happy, too.... Raskolnikov turned away quickly\nand sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the room in a rapid glance.\n\nIt was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the\nKapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.\nIn the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always\nkept locked. That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging.\nSonia’s room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and\nthis gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three windows looking\nout on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute\nangle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.\nThe other corner was disproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any\nfurniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead,\nbeside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table covered by a\nblue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other\nflat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. On the opposite\nwall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers\nlooking, as it were, lost in a desert. That was all there was in the\nroom. The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the\ncorners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter. There\nwas every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain.\n\nSonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively and\nunceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to tremble\nwith terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter\nof her destinies.\n\n“I am late.... It’s eleven, isn’t it?” he asked, still not lifting his\neyes.\n\n“Yes,” muttered Sonia, “oh yes, it is,” she added, hastily, as though in\nthat lay her means of escape. “My landlady’s clock has just struck... I\nheard it myself....”\n\n“I’ve come to you for the last time,” Raskolnikov went on gloomily,\nalthough this was the first time. “I may perhaps not see you again...”\n\n“Are you... going away?”\n\n“I don’t know... to-morrow....”\n\n“Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow?” Sonia’s voice\nshook.\n\n“I don’t know. I shall know to-morrow morning.... Never mind that: I’ve\ncome to say one word....”\n\nHe raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was\nsitting down while she was all the while standing before him.\n\n“Why are you standing? Sit down,” he said in a changed voice, gentle and\nfriendly.\n\nShe sat down. He looked kindly and almost compassionately at her.\n\n“How thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent, like a dead hand.”\n\nHe took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly.\n\n“I have always been like that,” she said.\n\n“Even when you lived at home?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Of course, you were,” he added abruptly and the expression of his face\nand the sound of his voice changed again suddenly.\n\nHe looked round him once more.\n\n“You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?”\n\n“Yes....”\n\n“They live there, through that door?”\n\n“Yes.... They have another room like this.”\n\n“All in one room?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I should be afraid in your room at night,” he observed gloomily.\n\n“They are very good people, very kind,” answered Sonia, who still seemed\nbewildered, “and all the furniture, everything... everything is theirs.\nAnd they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me.”\n\n“They all stammer, don’t they?”\n\n“Yes.... He stammers and he’s lame. And his wife, too.... It’s not\nexactly that she stammers, but she can’t speak plainly. She is a very\nkind woman. And he used to be a house serf. And there are seven\nchildren... and it’s only the eldest one that stammers and the others\nare simply ill... but they don’t stammer.... But where did you hear\nabout them?” she added with some surprise.\n\n“Your father told me, then. He told me all about you.... And how you\nwent out at six o’clock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna\nknelt down by your bed.”\n\nSonia was confused.\n\n“I fancied I saw him to-day,” she whispered hesitatingly.\n\n“Whom?”\n\n“Father. I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten\no’clock and he seemed to be walking in front. It looked just like him. I\nwanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna....”\n\n“You were walking in the streets?”\n\n“Yes,” Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion and\nlooking down.\n\n“Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?”\n\n“Oh no, what are you saying? No!” Sonia looked at him almost with\ndismay.\n\n“You love her, then?”\n\n“Love her? Of course!” said Sonia with plaintive emphasis, and she\nclasped her hands in distress. “Ah, you don’t.... If you only knew!\nYou see, she is quite like a child.... Her mind is quite unhinged, you\nsee... from sorrow. And how clever she used to be... how generous... how\nkind! Ah, you don’t understand, you don’t understand!”\n\nSonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands in excitement\nand distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in\nher eyes. It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, that\nshe was longing to speak, to champion, to express something. A sort\nof _insatiable_ compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in\nevery feature of her face.\n\n“Beat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if she did beat me,\nwhat then? What of it? You know nothing, nothing about it.... She is so\nunhappy... ah, how unhappy! And ill.... She is seeking righteousness,\nshe is pure. She has such faith that there must be righteousness\neverywhere and she expects it.... And if you were to torture her, she\nwouldn’t do wrong. She doesn’t see that it’s impossible for people to\nbe righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child, like a child. She is\ngood!”\n\n“And what will happen to you?”\n\nSonia looked at him inquiringly.\n\n“They are left on your hands, you see. They were all on your hands\nbefore, though.... And your father came to you to beg for drink. Well,\nhow will it be now?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Sonia articulated mournfully.\n\n“Will they stay there?”\n\n“I don’t know.... They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady,\nI hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them, and Katerina\nIvanovna says that she won’t stay another minute.”\n\n“How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?”\n\n“Oh, no, don’t talk like that.... We are one, we live like one.” Sonia\nwas agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other\nlittle bird were to be angry. “And what could she do? What, what could\nshe do?” she persisted, getting hot and excited. “And how she cried\nto-day! Her mind is unhinged, haven’t you noticed it? At one minute she\nis worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the\nlunch and all that.... Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood,\nweeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the\nwall, in despair. Then she will be comforted again. She builds all her\nhopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will\nborrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and\nset up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to\nsuperintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life. And she kisses\nand hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in\nher fancies! One can’t contradict her. And all the day long she has been\nwashing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room with\nher feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath. We went this\nmorning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are\nquite worn out. Only the money we’d reckoned wasn’t enough, not nearly\nenough. And she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste,\nyou don’t know. And there in the shop she burst out crying before the\nshopmen because she hadn’t enough.... Ah, it was sad to see her....”\n\n“Well, after that I can understand your living like this,” Raskolnikov\nsaid with a bitter smile.\n\n“And aren’t you sorry for them? Aren’t you sorry?” Sonia flew at him\nagain. “Why, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though you’d\nseen nothing of it, and if you’d seen everything, oh dear! And how\noften, how often I’ve brought her to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only\na week before his death. I was cruel! And how often I’ve done it! Ah,\nI’ve been wretched at the thought of it all day!”\n\nSonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it.\n\n“You were cruel?”\n\n“Yes, I--I. I went to see them,” she went on, weeping, “and father said,\n‘read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, here’s a book.’ He\nhad a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives\nthere, he always used to get hold of such funny books. And I said, ‘I\ncan’t stay,’ as I didn’t want to read, and I’d gone in chiefly to show\nKaterina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some\ncollars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. Katerina\nIvanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself\nin the glass and was delighted with them. ‘Make me a present of them,\nSonia,’ she said, ‘please do.’ ‘_Please do_,’ she said, she wanted them\nso much. And when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her old\nhappy days. She looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she\nhas no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasn’t had all these years!\nAnd she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, she’d sooner give\naway everything. And these she asked for, she liked them so much. And I\nwas sorry to give them. ‘What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?’ I\nsaid. I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that! She gave\nme such a look. And she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her.\nAnd it was so sad to see.... And she was not grieved for the collars,\nbut for my refusing, I saw that. Ah, if only I could bring it all back,\nchange it, take back those words! Ah, if I... but it’s nothing to you!”\n\n“Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?”\n\n“Yes.... Did you know her?” Sonia asked with some surprise.\n\n“Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she will soon\ndie,” said Raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her question.\n\n“Oh, no, no, no!”\n\nAnd Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as though imploring\nthat she should not.\n\n“But it will be better if she does die.”\n\n“No, not better, not at all better!” Sonia unconsciously repeated in\ndismay.\n\n“And the children? What can you do except take them to live with you?”\n\n“Oh, I don’t know,” cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she put her\nhands to her head.\n\nIt was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and\nhe had only roused it again.\n\n“And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, you get ill\nand are taken to the hospital, what will happen then?” he persisted\npitilessly.\n\n“How can you? That cannot be!”\n\nAnd Sonia’s face worked with awful terror.\n\n“Cannot be?” Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. “You are not\ninsured against it, are you? What will happen to them then? They will\nbe in the street, all of them, she will cough and beg and knock her head\nagainst some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry....\nThen she will fall down, be taken to the police station and to the\nhospital, she will die, and the children...”\n\n“Oh, no.... God will not let it be!” broke at last from Sonia’s\noverburdened bosom.\n\nShe listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her hands in dumb\nentreaty, as though it all depended upon him.\n\nRaskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A minute passed.\nSonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible\ndejection.\n\n“And can’t you save? Put by for a rainy day?” he asked, stopping\nsuddenly before her.\n\n“No,” whispered Sonia.\n\n“Of course not. Have you tried?” he added almost ironically.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And it didn’t come off! Of course not! No need to ask.”\n\nAnd again he paced the room. Another minute passed.\n\n“You don’t get money every day?”\n\nSonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again.\n\n“No,” she whispered with a painful effort.\n\n“It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt,” he said suddenly.\n\n“No, no! It can’t be, no!” Sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though\nshe had been stabbed. “God would not allow anything so awful!”\n\n“He lets others come to it.”\n\n“No, no! God will protect her, God!” she repeated beside herself.\n\n“But, perhaps, there is no God at all,” Raskolnikov answered with a sort\nof malignance, laughed and looked at her.\n\nSonia’s face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. She looked at\nhim with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not\nspeak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands.\n\n“You say Katerina Ivanovna’s mind is unhinged; your own mind is\nunhinged,” he said after a brief silence.\n\nFive minutes passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence, not\nlooking at her. At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He put\nhis two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful\nface. His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were\ntwitching. All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the\nground, kissed her foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And\ncertainly he looked like a madman.\n\n“What are you doing to me?” she muttered, turning pale, and a sudden\nanguish clutched at her heart.\n\nHe stood up at once.\n\n“I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of\nhumanity,” he said wildly and walked away to the window. “Listen,” he\nadded, turning to her a minute later. “I said just now to an insolent\nman that he was not worth your little finger... and that I did my sister\nhonour making her sit beside you.”\n\n“Ach, you said that to them! And in her presence?” cried Sonia,\nfrightened. “Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I’m... dishonourable....\nAh, why did you say that?”\n\n“It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you,\nbut because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner, that’s\ntrue,” he added almost solemnly, “and your worst sin is that you have\ndestroyed and betrayed yourself _for nothing_. Isn’t that fearful? Isn’t\nit fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at\nthe same time you know yourself (you’ve only to open your eyes) that you\nare not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything? Tell me,”\n he went on almost in a frenzy, “how this shame and degradation can exist\nin you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings? It would be\nbetter, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end\nit all!”\n\n“But what would become of them?” Sonia asked faintly, gazing at him with\neyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion.\n\nRaskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her face; so she\nmust have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly\nshe had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that\nnow she scarcely wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed\nthe cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and his\npeculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either,\nand that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw how monstrously the thought\nof her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long\ntortured her. “What, what,” he thought, “could hitherto have hindered\nher from putting an end to it?” Only then he realised what those poor\nlittle orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna,\nknocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia.\n\nBut, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and\nthe amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any\ncase remain so. He was still confronted by the question, how could she\nhave remained so long in that position without going out of her mind,\nsince she could not bring herself to jump into the water? Of course he\nknew that Sonia’s position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not\nunique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her\ntinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought,\nhave killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held her\nup--surely not depravity? All that infamy had obviously only touched\nher mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her\nheart; he saw that. He saw through her as she stood before him....\n\n“There are three ways before her,” he thought, “the canal, the madhouse,\nor... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns\nthe heart to stone.”\n\nThe last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he was\nyoung, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believing\nthat the last end was the most likely.\n\n“But can that be true?” he cried to himself. “Can that creature who has\nstill preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last\ninto that sink of filth and iniquity? Can the process already have\nbegun? Can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now,\nbecause vice has begun to be less loathsome to her? No, no, that cannot\nbe!” he cried, as Sonia had just before. “No, what has kept her from the\ncanal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children.... And if she\nhas not gone out of her mind... but who says she has not gone out of her\nmind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk, can one reason as she does?\nHow can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she\nis slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger? Does she\nexpect a miracle? No doubt she does. Doesn’t that all mean madness?”\n\nHe stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that explanation indeed\nbetter than any other. He began looking more intently at her.\n\n“So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?” he asked her.\n\nSonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer.\n\n“What should I be without God?” she whispered rapidly, forcibly,\nglancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and squeezing his hand.\n\n“Ah, so that is it!” he thought.\n\n“And what does God do for you?” he asked, probing her further.\n\nSonia was silent a long while, as though she could not answer. Her weak\nchest kept heaving with emotion.\n\n“Be silent! Don’t ask! You don’t deserve!” she cried suddenly, looking\nsternly and wrathfully at him.\n\n“That’s it, that’s it,” he repeated to himself.\n\n“He does everything,” she whispered quickly, looking down again.\n\n“That’s the way out! That’s the explanation,” he decided, scrutinising\nher with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling.\nHe gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft\nblue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that\nlittle body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed\nto him more and more strange, almost impossible. “She is a religious\nmaniac!” he repeated to himself.\n\nThere was a book lying on the chest of drawers. He had noticed it every\ntime he paced up and down the room. Now he took it up and looked at it.\nIt was the New Testament in the Russian translation. It was bound in\nleather, old and worn.\n\n“Where did you get that?” he called to her across the room.\n\nShe was still standing in the same place, three steps from the table.\n\n“It was brought me,” she answered, as it were unwillingly, not looking\nat him.\n\n“Who brought it?”\n\n“Lizaveta, I asked her for it.”\n\n“Lizaveta! strange!” he thought.\n\nEverything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every\nmoment. He carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the\npages.\n\n“Where is the story of Lazarus?” he asked suddenly.\n\nSonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer. She was\nstanding sideways to the table.\n\n“Where is the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me, Sonia.”\n\nShe stole a glance at him.\n\n“You are not looking in the right place.... It’s in the fourth gospel,”\n she whispered sternly, without looking at him.\n\n“Find it and read it to me,” he said. He sat down with his elbow on the\ntable, leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly, prepared to\nlisten.\n\n“In three weeks’ time they’ll welcome me in the madhouse! I shall be\nthere if I am not in a worse place,” he muttered to himself.\n\nSonia heard Raskolnikov’s request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly\nto the table. She took the book however.\n\n“Haven’t you read it?” she asked, looking up at him across the table.\n\nHer voice became sterner and sterner.\n\n“Long ago.... When I was at school. Read!”\n\n“And haven’t you heard it in church?”\n\n“I... haven’t been. Do you often go?”\n\n“N-no,” whispered Sonia.\n\nRaskolnikov smiled.\n\n“I understand.... And you won’t go to your father’s funeral to-morrow?”\n\n“Yes, I shall. I was at church last week, too... I had a requiem\nservice.”\n\n“For whom?”\n\n“For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe.”\n\nHis nerves were more and more strained. His head began to go round.\n\n“Were you friends with Lizaveta?”\n\n“Yes.... She was good... she used to come... not often... she\ncouldn’t.... We used to read together and... talk. She will see God.”\n\nThe last phrase sounded strange in his ears. And here was something new\nagain: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them--religious\nmaniacs.\n\n“I shall be a religious maniac myself soon! It’s infectious!”\n\n“Read!” he cried irritably and insistently.\n\nSonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hardly dared to read\nto him. He looked almost with exasperation at the “unhappy lunatic.”\n\n“What for? You don’t believe?...” she whispered softly and as it were\nbreathlessly.\n\n“Read! I want you to,” he persisted. “You used to read to Lizaveta.”\n\nSonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands were shaking, her\nvoice failed her. Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the\nfirst syllable.\n\n“Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany...” she forced\nherself at last to read, but at the third word her voice broke like an\noverstrained string. There was a catch in her breath.\n\nRaskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him\nand the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted on\nher doing so. He understood only too well how painful it was for her\nto betray and unveil all that was her _own_. He understood that these\nfeelings really were her _secret treasure_, which she had kept perhaps\nfor years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappy\nfather and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst of\nstarving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches. But at the same\ntime he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with\ndread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read\nto _him_ that he might hear it, and to read _now_ whatever might come of\nit!... He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion.\nShe mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on\nreading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth\nverse:\n\n“And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning\ntheir brother.\n\n“Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met\nHim: but Mary sat still in the house.\n\n“Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother\nhad not died.\n\n“But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give\nit Thee....”\n\nThen she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would\nquiver and break again.\n\n“Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again.\n\n“Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the\nresurrection, at the last day.\n\n“Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that\nbelieveth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live.\n\n“And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest\nthou this?\n\n“She saith unto Him,”\n\n(And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and forcibly as\nthough she were making a public confession of faith.)\n\n“Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God Which\nshould come into the world.”\n\nShe stopped and looked up quickly at him, but controlling herself went\non reading. Raskolnikov sat without moving, his elbows on the table and\nhis eyes turned away. She read to the thirty-second verse.\n\n“Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down at\nHis feet, saying unto Him, Lord if Thou hadst been here, my brother had\nnot died.\n\n“When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which\ncame with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled,\n\n“And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, Lord, come and\nsee.\n\n“Jesus wept.\n\n“Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him!\n\n“And some of them said, could not this Man which opened the eyes of the\nblind, have caused that even this man should not have died?”\n\nRaskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. Yes, he had known it!\nShe was trembling in a real physical fever. He had expected it. She was\ngetting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense\ntriumph came over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy\ngave it power. The lines danced before her eyes, but she knew what she\nwas reading by heart. At the last verse “Could not this Man which opened\nthe eyes of the blind...” dropping her voice she passionately reproduced\nthe doubt, the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who\nin another moment would fall at His feet as though struck by\nthunder, sobbing and believing.... “And _he, he_--too, is blinded and\nunbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will believe, yes, yes! At\nonce, now,” was what she was dreaming, and she was quivering with happy\nanticipation.\n\n“Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was a\ncave, and a stone lay upon it.\n\n“Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was\ndead, saith unto Him, Lord by this time he stinketh: for he hath been\ndead four days.”\n\nShe laid emphasis on the word _four_.\n\n“Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest\nbelieve, thou shouldest see the glory of God?\n\n“Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.\nAnd Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou\nhast heard Me.\n\n“And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people which\nstand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\n\n“And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come\nforth.\n\n“And he that was dead came forth.”\n\n(She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as though she were\nseeing it before her eyes.)\n\n“Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about\nwith a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him and let him go.\n\n“Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which\nJesus did believed on Him.”\n\nShe could read no more, closed the book and got up from her chair\nquickly.\n\n“That is all about the raising of Lazarus,” she whispered severely and\nabruptly, and turning away she stood motionless, not daring to raise\nher eyes to him. She still trembled feverishly. The candle-end was\nflickering out in the battered candlestick, dimly lighting up in the\npoverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely\nbeen reading together the eternal book. Five minutes or more passed.\n\n“I came to speak of something,” Raskolnikov said aloud, frowning. He got\nup and went to Sonia. She lifted her eyes to him in silence. His face\nwas particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in\nit.\n\n“I have abandoned my family to-day,” he said, “my mother and sister. I\nam not going to see them. I’ve broken with them completely.”\n\n“What for?” asked Sonia amazed. Her recent meeting with his mother and\nsister had left a great impression which she could not analyse. She\nheard his news almost with horror.\n\n“I have only you now,” he added. “Let us go together.... I’ve come to\nyou, we are both accursed, let us go our way together!”\n\nHis eyes glittered “as though he were mad,” Sonia thought, in her turn.\n\n“Go where?” she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back.\n\n“How do I know? I only know it’s the same road, I know that and nothing\nmore. It’s the same goal!”\n\nShe looked at him and understood nothing. She knew only that he was\nterribly, infinitely unhappy.\n\n“No one of them will understand, if you tell them, but I have\nunderstood. I need you, that is why I have come to you.”\n\n“I don’t understand,” whispered Sonia.\n\n“You’ll understand later. Haven’t you done the same? You, too, have\ntransgressed... have had the strength to transgress. You have laid\nhands on yourself, you have destroyed a life... _your own_ (it’s all the\nsame!). You might have lived in spirit and understanding, but you’ll\nend in the Hay Market.... But you won’t be able to stand it, and if\nyou remain alone you’ll go out of your mind like me. You are like a mad\ncreature already. So we must go together on the same road! Let us go!”\n\n“What for? What’s all this for?” said Sonia, strangely and violently\nagitated by his words.\n\n“What for? Because you can’t remain like this, that’s why! You must look\nthings straight in the face at last, and not weep like a child and cry\nthat God won’t allow it. What will happen, if you should really be taken\nto the hospital to-morrow? She is mad and in consumption, she’ll soon\ndie and the children? Do you mean to tell me Polenka won’t come to\ngrief? Haven’t you seen children here at the street corners sent out\nby their mothers to beg? I’ve found out where those mothers live and in\nwhat surroundings. Children can’t remain children there! At seven the\nchild is vicious and a thief. Yet children, you know, are the image of\nChrist: ‘theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.’ He bade us honour and love\nthem, they are the humanity of the future....”\n\n“What’s to be done, what’s to be done?” repeated Sonia, weeping\nhysterically and wringing her hands.\n\n“What’s to be done? Break what must be broken, once for all, that’s all,\nand take the suffering on oneself. What, you don’t understand? You’ll\nunderstand later.... Freedom and power, and above all, power! Over all\ntrembling creation and all the ant-heap!... That’s the goal, remember\nthat! That’s my farewell message. Perhaps it’s the last time I shall\nspeak to you. If I don’t come to-morrow, you’ll hear of it all, and then\nremember these words. And some day later on, in years to come, you’ll\nunderstand perhaps what they meant. If I come to-morrow, I’ll tell you\nwho killed Lizaveta.... Good-bye.”\n\nSonia started with terror.\n\n“Why, do you know who killed her?” she asked, chilled with horror,\nlooking wildly at him.\n\n“I know and will tell... you, only you. I have chosen you out. I’m not\ncoming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to tell you. I chose you\nout long ago to hear this, when your father talked of you and when\nLizaveta was alive, I thought of it. Good-bye, don’t shake hands.\nTo-morrow!”\n\nHe went out. Sonia gazed at him as at a madman. But she herself was like\none insane and felt it. Her head was going round.\n\n“Good heavens, how does he know who killed Lizaveta? What did those\nwords mean? It’s awful!” But at the same time _the idea_ did not enter\nher head, not for a moment! “Oh, he must be terribly unhappy!... He has\nabandoned his mother and sister.... What for? What has happened? And\nwhat had he in his mind? What did he say to her? He had kissed her foot\nand said... said (yes, he had said it clearly) that he could not live\nwithout her.... Oh, merciful heavens!”\n\nSonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. She jumped up from\ntime to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverish\nsleep and dreamt of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading\nthe gospel and him... him with pale face, with burning eyes... kissing\nher feet, weeping.\n\nOn the other side of the door on the right, which divided Sonia’s room\nfrom Madame Resslich’s flat, was a room which had long stood empty. A\ncard was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the\ncanal advertising it to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to the\nroom’s being uninhabited. But all that time Mr. Svidrigaïlov had been\nstanding, listening at the door of the empty room. When Raskolnikov went\nout he stood still, thought a moment, went on tiptoe to his own room\nwhich adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it\nto the door that led to Sonia’s room. The conversation had struck him\nas interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly enjoyed it--so much so\nthat he brought a chair that he might not in the future, to-morrow, for\ninstance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but\nmight listen in comfort.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nWhen next morning at eleven o’clock punctually Raskolnikov went into the\ndepartment of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in\nto Porfiry Petrovitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long:\nit was at least ten minutes before he was summoned. He had expected\nthat they would pounce upon him. But he stood in the waiting-room, and\npeople, who apparently had nothing to do with him, were continually\npassing to and fro before him. In the next room which looked like an\noffice, several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had\nno notion who or what Raskolnikov might be. He looked uneasily and\nsuspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard, some\nmysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape. But there was\nnothing of the sort: he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty\ndetails, then other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him.\nHe might go where he liked for them. The conviction grew stronger in him\nthat if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that phantom sprung out of the\nearth, had seen everything, they would not have let him stand and wait\nlike that. And would they have waited till he elected to appear at\neleven? Either the man had not yet given information, or... or simply\nhe knew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have seen anything?)\nand so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantom\nexaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination. This conjecture\nhad begun to grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his\nalarm and despair. Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh\nconflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling--and he felt a\nrush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at\nfacing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. What he dreaded above all was\nmeeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred\nand was afraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was such\nthat he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold and\narrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible,\nto watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained\nnerves. At that moment he was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.\n\nHe found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His study was a room\nneither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that\nstood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, a\nbookcase in the corner and several chairs--all government furniture,\nof polished yellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door,\nbeyond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikov’s entrance\nPorfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in\nand they remained alone. He met his visitor with an apparently genial\nand good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that\nRaskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had\nbeen thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret.\n\n“Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are... in our domain”... began Porfiry,\nholding out both hands to him. “Come, sit down, old man... or perhaps\nyou don’t like to be called ‘my dear fellow’ and ‘old man!’--_tout\ncourt_? Please don’t think it too familiar.... Here, on the sofa.”\n\nRaskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. “In our domain,”\n the apologies for familiarity, the French phrase _tout court_, were all\ncharacteristic signs.\n\n“He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me one--he drew it\nback in time,” struck him suspiciously. Both were watching each other,\nbut when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away.\n\n“I brought you this paper... about the watch. Here it is. Is it all\nright or shall I copy it again?”\n\n“What? A paper? Yes, yes, don’t be uneasy, it’s all right,” Porfiry\nPetrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had said it he took the\npaper and looked at it. “Yes, it’s all right. Nothing more is needed,”\n he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table.\n\nA minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the\ntable and put it on his bureau.\n\n“I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me...\nformally... about my acquaintance with the murdered woman?” Raskolnikov\nwas beginning again. “Why did I put in ‘I believe’” passed through\nhis mind in a flash. “Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ‘_I\nbelieve_’?” came in a second flash. And he suddenly felt that his\nuneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the\nfirst looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and that\nthis was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were quivering, his emotion was\nincreasing. “It’s bad, it’s bad! I shall say too much again.”\n\n“Yes, yes, yes! There’s no hurry, there’s no hurry,” muttered Porfiry\nPetrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim,\nas it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table,\nat one moment avoiding Raskolnikov’s suspicious glance, then again\nstanding still and looking him straight in the face.\n\nHis fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling\nfrom one side to the other and rebounding back.\n\n“We’ve plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? Here, a\ncigarette!” he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. “You know I am\nreceiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my\ngovernment quarters. But I am living outside for the time, I had to\nhave some repairs done here. It’s almost finished now.... Government\nquarters, you know, are a capital thing. Eh, what do you think?”\n\n“Yes, a capital thing,” answered Raskolnikov, looking at him almost\nironically.\n\n“A capital thing, a capital thing,” repeated Porfiry Petrovitch, as\nthough he had just thought of something quite different. “Yes, a capital\nthing,” he almost shouted at last, suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and\nstopping short two steps from him.\n\nThis stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the\nserious, brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor.\n\nBut this stirred Raskolnikov’s spleen more than ever and he could not\nresist an ironical and rather incautious challenge.\n\n“Tell me, please,” he asked suddenly, looking almost insolently at him\nand taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence. “I believe it’s a\nsort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition--for all investigating\nlawyers--to begin their attack from afar, with a trivial, or at least\nan irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man\nthey are cross-examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to\ngive him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question. Isn’t\nthat so? It’s a sacred tradition, mentioned, I fancy, in all the manuals\nof the art?”\n\n“Yes, yes.... Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke about government\nquarters... eh?”\n\nAnd as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked;\na good-humoured, crafty look passed over his face. The wrinkles on his\nforehead were smoothed out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened\nand he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all\nover and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter forced\nhimself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that he was laughing,\nbroke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson, Raskolnikov’s\nrepulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing, scowled and\nstared with hatred at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his\nintentionally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution on\nboth sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in\nhis visitor’s face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with\nwhich the visitor received it. The latter fact was very significant\nin Raskolnikov’s eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been\nembarrassed just before either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps\nfallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here\nunknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in\nanother moment would break upon him...\n\nHe went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat and took his\ncap.\n\n“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began resolutely, though with considerable\nirritation, “yesterday you expressed a desire that I should come to you\nfor some inquiries” (he laid special stress on the word “inquiries”). “I\nhave come and if you have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow\nme to withdraw. I have no time to spare.... I have to be at the funeral\nof that man who was run over, of whom you... know also,” he added,\nfeeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at\nhis anger. “I am sick of it all, do you hear? and have long been. It’s\npartly what made me ill. In short,” he shouted, feeling that the phrase\nabout his illness was still more out of place, “in short, kindly examine\nme or let me go, at once. And if you must examine me, do so in the\nproper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile,\ngood-bye, as we have evidently nothing to keep us now.”\n\n“Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I question you about?”\n cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone, instantly leaving off\nlaughing. “Please don’t disturb yourself,” he began fidgeting from place\nto place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down. “There’s no hurry,\nthere’s no hurry, it’s all nonsense. Oh, no, I’m very glad you’ve come\nto see me at last... I look upon you simply as a visitor. And as for\nmy confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion Romanovitch. Rodion\nRomanovitch? That is your name?... It’s my nerves, you tickled me\nso with your witty observation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with\nlaughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time.... I’m\noften afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or I\nshall think you are angry...”\n\nRaskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, still frowning\nangrily. He did sit down, but still held his cap.\n\n“I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion Romanovitch,”\n Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoiding\nhis visitor’s eyes. “You see, I’m a bachelor, a man of no consequence\nand not used to society; besides, I have nothing before me, I’m set, I’m\nrunning to seed and... and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in\nour Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, but\nrespect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour before\nthey can find a subject for conversation--they are dumb, they sit\nopposite each other and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects of\nconversation, ladies for instance... people in high society always have\ntheir subjects of conversation, _c’est de rigueur_, but people of the\nmiddle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tied\nand awkward. What is the reason of it? Whether it is the lack of public\ninterest, or whether it is we are so honest we don’t want to deceive one\nanother, I don’t know. What do you think? Do put down your cap, it\nlooks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable... I am so\ndelighted...”\n\nRaskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with\na serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of Porfiry\nPetrovitch. “Does he really want to distract my attention with his silly\nbabble?”\n\n“I can’t offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with a\nfriend?” Porfiry pattered on, “and you know all these official\nduties... please don’t mind my running up and down, excuse it, my dear\nfellow, I am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise is\nabsolutely indispensable for me. I’m always sitting and so glad to be\nmoving about for five minutes... I suffer from my sedentary life... I\nalways intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all ranks,\neven Privy Councillors, may be seen skipping gaily there; there you have\nit, modern science... yes, yes.... But as for my duties here, inquiries\nand all such formalities... you mentioned inquiries yourself just now...\nI assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for\nthe interrogator than for the interrogated.... You made the observation\nyourself just now very aptly and wittily.” (Raskolnikov had made no\nobservation of the kind.) “One gets into a muddle! A regular muddle! One\nkeeps harping on the same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform and\nwe shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And as for\nour legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thoroughly agree\nwith you. Every prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant, knows that\nthey begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happily\nput it) and then deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!--your felicitous\ncomparison, he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by ‘government\nquarters’... he-he! You are an ironical person. Come. I won’t go on! Ah,\nby the way, yes! One word leads to another. You spoke of formality just\nnow, apropos of the inquiry, you know. But what’s the use of formality?\nIn many cases it’s nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets\na good deal more out of it. One can always fall back on formality, allow\nme to assure you. And after all, what does it amount to? An examining\nlawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step. The work of\ninvestigation is, so to speak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!”\n\nPorfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment. He had simply babbled on\nuttering empty phrases, letting slip a few enigmatic words and again\nreverting to incoherence. He was almost running about the room, moving\nhis fat little legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his\nright hand behind his back, while with his left making gesticulations\nthat were extraordinarily incongruous with his words. Raskolnikov\nsuddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop\nfor a moment near the door, as though he were listening.\n\n“Is he expecting anything?”\n\n“You are certainly quite right about it,” Porfiry began gaily, looking\nwith extraordinary simplicity at Raskolnikov (which startled him and\ninstantly put him on his guard); “certainly quite right in laughing so\nwittily at our legal forms, he-he! Some of these elaborate psychological\nmethods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if one adheres\ntoo closely to the forms. Yes... I am talking of forms again. Well, if\nI recognise, or more strictly speaking, if I suspect someone or other to\nbe a criminal in any case entrusted to me... you’re reading for the law,\nof course, Rodion Romanovitch?”\n\n“Yes, I was...”\n\n“Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future--though don’t\nsuppose I should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish\nabout crime! No, I simply make bold to state it by way of fact, if I\ntook this man or that for a criminal, why, I ask, should I worry him\nprematurely, even though I had evidence against him? In one case I may\nbe bound, for instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in\nquite a different position, you know, so why shouldn’t I let him walk\nabout the town a bit? he-he-he! But I see you don’t quite understand, so\nI’ll give you a clearer example. If I put him in prison too soon, I\nmay very likely give him, so to speak, moral support, he-he! You’re\nlaughing?”\n\nRaskolnikov had no idea of laughing. He was sitting with compressed\nlips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petrovitch’s.\n\n“Yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men are so\ndifferent. You say ‘evidence’. Well, there may be evidence. But\nevidence, you know, can generally be taken two ways. I am an examining\nlawyer and a weak man, I confess it. I should like to make a proof, so\nto say, mathematically clear. I should like to make a chain of evidence\nsuch as twice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof!\nAnd if I shut him up too soon--even though I might be convinced _he_\nwas the man, I should very likely be depriving myself of the means of\ngetting further evidence against him. And how? By giving him, so to\nspeak, a definite position, I shall put him out of suspense and set his\nmind at rest, so that he will retreat into his shell. They say that at\nSevastopol, soon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright\nthat the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once. But when\nthey saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege, they were delighted,\nI am told and reassured, for the thing would drag on for two months at\nleast. You’re laughing, you don’t believe me again? Of course, you’re\nright, too. You’re right, you’re right. These are special cases, I\nadmit. But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, the\ngeneral case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended,\nfor which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at\nall, for the reason that every case, every crime, for instance, so soon\nas it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case and\nsometimes a case unlike any that’s gone before. Very comic cases of that\nsort sometimes occur. If I leave one man quite alone, if I don’t touch\nhim and don’t worry him, but let him know or at least suspect every\nmoment that I know all about it and am watching him day and night, and\nif he is in continual suspicion and terror, he’ll be bound to lose his\nhead. He’ll come of himself, or maybe do something which will make it as\nplain as twice two are four--it’s delightful. It may be so with a simple\npeasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on a\ncertain side, it’s a dead certainty. For, my dear fellow, it’s a very\nimportant matter to know on what side a man is cultivated. And then\nthere are nerves, there are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, they\nare all sick, nervous and irritable!... And then how they all suffer\nfrom spleen! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for us. And it’s\nno anxiety to me, his running about the town free! Let him, let him walk\nabout for a bit! I know well enough that I’ve caught him and that he\nwon’t escape me. Where could he escape to, he-he? Abroad, perhaps? A\nPole will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching\nand have taken measures. Will he escape into the depths of the country\nperhaps? But you know, peasants live there, real rude Russian peasants.\nA modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such\nstrangers as our peasants. He-he! But that’s all nonsense, and on\nthe surface. It’s not merely that he has nowhere to run to, he is\n_psychologically_ unable to escape me, he-he! What an expression!\nThrough a law of nature he can’t escape me if he had anywhere to go.\nHave you seen a butterfly round a candle? That’s how he will keep\ncircling and circling round me. Freedom will lose its attractions. He’ll\nbegin to brood, he’ll weave a tangle round himself, he’ll worry himself\nto death! What’s more he will provide me with a mathematical proof--if I\nonly give him long enough interval.... And he’ll keep circling round\nme, getting nearer and nearer and then--flop! He’ll fly straight into my\nmouth and I’ll swallow him, and that will be very amusing, he-he-he! You\ndon’t believe me?”\n\nRaskolnikov made no reply; he sat pale and motionless, still gazing with\nthe same intensity into Porfiry’s face.\n\n“It’s a lesson,” he thought, turning cold. “This is beyond the cat\nplaying with a mouse, like yesterday. He can’t be showing off his power\nwith no motive... prompting me; he is far too clever for that... he must\nhave another object. What is it? It’s all nonsense, my friend, you are\npretending, to scare me! You’ve no proofs and the man I saw had no\nreal existence. You simply want to make me lose my head, to work me up\nbeforehand and so to crush me. But you are wrong, you won’t do it! But\nwhy give me such a hint? Is he reckoning on my shattered nerves? No, my\nfriend, you are wrong, you won’t do it even though you have some trap\nfor me... let us see what you have in store for me.”\n\nAnd he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal. At times\nhe longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him. This anger was what he\ndreaded from the beginning. He felt that his parched lips were flecked\nwith foam, his heart was throbbing. But he was still determined not to\nspeak till the right moment. He realised that this was the best\npolicy in his position, because instead of saying too much he would be\nirritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too\nfreely. Anyhow, this was what he hoped for.\n\n“No, I see you don’t believe me, you think I am playing a harmless joke\non you,” Porfiry began again, getting more and more lively, chuckling\nat every instant and again pacing round the room. “And to be sure you’re\nright: God has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in\nother people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and I repeat it, excuse\nan old man, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a man still young, so to\nsay, in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything, like\nall young people. Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and\nthat’s for all the world like the old Austrian _Hof-kriegsrath_, as\nfar as I can judge of military matters, that is: on paper they’d beaten\nNapoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study they worked it\nall out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, General Mack surrendered\nwith all his army, he-he-he! I see, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you are\nlaughing at a civilian like me, taking examples out of military history!\nBut I can’t help it, it’s my weakness. I am fond of military science.\nAnd I’m ever so fond of reading all military histories. I’ve certainly\nmissed my proper career. I ought to have been in the army, upon my\nword I ought. I shouldn’t have been a Napoleon, but I might have been a\nmajor, he-he! Well, I’ll tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about\nthis _special case_, I mean: actual fact and a man’s temperament, my\ndear sir, are weighty matters and it’s astonishing how they sometimes\ndeceive the sharpest calculation! I--listen to an old man--am speaking\nseriously, Rodion Romanovitch” (as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who\nwas scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even\nhis voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) “Moreover, I’m\na candid man... am I a candid man or not? What do you say? I fancy I\nreally am: I tell you these things for nothing and don’t even expect a\nreward for it, he-he! Well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendid\nthing, it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation of\nlife, and what tricks it can play! So that it sometimes is hard for a\npoor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when he’s liable\nto be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a man after\nall! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal’s temperament, worse\nluck for him! But young people carried away by their own wit don’t think\nof that ‘when they overstep all obstacles,’ as you wittily and cleverly\nexpressed it yesterday. He will lie--that is, the man who is a _special\ncase_, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion;\nyou might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit, but at\nthe most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint. Of course\nthere may be illness and a stuffy room as well, but anyway! Anyway he’s\ngiven us the idea! He lied incomparably, but he didn’t reckon on his\ntemperament. That’s what betrays him! Another time he will be carried\naway by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, he\nwill turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness will\nbe _too natural_, too much like the real thing, again he has given us\nan idea! Though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will think\ndifferently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like\nthat at every step! He puts himself forward where he is not wanted,\nspeaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts of\nallegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks why didn’t you take me long\nago? he-he-he! And that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man,\nthe psychologist, the literary man. The temperament reflects everything\nlike a mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are you so\npale, Rodion Romanovitch? Is the room stuffy? Shall I open the window?”\n\n“Oh, don’t trouble, please,” cried Raskolnikov and he suddenly broke\ninto a laugh. “Please don’t trouble.”\n\nPorfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed.\nRaskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly checking his hysterical\nlaughter.\n\n“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began, speaking loudly and distinctly, though\nhis legs trembled and he could scarcely stand. “I see clearly at last\nthat you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister\nLizaveta. Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this. If you\nfind that you have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, then\nprosecute me, arrest me. But I will not let myself be jeered at to my\nface and worried...”\n\nHis lips trembled, his eyes glowed with fury and he could not restrain\nhis voice.\n\n“I won’t allow it!” he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table. “Do\nyou hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch? I won’t allow it.”\n\n“Good heavens! What does it mean?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, apparently\nquite frightened. “Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, what is the\nmatter with you?”\n\n“I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov shouted again.\n\n“Hush, my dear man! They’ll hear and come in. Just think, what could we\nsay to them?” Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in horror, bringing his face\nclose to Raskolnikov’s.\n\n“I won’t allow it, I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov repeated mechanically,\nbut he too spoke in a sudden whisper.\n\nPorfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window.\n\n“Some fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear fellow. You’re\nill!” and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a\ndecanter of water in the corner. “Come, drink a little,” he whispered,\nrushing up to him with the decanter. “It will be sure to do you good.”\n\nPorfiry Petrovitch’s alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov\nwas silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity. He did not take\nthe water, however.\n\n“Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you’ll drive yourself out of your\nmind, I assure you, ach, ach! Have some water, do drink a little.”\n\nHe forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it mechanically to\nhis lips, but set it on the table again with disgust.\n\n“Yes, you’ve had a little attack! You’ll bring back your illness again,\nmy dear fellow,” Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy,\nthough he still looked rather disconcerted. “Good heavens, you must\ntake more care of yourself! Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me\nyesterday--I know, I know, I’ve a nasty, ironical temper, but what they\nmade of it!... Good heavens, he came yesterday after you’d been. We\ndined and he talked and talked away, and I could only throw up my hands\nin despair! Did he come from you? But do sit down, for mercy’s sake, sit\ndown!”\n\n“No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he went,”\n Raskolnikov answered sharply.\n\n“You knew?”\n\n“I knew. What of it?”\n\n“Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than that about you;\nI know about everything. I know how you went _to take a flat_ at night\nwhen it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, so\nthat the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, I\nunderstand your state of mind at that time... but you’ll drive yourself\nmad like that, upon my word! You’ll lose your head! You’re full of\ngenerous indignation at the wrongs you’ve received, first from destiny,\nand then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing to\nanother to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, because\nyou are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. That’s so, isn’t\nit? I have guessed how you feel, haven’t I? Only in that way you’ll\nlose your head and Razumihin’s, too; he’s too _good_ a man for such\na position, you must know that. You are ill and he is good and your\nillness is infectious for him... I’ll tell you about it when you are\nmore yourself.... But do sit down, for goodness’ sake. Please rest, you\nlook shocking, do sit down.”\n\nRaskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was hot all over. In\namazement he listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who\nstill seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude.\nBut he did not believe a word he said, though he felt a strange\ninclination to believe. Porfiry’s unexpected words about the flat had\nutterly overwhelmed him. “How can it be, he knows about the flat then,”\n he thought suddenly, “and he tells it me himself!”\n\n“Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, a\ncase of morbid psychology,” Porfiry went on quickly. “A man confessed to\nmurder and how he kept it up! It was a regular hallucination; he brought\nforward facts, he imposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly, but\nonly partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that\nhe had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, it\ngot on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and he\npersuaded himself that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court\nof Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under\nproper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-tut-tut! Why, my dear\nfellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse\nto work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about\nblood! I’ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man\nis sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry. Just the\nsame with bell-ringing.... It’s all illness, Rodion Romanovitch! You\nhave begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an experienced\ndoctor, what’s the good of that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! You\nwere delirious when you did all this!”\n\nFor a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.\n\n“Is it possible, is it possible,” flashed through his mind, “that he is\nstill lying? He can’t be, he can’t be.” He rejected that idea, feeling\nto what a degree of fury it might drive him, feeling that that fury\nmight drive him mad.\n\n“I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing,” he cried, straining\nevery faculty to penetrate Porfiry’s game, “I was quite myself, do you\nhear?”\n\n“Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you were not delirious,\nyou were particularly emphatic about it! I understand all you can tell\nme! A-ach!... Listen, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow. If you were\nactually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business,\nwould you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession\nof your faculties? And so emphatically and persistently? Would it be\npossible? Quite impossible, to my thinking. If you had anything on\nyour conscience, you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious.\nThat’s so, isn’t it?”\n\nThere was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov drew back on\nthe sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at\nhim.\n\n“Another thing about Razumihin--you certainly ought to have said that he\ncame of his own accord, to have concealed your part in it! But you don’t\nconceal it! You lay stress on his coming at your instigation.”\n\nRaskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down his back.\n\n“You keep telling lies,” he said slowly and weakly, twisting his lips\ninto a sickly smile, “you are trying again to show that you know all\nmy game, that you know all I shall say beforehand,” he said, conscious\nhimself that he was not weighing his words as he ought. “You want to\nfrighten me... or you are simply laughing at me...”\n\nHe still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of\nintense hatred in his eyes.\n\n“You keep lying,” he said. “You know perfectly well that the best\npolicy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible... to\nconceal as little as possible. I don’t believe you!”\n\n“What a wily person you are!” Porfiry tittered, “there’s no catching\nyou; you’ve a perfect monomania. So you don’t believe me? But still you\ndo believe me, you believe a quarter; I’ll soon make you believe the\nwhole, because I have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you\ngood.”\n\nRaskolnikov’s lips trembled.\n\n“Yes, I do,” went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov’s arm genially, “you\nmust take care of your illness. Besides, your mother and sister are here\nnow; you must think of them. You must soothe and comfort them and you do\nnothing but frighten them...”\n\n“What has that to do with you? How do you know it? What concern is it of\nyours? You are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it?”\n\n“Good heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! You don’t\nnotice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything. From\nRazumihin, too, I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday. No,\nyou interrupted me, but I must tell you that, for all your wit, your\nsuspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things. To return\nto bell-ringing, for instance. I, an examining lawyer, have betrayed a\nprecious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having),\nand you see nothing in it! Why, if I had the slightest suspicion of you,\nshould I have acted like that? No, I should first have disarmed your\nsuspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted\nyour attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your\nexpression) saying: ‘And what were you doing, sir, pray, at ten or\nnearly eleven at the murdered woman’s flat and why did you ring the bell\nand why did you ask about blood? And why did you invite the porters\nto go with you to the police station, to the lieutenant?’ That’s how\nI ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought to\nhave taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and perhaps\nhave arrested you, too... so I have no suspicion of you, since I have\nnot done that! But you can’t look at it normally and you see nothing, I\nsay again.”\n\nRaskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not fail to\nperceive it.\n\n“You are lying all the while,” he cried, “I don’t know your object,\nbut you are lying. You did not speak like that just now and I cannot be\nmistaken!”\n\n“I am lying?” Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but preserving\na good-humoured and ironical face, as though he were not in the least\nconcerned at Raskolnikov’s opinion of him. “I am lying... but how did\nI treat you just now, I, the examining lawyer? Prompting you and giving\nyou every means for your defence; illness, I said, delirium, injury,\nmelancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it? Ah! He-he-he!\nThough, indeed, all those psychological means of defence are not very\nreliable and cut both ways: illness, delirium, I don’t remember--that’s\nall right, but why, my good sir, in your illness and in your delirium\nwere you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others? There\nmay have been others, eh? He-he-he!”\n\nRaskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him.\n\n“Briefly,” he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet and in so\ndoing pushing Porfiry back a little, “briefly, I want to know, do you\nacknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not? Tell me, Porfiry\nPetrovitch, tell me once for all and make haste!”\n\n“What a business I’m having with you!” cried Porfiry with a perfectly\ngood-humoured, sly and composed face. “And why do you want to know, why\ndo you want to know so much, since they haven’t begun to worry you? Why,\nyou are like a child asking for matches! And why are you so uneasy? Why\ndo you force yourself upon us, eh? He-he-he!”\n\n“I repeat,” Raskolnikov cried furiously, “that I can’t put up with it!”\n\n“With what? Uncertainty?” interrupted Porfiry.\n\n“Don’t jeer at me! I won’t have it! I tell you I won’t have it. I can’t\nand I won’t, do you hear, do you hear?” he shouted, bringing his fist\ndown on the table again.\n\n“Hush! Hush! They’ll overhear! I warn you seriously, take care of\nyourself. I am not joking,” Porfiry whispered, but this time there was\nnot the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face. Now\nhe was peremptory, stern, frowning and for once laying aside all\nmystification.\n\nBut this was only for an instant. Raskolnikov, bewildered, suddenly fell\ninto actual frenzy, but, strange to say, he again obeyed the command to\nspeak quietly, though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury.\n\n“I will not allow myself to be tortured,” he whispered, instantly\nrecognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and\ndriven to even greater fury by the thought. “Arrest me, search me, but\nkindly act in due form and don’t play with me! Don’t dare!”\n\n“Don’t worry about the form,” Porfiry interrupted with the same sly\nsmile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov. “I invited\nyou to see me quite in a friendly way.”\n\n“I don’t want your friendship and I spit on it! Do you hear? And, here,\nI take my cap and go. What will you say now if you mean to arrest me?”\n\nHe took up his cap and went to the door.\n\n“And won’t you see my little surprise?” chuckled Porfiry, again taking\nhim by the arm and stopping him at the door.\n\nHe seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddened\nRaskolnikov.\n\n“What surprise?” he asked, standing still and looking at Porfiry in\nalarm.\n\n“My little surprise, it’s sitting there behind the door, he-he-he!”\n (He pointed to the locked door.) “I locked him in that he should not\nescape.”\n\n“What is it? Where? What?...”\n\nRaskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it, but it was\nlocked.\n\n“It’s locked, here is the key!”\n\nAnd he brought a key out of his pocket.\n\n“You are lying,” roared Raskolnikov without restraint, “you lie, you\ndamned punchinello!” and he rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other\ndoor, not at all alarmed.\n\n“I understand it all! You are lying and mocking so that I may betray\nmyself to you...”\n\n“Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear Rodion\nRomanovitch. You are in a passion. Don’t shout, I shall call the\nclerks.”\n\n“You are lying! Call the clerks! You knew I was ill and tried to work\nme into a frenzy to make me betray myself, that was your object! Produce\nyour facts! I understand it all. You’ve no evidence, you have only\nwretched rubbishly suspicions like Zametov’s! You knew my character, you\nwanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and\ndeputies.... Are you waiting for them? eh! What are you waiting for?\nWhere are they? Produce them?”\n\n“Why deputies, my good man? What things people will imagine! And to do\nso would not be acting in form as you say, you don’t know the business,\nmy dear fellow.... And there’s no escaping form, as you see,” Porfiry\nmuttered, listening at the door through which a noise could be heard.\n\n“Ah, they’re coming,” cried Raskolnikov. “You’ve sent for them! You\nexpected them! Well, produce them all: your deputies, your witnesses,\nwhat you like!... I am ready!”\n\nBut at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected\nthat neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for\nsuch a conclusion to their interview.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nWhen he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how Raskolnikov saw it.\n\nThe noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the door was opened a\nlittle.\n\n“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed. “Why, I gave orders...”\n\nFor an instant there was no answer, but it was evident that there were\nseveral persons at the door, and that they were apparently pushing\nsomebody back.\n\n“What is it?” Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily.\n\n“The prisoner Nikolay has been brought,” someone answered.\n\n“He is not wanted! Take him away! Let him wait! What’s he doing here?\nHow irregular!” cried Porfiry, rushing to the door.\n\n“But he...” began the same voice, and suddenly ceased.\n\nTwo seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gave\na violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room.\n\nThis man’s appearance was at first sight very strange. He stared\nstraight before him, as though seeing nothing. There was a determined\ngleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his\nface, as though he were being led to the scaffold. His white lips were\nfaintly twitching.\n\nHe was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young,\nslim, his hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features. The man whom\nhe had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing\nhim by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away.\n\nSeveral persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. Some of them\ntried to get in. All this took place almost instantaneously.\n\n“Go away, it’s too soon! Wait till you are sent for!... Why have you\nbrought him so soon?” Porfiry Petrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed,\nand as it were thrown out of his reckoning.\n\nBut Nikolay suddenly knelt down.\n\n“What’s the matter?” cried Porfiry, surprised.\n\n“I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer,” Nikolay articulated\nsuddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly.\n\nFor ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb;\neven the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and\nstood immovable.\n\n“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his momentary\nstupefaction.\n\n“I... am the murderer,” repeated Nikolay, after a brief pause.\n\n“What... you... what... whom did you kill?” Porfiry Petrovitch was\nobviously bewildered.\n\nNikolay again was silent for a moment.\n\n“Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I... killed... with\nan axe. Darkness came over me,” he added suddenly, and was again silent.\n\nHe still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some\nmoments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back\nthe uninvited spectators. They instantly vanished and closed the door.\nThen he looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner,\nstaring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short,\nlooked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, and\nseeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.\n\n“You’re in too great a hurry,” he shouted at him, almost angrily. “I\ndidn’t ask you what came over you.... Speak, did you kill them?”\n\n“I am the murderer.... I want to give evidence,” Nikolay pronounced.\n\n“Ach! What did you kill them with?”\n\n“An axe. I had it ready.”\n\n“Ach, he is in a hurry! Alone?”\n\nNikolay did not understand the question.\n\n“Did you do it alone?”\n\n“Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it.”\n\n“Don’t be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you ran downstairs\nlike that at the time? The porters met you both!”\n\n“It was to put them off the scent... I ran after Mitka,” Nikolay replied\nhurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer.\n\n“I knew it!” cried Porfiry, with vexation. “It’s not his own tale he is\ntelling,” he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes rested\non Raskolnikov again.\n\nHe was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had\nforgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken aback.\n\n“My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!” he flew up to him, “this won’t\ndo; I’m afraid you must go... it’s no good your staying... I will...\nyou see, what a surprise!... Good-bye!”\n\nAnd taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.\n\n“I suppose you didn’t expect it?” said Raskolnikov who, though he had\nnot yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his courage.\n\n“You did not expect it either, my friend. See how your hand is\ntrembling! He-he!”\n\n“You’re trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!”\n\n“Yes, I am; I didn’t expect it.”\n\nThey were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov to\nbe gone.\n\n“And your little surprise, aren’t you going to show it to me?”\n Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.\n\n“Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he! You are an ironical\nperson! Come, till we meet!”\n\n“I believe we can say _good-bye_!”\n\n“That’s in God’s hands,” muttered Porfiry, with an unnatural smile.\n\nAs he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people\nwere looking at him. Among them he saw the two porters from _the_ house,\nwhom he had invited that night to the police station. They stood there\nwaiting. But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of\nPorfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the latter running\nafter him, out of breath.\n\n“One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it’s in God’s hands,\nbut as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to ask\nyou... so we shall meet again, shan’t we?”\n\nAnd Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.\n\n“Shan’t we?” he added again.\n\nHe seemed to want to say something more, but could not speak out.\n\n“You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has just passed... I\nlost my temper,” began Raskolnikov, who had so far regained his courage\nthat he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness.\n\n“Don’t mention it, don’t mention it,” Porfiry replied, almost gleefully.\n“I myself, too... I have a wicked temper, I admit it! But we shall meet\nagain. If it’s God’s will, we may see a great deal of one another.”\n\n“And will get to know each other through and through?” added\nRaskolnikov.\n\n“Yes; know each other through and through,” assented Porfiry Petrovitch,\nand he screwed up his eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov. “Now\nyou’re going to a birthday party?”\n\n“To a funeral.”\n\n“Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get well.”\n\n“I don’t know what to wish you,” said Raskolnikov, who had begun to\ndescend the stairs, but looked back again. “I should like to wish you\nsuccess, but your office is such a comical one.”\n\n“Why comical?” Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but he seemed to\nprick up his ears at this.\n\n“Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay\npsychologically, after your fashion, till he confessed! You must have\nbeen at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, and\nnow that he has confessed, you’ll begin vivisecting him again. ‘You are\nlying,’ you’ll say. ‘You are not the murderer! You can’t be! It’s not\nyour own tale you are telling!’ You must admit it’s a comical business!”\n\n“He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it was\nnot his own tale he was telling?”\n\n“How could I help noticing it!”\n\n“He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! You’ve really a\nplayful mind! And you always fasten on the comic side... he-he! They say\nthat was the marked characteristic of Gogol, among the writers.”\n\n“Yes, of Gogol.”\n\n“Yes, of Gogol.... I shall look forward to meeting you.”\n\n“So shall I.”\n\nRaskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled and bewildered that\non getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to\ncollect his thoughts. He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he\nwas stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable,\namazing--something beyond his understanding. But Nikolay’s confession\nwas an actual fact. The consequences of this fact were clear to him at\nonce, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they\nwould be after him again. Till then, at least, he was free and must do\nsomething for himself, for the danger was imminent.\n\nBut how imminent? His position gradually became clear to him.\nRemembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his recent scene with\nPorfiry, he could not help shuddering again with horror. Of course,\nhe did not yet know all Porfiry’s aims, he could not see into all his\ncalculations. But he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew\nbetter than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry’s “lead” had been for\nhim. A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely,\ncircumstantially. Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first\nglance seeing through him, Porfiry, though playing a bold game, was\nbound to win. There’s no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised\nhimself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was\nnothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the position? Wasn’t\nhe mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying to get at? Had he really some\nsurprise prepared for him? And what was it? Had he really been expecting\nsomething or not? How would they have parted if it had not been for the\nunexpected appearance of Nikolay?\n\nPorfiry had shown almost all his cards--of course, he had risked\nsomething in showing them--and if he had really had anything up his\nsleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he would have shown that, too. What was\nthat “surprise”? Was it a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it have\nconcealed anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? His\nyesterday’s visitor? What had become of him? Where was he to-day? If\nPorfiry really had any evidence, it must be connected with him....\n\nHe sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in\nhis hands. He was still shivering nervously. At last he got up, took his\ncap, thought a minute, and went to the door.\n\nHe had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he might\nconsider himself out of danger. He had a sudden sense almost of joy; he\nwanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovna’s. He would be too late for\nthe funeral, of course, but he would be in time for the memorial dinner,\nand there at once he would see Sonia.\n\nHe stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile came for a\nmoment on to his lips.\n\n“To-day! To-day,” he repeated to himself. “Yes, to-day! So it must\nbe....”\n\nBut as he was about to open the door, it began opening of itself. He\nstarted and moved back. The door opened gently and slowly, and there\nsuddenly appeared a figure--yesterday’s visitor _from underground_.\n\nThe man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking,\nand took a step forward into the room. He was exactly the same as\nyesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great change\nin his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only put\nhis hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have\nlooked exactly like a peasant woman.\n\n“What do you want?” asked Raskolnikov, numb with terror. The man was\nstill silent, but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground, touching\nit with his finger.\n\n“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.\n\n“I have sinned,” the man articulated softly.\n\n“How?”\n\n“By evil thoughts.”\n\nThey looked at one another.\n\n“I was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink, and bade the porters go\nto the police station and asked about the blood, I was vexed that they\nlet you go and took you for drunken. I was so vexed that I lost my\nsleep. And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for\nyou....”\n\n“Who came?” Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect.\n\n“I did, I’ve wronged you.”\n\n“Then you come from that house?”\n\n“I was standing at the gate with them... don’t you remember? We have\ncarried on our trade in that house for years past. We cure and prepare\nhides, we take work home... most of all I was vexed....”\n\nAnd the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came\nclearly before Raskolnikov’s mind; he recollected that there had\nbeen several people there besides the porters, women among them.\nHe remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the\npolice-station. He could not recall the face of the speaker, and even\nnow he did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned round\nand made him some answer....\n\nSo this was the solution of yesterday’s horror. The most awful thought\nwas that he had been actually almost lost, had almost done for himself\non account of such a _trivial_ circumstance. So this man could tell\nnothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains. So\nPorfiry, too, had nothing but that _delirium_, no facts but this\n_psychology_ which _cuts both ways_, nothing positive. So if no more\nfacts come to light (and they must not, they must not!) then... then\nwhat can they do to him? How can they convict him, even if they arrest\nhim? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not\nknown about it before.\n\n“Was it you who told Porfiry... that I’d been there?” he cried, struck\nby a sudden idea.\n\n“What Porfiry?”\n\n“The head of the detective department?”\n\n“Yes. The porters did not go there, but I went.”\n\n“To-day?”\n\n“I got there two minutes before you. And I heard, I heard it all, how he\nworried you.”\n\n“Where? What? When?”\n\n“Why, in the next room. I was sitting there all the time.”\n\n“What? Why, then you were the surprise? But how could it happen? Upon my\nword!”\n\n“I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said,” began the man;\n“for it’s too late, said they, and maybe he’ll be angry that we did not\ncome at the time. I was vexed and I lost my sleep, and I began making\ninquiries. And finding out yesterday where to go, I went to-day. The\nfirst time I went he wasn’t there, when I came an hour later he couldn’t\nsee me. I went the third time, and they showed me in. I informed him of\neverything, just as it happened, and he began skipping about the room\nand punching himself on the chest. ‘What do you scoundrels mean by it?\nIf I’d known about it I should have arrested him!’ Then he ran out,\ncalled somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he turned\nto me, scolding and questioning me. He scolded me a great deal; and I\ntold him everything, and I told him that you didn’t dare to say a word\nin answer to me yesterday and that you didn’t recognise me. And he\nfell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest, and\ngetting angry and running about, and when you were announced he told\nme to go into the next room. ‘Sit there a bit,’ he said. ‘Don’t move,\nwhatever you may hear.’ And he set a chair there for me and locked\nme in. ‘Perhaps,’ he said, ‘I may call you.’ And when Nikolay’d been\nbrought he let me out as soon as you were gone. ‘I shall send for you\nagain and question you,’ he said.”\n\n“And did he question Nikolay while you were there?”\n\n“He got rid of me as he did of you, before he spoke to Nikolay.”\n\nThe man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, touching the ground\nwith his finger.\n\n“Forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander.”\n\n“May God forgive you,” answered Raskolnikov.\n\nAnd as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not to the ground,\nturned slowly and went out of the room.\n\n“It all cuts both ways, now it all cuts both ways,” repeated\nRaskolnikov, and he went out more confident than ever.\n\n“Now we’ll make a fight for it,” he said, with a malicious smile, as he\nwent down the stairs. His malice was aimed at himself; with shame and\ncontempt he recollected his “cowardice.”\n\n\n\n\nPART V\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nThe morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and\nher mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.\nIntensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to accept\nas a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before\nfantastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity had been\ngnawing at his heart all night. When he got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch\nimmediately looked in the looking-glass. He was afraid that he had\njaundice. However his health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at\nhis noble, clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of\nlate, Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the\nconviction that he would find another bride and, perhaps, even a better\none. But coming back to the sense of his present position, he turned\naside and spat vigorously, which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey\nSemyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was staying.\nThat smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his\nyoung friend’s account. He had set down a good many points against him\nof late. His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to\nhave told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday’s interview.\nThat was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsiveness\nand irritability.... Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness\nfollowed another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case\nin the senate. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat\nwhich had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being\nredecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman,\nwould not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just\nbeen signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr\nPetrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In\nthe same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the\ninstalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the\nflat.\n\n“Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?” Pyotr\nPetrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a\ngleam of desperate hope. “Can all that be really so irrevocably over?\nIs it no use to make another effort?” The thought of Dounia sent a\nvoluptuous pang through his heart. He endured anguish at that moment,\nand if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it,\nPyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.\n\n“It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,” he thought, as\nhe returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov’s room, “and why on earth was I\nsuch a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to keep them without a penny\nso that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!\nfoo! If I’d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau\nand presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, and\nall that sort of trash from Knopp’s and the English shop, my position\nwould have been better and... stronger! They could not have refused me\nso easily! They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return\nmoney and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to\ndo it! And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man\nwho has hitherto been so generous and delicate?.... H’m! I’ve made a\nblunder.”\n\nAnd grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called himself a\nfool--but not aloud, of course.\n\nHe returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. The\npreparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovna’s excited\nhis curiosity as he passed. He had heard about it the day before; he\nfancied, indeed, that he had been invited, but absorbed in his own cares\nhe had paid no attention. Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy\nlaying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he\nheard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the\nlodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead\nman, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of\nhis previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch,\nwas not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most\nimportant of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with\ngreat ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she was\nvery busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them;\nshe was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she\nwas proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he\nwent into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov’s, somewhat thoughtful. He\nhad learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests.\n\nAndrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning. The attitude of\nPyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural.\nPyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay\nwith him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He\nhad not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from\nparsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object. He had heard\nof Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young\nprogressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting\ncircles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had\nimpressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient circles who\ndespised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a\npeculiar but quite vague alarm. He had not, of course, been able to form\neven an approximate notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had\nheard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some\nsort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and\ndistorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree. What for\nmany years past he had feared more than anything was _being shown\nup_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the\nthought of transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of\nthis as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some years before,\nwhen he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two cases\nin which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his,\nhad been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal\nfor the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious\ntrouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the\nsubject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to\nanticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of “our younger\ngeneration.” He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before\nhis visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current\nphrases. He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace\nsimpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. Even if he\nhad been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it\nwould not have allayed his uneasiness. All the doctrines, the ideas, the\nsystems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for\nhim. He had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once what\nwas happening _here_. Had these people any power or not? Had he anything\nto fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his? And what\nprecisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he somehow make up\nto them and get round them if they really were powerful? Was this the\nthing to do or not? Couldn’t he gain something through them? In fact\nhundreds of questions presented themselves.\n\nAndrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little man, with strangely\nflaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud. He was a clerk\nand had almost always something wrong with his eyes. He was rather\nsoft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in\nspeech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure.\nHe was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did\nnot get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch\nreally was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress\nand “our younger generation” from enthusiasm. He was one of the numerous\nand varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited,\nhalf-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most in\nfashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve,\nhowever sincerely.\n\nThough Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was beginning to\ndislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on both sides unconsciously.\nHowever simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr\nPetrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him, and that “he was\nnot the right sort of man.” He had tried expounding to him the system of\nFourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to\nlisten too sarcastically and even to be rude. The fact was he had begun\ninstinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace\nsimpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections of\nany consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things up\nthird-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own\nwork of propaganda, for he was in too great a muddle. A fine person he\nwould be to show anyone up! It must be noted, by the way, that Pyotr\nPetrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest\npraise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had not protested, for instance,\nwhen Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to\nthe establishment of the new “commune,” or to abstain from christening\nhis future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a\nmonth after marriage, and so on. Pyotr Petrovitch so enjoyed hearing\nhis own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were\nattributed to him.\n\nPyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some\nfive-per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over\nbundles of notes. Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money\nwalked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank\nnotes with indifference and even contempt. Nothing would have convinced\nPyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch could really look on the money\nunmoved, and the latter, on his side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr\nPetrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him and\nwas, perhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend by\nreminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them.\n\nHe found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though he, Andrey\nSemyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite subject, the foundation\nof a new special “commune.” The brief remarks that dropped from Pyotr\nPetrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame\nbetrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony. But the “humane” Andrey\nSemyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch’s ill-humour to his recent breach\nwith Dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that\ntheme. He had something progressive to say on the subject which\nmight console his worthy friend and “could not fail” to promote his\ndevelopment.\n\n“There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that... at the\nwidow’s, isn’t there?” Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly, interrupting\nAndrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting passage.\n\n“Why, don’t you know? Why, I was telling you last night what I think\nabout all such ceremonies. And she invited you too, I heard. You were\ntalking to her yesterday...”\n\n“I should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on\nthis feast all the money she got from that other fool, Raskolnikov. I\nwas surprised just now as I came through at the preparations there, the\nwines! Several people are invited. It’s beyond everything!” continued\nPyotr Petrovitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing the\nconversation. “What? You say I am asked too? When was that? I don’t\nremember. But I shan’t go. Why should I? I only said a word to her in\npassing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a year’s salary as\na destitute widow of a government clerk. I suppose she has invited me on\nthat account, hasn’t she? He-he-he!”\n\n“I don’t intend to go either,” said Lebeziatnikov.\n\n“I should think not, after giving her a thrashing! You might well\nhesitate, he-he!”\n\n“Who thrashed? Whom?” cried Lebeziatnikov, flustered and blushing.\n\n“Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. I heard so\nyesterday... so that’s what your convictions amount to... and the woman\nquestion, too, wasn’t quite sound, he-he-he!” and Pyotr Petrovitch, as\nthough comforted, went back to clicking his beads.\n\n“It’s all slander and nonsense!” cried Lebeziatnikov, who was always\nafraid of allusions to the subject. “It was not like that at all, it\nwas quite different. You’ve heard it wrong; it’s a libel. I was simply\ndefending myself. She rushed at me first with her nails, she pulled\nout all my whiskers.... It’s permissable for anyone, I should hope,\nto defend himself and I never allow anyone to use violence to me on\nprinciple, for it’s an act of despotism. What was I to do? I simply\npushed her back.”\n\n“He-he-he!” Luzhin went on laughing maliciously.\n\n“You keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself.... But\nthat’s nonsense and it has nothing, nothing whatever to do with the\nwoman question! You don’t understand; I used to think, indeed, that\nif women are equal to men in all respects, even in strength (as is\nmaintained now) there ought to be equality in that, too. Of course, I\nreflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise,\nfor there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is\nunthinkable... and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality\nin fighting. I am not so stupid... though, of course, there is\nfighting... there won’t be later, but at present there is... confound\nit! How muddled one gets with you! It’s not on that account that I\nam not going. I am not going on principle, not to take part in the\nrevolting convention of memorial dinners, that’s why! Though, of course,\none might go to laugh at it.... I am sorry there won’t be any priests at\nit. I should certainly go if there were.”\n\n“Then you would sit down at another man’s table and insult it and those\nwho invited you. Eh?”\n\n“Certainly not insult, but protest. I should do it with a good object. I\nmight indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda. It’s\na duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the\nmore harshly, perhaps, the better. I might drop a seed, an idea.... And\nsomething might grow up from that seed. How should I be insulting them?\nThey might be offended at first, but afterwards they’d see I’d done them\na service. You know, Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed\nbecause when she left her family and... devoted... herself, she wrote to\nher father and mother that she wouldn’t go on living conventionally and\nwas entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh,\nthat she might have spared them and have written more kindly. I think\nthat’s all nonsense and there’s no need of softness; on the contrary,\nwhat’s wanted is protest. Varents had been married seven years, she\nabandoned her two children, she told her husband straight out in a\nletter: ‘I have realised that I cannot be happy with you. I can never\nforgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there\nis another organisation of society by means of the communities. I have\nonly lately learned it from a great-hearted man to whom I have given\nmyself and with whom I am establishing a community. I speak plainly\nbecause I consider it dishonest to deceive you. Do as you think best.\nDo not hope to get me back, you are too late. I hope you will be happy.’\nThat’s how letters like that ought to be written!”\n\n“Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage?”\n\n“No, it’s only the second, really! But what if it were the fourth, what\nif it were the fifteenth, that’s all nonsense! And if ever I regretted\nthe death of my father and mother, it is now, and I sometimes think\nif my parents were living what a protest I would have aimed at them! I\nwould have done something on purpose... I would have shown them! I would\nhave astonished them! I am really sorry there is no one!”\n\n“To surprise! He-he! Well, be that as you will,” Pyotr Petrovitch\ninterrupted, “but tell me this; do you know the dead man’s daughter, the\ndelicate-looking little thing? It’s true what they say about her, isn’t\nit?”\n\n“What of it? I think, that is, it is my own personal conviction that\nthis is the normal condition of women. Why not? I mean, _distinguons_.\nIn our present society it is not altogether normal, because it is\ncompulsory, but in the future society it will be perfectly normal,\nbecause it will be voluntary. Even as it is, she was quite right: she\nwas suffering and that was her asset, so to speak, her capital which\nshe had a perfect right to dispose of. Of course, in the future\nsociety there will be no need of assets, but her part will have another\nsignificance, rational and in harmony with her environment. As to Sofya\nSemyonovna personally, I regard her action as a vigorous protest against\nthe organisation of society, and I respect her deeply for it; I rejoice\nindeed when I look at her!”\n\n“I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings.”\n\nLebeziatnikov was enraged.\n\n“That’s another slander,” he yelled. “It was not so at all! That was all\nKaterina Ivanovna’s invention, for she did not understand! And I never\nmade love to Sofya Semyonovna! I was simply developing her, entirely\ndisinterestedly, trying to rouse her to protest.... All I wanted was her\nprotest and Sofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!”\n\n“Have you asked her to join your community?”\n\n“You keep on laughing and very inappropriately, allow me to tell\nyou. You don’t understand! There is no such rôle in a community. The\ncommunity is established that there should be no such rôles. In a\ncommunity, such a rôle is essentially transformed and what is stupid\nhere is sensible there, what, under present conditions, is unnatural\nbecomes perfectly natural in the community. It all depends on the\nenvironment. It’s all the environment and man himself is nothing. And\nI am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this day, which is a proof\nthat she never regarded me as having wronged her. I am trying now to\nattract her to the community, but on quite, quite a different footing.\nWhat are you laughing at? We are trying to establish a community of\nour own, a special one, on a broader basis. We have gone further in our\nconvictions. We reject more! And meanwhile I’m still developing Sofya\nSemyonovna. She has a beautiful, beautiful character!”\n\n“And you take advantage of her fine character, eh? He-he!”\n\n“No, no! Oh, no! On the contrary.”\n\n“Oh, on the contrary! He-he-he! A queer thing to say!”\n\n“Believe me! Why should I disguise it? In fact, I feel it strange myself\nhow timid, chaste and modern she is with me!”\n\n“And you, of course, are developing her... he-he! trying to prove to her\nthat all that modesty is nonsense?”\n\n“Not at all, not at all! How coarsely, how stupidly--excuse me saying\nso--you misunderstand the word development! Good heavens, how... crude\nyou still are! We are striving for the freedom of women and you have\nonly one idea in your head.... Setting aside the general question\nof chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed\nprejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because that’s for her\nto decide. Of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me,\nI should think myself very lucky, because I like the girl very much; but\nas it is, no one has ever treated her more courteously than I, with more\nrespect for her dignity... I wait in hopes, that’s all!”\n\n“You had much better make her a present of something. I bet you never\nthought of that.”\n\n“You don’t understand, as I’ve told you already! Of course, she is in\nsuch a position, but it’s another question. Quite another question!\nYou simply despise her. Seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider\ndeserving of contempt, you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow\ncreature. You don’t know what a character she is! I am only sorry that\nof late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books. I used\nto lend them to her. I am sorry, too, that with all the energy and\nresolution in protesting--which she has already shown once--she has\nlittle self-reliance, little, so to say, independence, so as to\nbreak free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas. Yet she\nthoroughly understands some questions, for instance about kissing of\nhands, that is, that it’s an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her\nhand, because it’s a sign of inequality. We had a debate about it and\nI described it to her. She listened attentively to an account of the\nworkmen’s associations in France, too. Now I am explaining the question\nof coming into the room in the future society.”\n\n“And what’s that, pray?”\n\n“We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of the community\nthe right to enter another member’s room, whether man or woman, at any\ntime... and we decided that he has!”\n\n“It might be at an inconvenient moment, he-he!”\n\nLebeziatnikov was really angry.\n\n“You are always thinking of something unpleasant,” he cried with\naversion. “Tfoo! How vexed I am that when I was expounding our system, I\nreferred prematurely to the question of personal privacy! It’s always\na stumbling-block to people like you, they turn it into ridicule before\nthey understand it. And how proud they are of it, too! Tfoo! I’ve often\nmaintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till\nhe has a firm faith in the system. And tell me, please, what do you\nfind so shameful even in cesspools? I should be the first to be ready\nto clean out any cesspool you like. And it’s not a question of\nself-sacrifice, it’s simply work, honourable, useful work which is\nas good as any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a\nPushkin, because it is more useful.”\n\n“And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he!”\n\n“What do you mean by ‘more honourable’? I don’t understand such\nexpressions to describe human activity. ‘More honourable,’ ‘nobler’--all\nthose are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which is\n_of use_ to mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: _useful_!\nYou can snigger as much as you like, but that’s so!”\n\nPyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily. He had finished counting the money\nand was putting it away. But some of the notes he left on the table. The\n“cesspool question” had already been a subject of dispute between them.\nWhat was absurd was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry, while it\namused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger his\nyoung friend.\n\n“It’s your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-humoured and\nannoying,” blurted out Lebeziatnikov, who in spite of his “independence”\n and his “protests” did not venture to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still\nbehaved to him with some of the respect habitual in earlier years.\n\n“You’d better tell me this,” Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted with haughty\ndispleasure, “can you... or rather are you really friendly enough with\nthat young person to ask her to step in here for a minute? I think\nthey’ve all come back from the cemetery... I heard the sound of\nsteps... I want to see her, that young person.”\n\n“What for?” Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise.\n\n“Oh, I want to. I am leaving here to-day or to-morrow and therefore I\nwanted to speak to her about... However, you may be present during the\ninterview. It’s better you should be, indeed. For there’s no knowing\nwhat you might imagine.”\n\n“I shan’t imagine anything. I only asked and, if you’ve anything to say\nto her, nothing is easier than to call her in. I’ll go directly and you\nmay be sure I won’t be in your way.”\n\nFive minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. She came in very\nmuch surprised and overcome with shyness as usual. She was always shy in\nsuch circumstances and was always afraid of new people, she had been as\na child and was even more so now.... Pyotr Petrovitch met her “politely\nand affably,” but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in\nhis opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight\nin dealing with a creature so young and so _interesting_ as she. He\nhastened to “reassure” her and made her sit down facing him at the\ntable. Sonia sat down, looked about her--at Lebeziatnikov, at the notes\nlying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and her eyes\nremained riveted on him. Lebeziatnikov was moving to the door. Pyotr\nPetrovitch signed to Sonia to remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.\n\n“Is Raskolnikov in there? Has he come?” he asked him in a whisper.\n\n“Raskolnikov? Yes. Why? Yes, he is there. I saw him just come in....\nWhy?”\n\n“Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave\nme alone with this... young woman. I only want a few words with her,\nbut God knows what they may make of it. I shouldn’t like Raskolnikov to\nrepeat anything.... You understand what I mean?”\n\n“I understand!” Lebeziatnikov saw the point. “Yes, you are right.... Of\ncourse, I am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy,\nbut... still, you are right. Certainly I’ll stay. I’ll stand here at the\nwindow and not be in your way... I think you are right...”\n\nPyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down opposite Sonia, looked\nattentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified, even severe\nexpression, as much as to say, “don’t you make any mistake, madam.”\n Sonia was overwhelmed with embarrassment.\n\n“In the first place, Sofya Semyonovna, will you make my excuses to your\nrespected mamma.... That’s right, isn’t it? Katerina Ivanovna stands\nin the place of a mother to you?” Pyotr Petrovitch began with great\ndignity, though affably.\n\nIt was evident that his intentions were friendly.\n\n“Quite so, yes; the place of a mother,” Sonia answered, timidly and\nhurriedly.\n\n“Then will you make my apologies to her? Through inevitable\ncircumstances I am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in\nspite of your mamma’s kind invitation.”\n\n“Yes... I’ll tell her... at once.”\n\nAnd Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat.\n\n“Wait, that’s not all,” Pyotr Petrovitch detained her, smiling at her\nsimplicity and ignorance of good manners, “and you know me little, my\ndear Sofya Semyonovna, if you suppose I would have ventured to trouble\na person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself\nonly. I have another object.”\n\nSonia sat down hurriedly. Her eyes rested again for an instant on the\ngrey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that remained on the table, but she\nquickly looked away and fixed her eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch. She felt it\nhorribly indecorous, especially for _her_, to look at another person’s\nmoney. She stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held\nin his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a\nyellow stone on his middle finger. But suddenly she looked away and, not\nknowing where to turn, ended by staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight\nin the face. After a pause of still greater dignity he continued.\n\n“I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with\nKaterina Ivanovna, poor woman. That was sufficient to enable me to\nascertain that she is in a position--preternatural, if one may so\nexpress it.”\n\n“Yes... preternatural...” Sonia hurriedly assented.\n\n“Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, ill.”\n\n“Yes, simpler and more comprehen... yes, ill.”\n\n“Quite so. So then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak\ncompassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in any way,\nforeseeing her unfortunate position. I believe the whole of this\npoverty-stricken family depends now entirely on you?”\n\n“Allow me to ask,” Sonia rose to her feet, “did you say something to her\nyesterday of the possibility of a pension? Because she told me you had\nundertaken to get her one. Was that true?”\n\n“Not in the slightest, and indeed it’s an absurdity! I merely hinted at\nher obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had\ndied in the service--if only she has patronage... but apparently your\nlate parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the\nservice at all of late. In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be\nvery ephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance in\nthat case, far from it.... And she is dreaming of a pension already,\nhe-he-he!... A go-ahead lady!”\n\n“Yes, she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted, and she believes\neverything from the goodness of her heart and... and... and she is like\nthat... yes... You must excuse her,” said Sonia, and again she got up to\ngo.\n\n“But you haven’t heard what I have to say.”\n\n“No, I haven’t heard,” muttered Sonia.\n\n“Then sit down.” She was terribly confused; she sat down again a third\ntime.\n\n“Seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, I should be glad,\nas I have said before, so far as lies in my power, to be of service,\nthat is, so far as is in my power, not more. One might for instance get\nup a subscription for her, or a lottery, something of the sort, such as\nis always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous\nof assisting people. It was of that I intended to speak to you; it might\nbe done.”\n\n“Yes, yes... God will repay you for it,” faltered Sonia, gazing intently\nat Pyotr Petrovitch.\n\n“It might be, but we will talk of it later. We might begin it to-day, we\nwill talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak. Come\nto me at seven o’clock. Mr. Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us. But\nthere is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and\nfor which I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come here. In\nmy opinion money cannot be, indeed it’s unsafe to put it into Katerina\nIvanovna’s own hands. The dinner to-day is a proof of that. Though she\nhas not, so to speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and... well, boots\nor shoes, or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even,\nI believe, Madeira and... and coffee. I saw it as I passed through.\nTo-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they won’t have a crust of\nbread. It’s absurd, really, and so, to my thinking, a subscription ought\nto be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money, but\nonly you, for instance. Am I right?”\n\n“I don’t know... this is only to-day, once in her life.... She was\nso anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory.... And she is very\nsensible... but just as you think and I shall be very, very... they will\nall be... and God will reward... and the orphans...”\n\nSonia burst into tears.\n\n“Very well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you accept for the\nbenefit of your relation the small sum that I am able to spare, from me\npersonally. I am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in\nconnection with it. Here... having so to speak anxieties of my own, I\ncannot do more...”\n\nAnd Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note carefully\nunfolded. Sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped up, muttered something\nand began taking leave. Pyotr Petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously\nto the door. She got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed,\nand returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confusion.\n\nAll this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the\nroom, anxious not to interrupt the conversation; when Sonia had gone he\nwalked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand.\n\n“I heard and _saw_ everything,” he said, laying stress on the last verb.\n“That is honourable, I mean to say, it’s humane! You wanted to avoid\ngratitude, I saw! And although I cannot, I confess, in principle\nsympathise with private charity, for it not only fails to eradicate the\nevil but even promotes it, yet I must admit that I saw your action with\npleasure--yes, yes, I like it.”\n\n“That’s all nonsense,” muttered Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted,\nlooking carefully at Lebeziatnikov.\n\n“No, it’s not nonsense! A man who has suffered distress and annoyance as\nyou did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others,\nsuch a man... even though he is making a social mistake--is still\ndeserving of respect! I did not expect it indeed of you, Pyotr\nPetrovitch, especially as according to your ideas... oh, what a drawback\nyour ideas are to you! How distressed you are for instance by your\nill-luck yesterday,” cried the simple-hearted Lebeziatnikov, who felt\na return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch. “And, what do you want with\nmarriage, with _legal_ marriage, my dear, noble Pyotr Petrovitch? Why do\nyou cling to this _legality_ of marriage? Well, you may beat me if you\nlike, but I am glad, positively glad it hasn’t come off, that you are\nfree, that you are not quite lost for humanity.... you see, I’ve spoken\nmy mind!”\n\n“Because I don’t want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and\nto bring up another man’s children, that’s why I want legal marriage,”\n Luzhin replied in order to make some answer.\n\nHe seemed preoccupied by something.\n\n“Children? You referred to children,” Lebeziatnikov started off like\na warhorse at the trumpet call. “Children are a social question and a\nquestion of first importance, I agree; but the question of children has\nanother solution. Some refuse to have children altogether, because they\nsuggest the institution of the family. We’ll speak of children later,\nbut now as to the question of honour, I confess that’s my weak point.\nThat horrid, military, Pushkin expression is unthinkable in the\ndictionary of the future. What does it mean indeed? It’s nonsense,\nthere will be no deception in a free marriage! That is only the natural\nconsequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest.\nSo that indeed it’s not humiliating... and if I ever, to suppose an\nabsurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of\nit. I should say to my wife: ‘My dear, hitherto I have loved you, now\nI respect you, for you’ve shown you can protest!’ You laugh! That’s\nbecause you are incapable of getting away from prejudices. Confound\nit all! I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived\nin a legal marriage, but it’s simply a despicable consequence of a\ndespicable position in which both are humiliated. When the deception is\nopen, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it’s unthinkable.\nYour wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you\nincapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for\nher new husband. Damn it all! I sometimes dream if I were to be married,\npfoo! I mean if I were to marry, legally or not, it’s just the same,\nI should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for\nherself. ‘My dear,’ I should say, ‘I love you, but even more than that I\ndesire you to respect me. See!’ Am I not right?”\n\nPyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without much merriment.\nHe hardly heard it indeed. He was preoccupied with something else and\neven Lebeziatnikov at last noticed it. Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited\nand rubbed his hands. Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected\nupon it afterwards.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIt would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the\nidea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna’s disordered brain.\nNearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov’s\nfuneral, were wasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to\nhonour the memory of the deceased “suitably,” that all the lodgers,\nand still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know “that he was in no way their\ninferior, and perhaps very much their superior,” and that no one had the\nright “to turn up his nose at him.” Perhaps the chief element was that\npeculiar “poor man’s pride,” which compels many poor people to spend\ntheir last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order\nto do “like other people,” and not to “be looked down upon.” It is very\nprobable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, at\nthe moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those\n“wretched contemptible lodgers” that she knew “how to do things, how\nto entertain” and that she had been brought up “in a genteel, she might\nalmost say aristocratic colonel’s family” and had not been meant for\nsweeping floors and washing the children’s rags at night. Even the\npoorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these\nparoxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible\nnervous craving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she\nmight have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not have\nbeen broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her will\ncould not be crushed. Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her\nmind was unhinged. She could not be said to be insane, but for a year\npast she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained.\nThe later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to affect the\nintellect.\n\nThere was no great variety of wines, nor was there Madeira; but wine\nthere was. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorest\nquality but in sufficient quantity. Besides the traditional rice and\nhoney, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted of\npancakes, all prepared in Amalia Ivanovna’s kitchen. Two samovars were\nboiling, that tea and punch might be offered after dinner. Katerina\nIvanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the help\nof one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been\nstranded at Madame Lippevechsel’s. He promptly put himself at Katerina\nIvanovna’s disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before\nrunning about as fast as his legs could carry him, and very anxious\nthat everyone should be aware of it. For every trifle he ran to Katerina\nIvanovna, even hunting her out at the bazaar, at every instant called\nher “_Pani_.” She was heartily sick of him before the end, though\nshe had declared at first that she could not have got on without this\n“serviceable and magnanimous man.” It was one of Katerina Ivanovna’s\ncharacteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours.\nHer praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she\nwould invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance\nand quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden she\nwould be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the\nperson she had only a few hours before been literally adoring. She\nwas naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but from\ncontinual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so _keenly_\nthat all should live in peace and joy and should not _dare_ to break the\npeace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her almost\nto frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and\nfancies to cursing her fate and raving, and knocking her head against\nthe wall.\n\nAmalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in\nKaterina Ivanovna’s eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary\nrespect, probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart\nand soul into the preparations. She had undertaken to lay the table,\nto provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her\nkitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone\nherself to the cemetery. Everything had been well done. Even the\ntable-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glasses\nwere, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers,\nbut the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna,\nfeeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and\na cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some\npride. This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna for\nsome reason: “as though the table could not have been laid except by\nAmalia Ivanovna!” She disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. “Could she\nbe stuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of the house,\nand had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers! As a favour!\nFancy that! Katerina Ivanovna’s father who had been a colonel and almost\na governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons, and then\nanyone like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have been\nallowed into the kitchen.”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feelings for the\ntime and contented herself with treating her coldly, though she decided\ninwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down\nand set her in her proper place, for goodness only knew what she was\nfancying herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that\nhardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, except\nthe Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the\nmemorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned\nup, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober. The older\nand more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away.\nPyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most\nrespectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovna\nhad the evening before told all the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna,\nPolenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he was the most generous,\nnoble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had\nbeen a friend of her first husband’s, and a guest in her father’s\nhouse, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her\na considerable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna\nexalted anyone’s connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior\nmotive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to\nthe consequence of the person praised. Probably “taking his cue” from\nLuzhin, “that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up\neither. What did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kindness\nand because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was a\nfriend of his, so that it would have been awkward not to invite him.”\n\nAmong those who failed to appear were “the genteel lady and her\nold-maidish daughter,” who had only been lodgers in the house for the\nlast fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar\nin Katerina Ivanovna’s room, especially when Marmeladov had come\nback drunk. Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who,\nquarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole\nfamily out of doors, had shouted at her that they “were not worth the\nfoot” of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing. Katerina\nIvanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter, “whose\nfoot she was not worth,” and who had turned away haughtily when she\ncasually met them, so that they might know that “she was more noble in\nher thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice,” and might see\nthat she was not accustomed to her way of living. She had proposed to\nmake this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father’s\ngovernorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly\nstupid of them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major (he\nwas really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent, but it\nappeared that he had been “not himself” for the last two days. The party\nconsisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and\na greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smelt\nabominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the\npost office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone\nat Amalia Ivanovna’s.\n\nA retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he was\ndrunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy--was without\na waistcoat! One of the visitors sat straight down to the table without\neven greeting Katerina Ivanovna. Finally one person having no suit\nappeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of\nAmalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him. The Pole brought\nwith him, however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna’s\nand whom no one had seen here before. All this irritated Katerina\nIvanovna intensely. “For whom had they made all these preparations\nthen?” To make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid\nfor at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the\nfurthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka as a big\ngirl had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like\nwell-bred children’s.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her guests with\nincreased dignity, and even haughtiness. She stared at some of them with\nspecial severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats. Rushing\nto the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who\nwere absent, she began treating her with extreme nonchalance, which the\nlatter promptly observed and resented. Such a beginning was no good omen\nfor the end. All were seated at last.\n\nRaskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the\ncemetery. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him, in the\nfirst place, because he was the one “educated visitor, and, as everyone\nknew, was in two years to take a professorship in the university,” and\nsecondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having\nbeen unable to be at the funeral. She positively pounced upon him, and\nmade him sit on her left hand (Amalia Ivanovna was on her right). In\nspite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round\ncorrectly and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonising\ncough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse\nduring the last few days, she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to\nRaskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at\nthe failure of the dinner, interspersing her remarks with lively and\nuncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of\nher landlady.\n\n“It’s all that cuckoo’s fault! You know whom I mean? Her, her!” Katerina\nIvanovna nodded towards the landlady. “Look at her, she’s making round\neyes, she feels that we are talking about her and can’t understand.\nPfoo, the owl! Ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) And what does she put on that\ncap for? (Cough-cough-cough.) Have you noticed that she wants everyone\nto consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by being\nhere? I asked her like a sensible woman to invite people, especially\nthose who knew my late husband, and look at the set of fools she has\nbrought! The sweeps! Look at that one with the spotty face. And those\nwretched Poles, ha-ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) Not one of them has ever\npoked his nose in here, I’ve never set eyes on them. What have they come\nhere for, I ask you? There they sit in a row. Hey, _pan_!” she cried\nsuddenly to one of them, “have you tasted the pancakes? Take some more!\nHave some beer! Won’t you have some vodka? Look, he’s jumped up and is\nmaking his bows, they must be quite starved, poor things. Never mind,\nlet them eat! They don’t make a noise, anyway, though I’m really afraid\nfor our landlady’s silver spoons... Amalia Ivanovna!” she addressed her\nsuddenly, almost aloud, “if your spoons should happen to be stolen,\nI won’t be responsible, I warn you! Ha-ha-ha!” She laughed turning to\nRaskolnikov, and again nodding towards the landlady, in high glee at her\nsally. “She didn’t understand, she didn’t understand again! Look how\nshe sits with her mouth open! An owl, a real owl! An owl in new ribbons,\nha-ha-ha!”\n\nHere her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that\nlasted five minutes. Drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead\nand her handkerchief was stained with blood. She showed Raskolnikov\nthe blood in silence, and as soon as she could get her breath began\nwhispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her\ncheeks.\n\n“Do you know, I gave her the most delicate instructions, so to speak,\nfor inviting that lady and her daughter, you understand of whom I am\nspeaking? It needed the utmost delicacy, the greatest nicety, but she\nhas managed things so that that fool, that conceited baggage, that\nprovincial nonentity, simply because she is the widow of a major, and\nhas come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the\ngovernment offices, because at fifty she paints her face (everybody\nknows it)... a creature like that did not think fit to come, and has\nnot even answered the invitation, which the most ordinary good manners\nrequired! I can’t understand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? But\nwhere’s Sonia? Where has she gone? Ah, there she is at last! what is it,\nSonia, where have you been? It’s odd that even at your father’s funeral\nyou should be so unpunctual. Rodion Romanovitch, make room for her\nbeside you. That’s your place, Sonia... take what you like. Have some of\nthe cold entrée with jelly, that’s the best. They’ll bring the pancakes\ndirectly. Have they given the children some? Polenka, have you got\neverything? (Cough-cough-cough.) That’s all right. Be a good girl, Lida,\nand, Kolya, don’t fidget with your feet; sit like a little gentleman.\nWhat are you saying, Sonia?”\n\nSonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitch’s apologies, trying to\nspeak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most\nrespectful phrases which she attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch. She added\nthat Pyotr Petrovitch had particularly told her to say that, as soon as\nhe possibly could, he would come immediately to discuss _business_ alone\nwith her and to consider what could be done for her, etc., etc.\n\nSonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, would flatter her\nand gratify her pride. She sat down beside Raskolnikov; she made him a\nhurried bow, glancing curiously at him. But for the rest of the time\nshe seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him. She seemed\nabsent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, trying\nto please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get\nmourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, and Katerina Ivanovna had on her\nonly dress, a dark striped cotton one.\n\nThe message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful. Listening to\nSonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how\nPyotr Petrovitch was, then at once whispered almost aloud to\nRaskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of\nPyotr Petrovitch’s position and standing to find himself in such\n“extraordinary company,” in spite of his devotion to her family and his\nold friendship with her father.\n\n“That’s why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, that you have\nnot disdained my hospitality, even in such surroundings,” she added\nalmost aloud. “But I am sure that it was only your special affection for\nmy poor husband that has made you keep your promise.”\n\nThen once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors, and\nsuddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man: “Wouldn’t he\nhave some more meat, and had he been given some wine?” The old man made\nno answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked,\nthough his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him. He\nsimply gazed about him with his mouth open, which only increased the\ngeneral mirth.\n\n“What an imbecile! Look, look! Why was he brought? But as to Pyotr\nPetrovitch, I always had confidence in him,” Katerina Ivanovna\ncontinued, “and, of course, he is not like...” with an extremely stern\nface she addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter\nwas quite disconcerted, “not like your dressed up draggletails whom\nmy father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and my late\nhusband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the\ngoodness of his heart.”\n\n“Yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he did drink!” cried the\ncommissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka.\n\n“My late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knows\nit,” Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, “but he was a kind and\nhonourable man, who loved and respected his family. The worst of it was\nhis good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he\ndrank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would you\nbelieve it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread cock in his\npocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget the children!”\n\n“A cock? Did you say a cock?” shouted the commissariat clerk.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply. She sighed, lost in\nthought.\n\n“No doubt you think, like everyone, that I was too severe with him,” she\nwent on, addressing Raskolnikov. “But that’s not so! He respected me, he\nrespected me very much! He was a kind-hearted man! And how sorry I was\nfor him sometimes! He would sit in a corner and look at me, I used to\nfeel so sorry for him, I used to want to be kind to him and then would\nthink to myself: ‘Be kind to him and he will drink again,’ it was only\nby severity that you could keep him within bounds.”\n\n“Yes, he used to get his hair pulled pretty often,” roared the\ncommissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of vodka.\n\n“Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as well as having\ntheir hair pulled. I am not talking of my late husband now!” Katerina\nIvanovna snapped at him.\n\nThe flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her chest heaved. In\nanother minute she would have been ready to make a scene. Many of the\nvisitors were sniggering, evidently delighted. They began poking the\ncommissariat clerk and whispering something to him. They were evidently\ntrying to egg him on.\n\n“Allow me to ask what are you alluding to,” began the clerk, “that is\nto say, whose... about whom... did you say just now... But I don’t care!\nThat’s nonsense! Widow! I forgive you.... Pass!”\n\nAnd he took another drink of vodka.\n\nRaskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust. He only ate from\npoliteness, just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna was continually\nputting on his plate, to avoid hurting her feelings. He watched Sonia\nintently. But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she,\ntoo, foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with\nterror Katerina Ivanovna’s growing irritation. She knew that she, Sonia,\nwas the chief reason for the ‘genteel’ ladies’ contemptuous treatment of\nKaterina Ivanovna’s invitation. She had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that\nthe mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the\nquestion: “How could she let her daughter sit down beside _that young\nperson_?” Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had already heard\nthis and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than an\ninsult to herself, her children, or her father, Sonia knew that\nKaterina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now, “till she had shown those\ndraggletails that they were both...” To make matters worse someone\npassed Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two hearts\npierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread. Katerina Ivanovna flushed\ncrimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it\nwas “a drunken ass!”\n\nAmalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and at the same time\ndeeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna’s haughtiness, and to restore the\ngood-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began,\napropos of nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers “Karl\nfrom the chemist’s,” who was driving one night in a cab, and that “the\ncabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much begged him not to kill,\nand wept and clasped hands, and frightened and from fear pierced his\nheart.” Though Katerina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that\nAmalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter was\nstill more offended, and she retorted that her “_Vater aus Berlin_ was a\nvery important man, and always went with his hands in pockets.” Katerina\nIvanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that Amalia\nIvanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself.\n\n“Listen to the owl!” Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, her\ngood-humour almost restored, “she meant to say he kept his hands in\nhis pockets, but she said he put his hands in people’s pockets.\n(Cough-cough.) And have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that all these\nPetersburg foreigners, the Germans especially, are all stupider than\nwe! Can you fancy anyone of us telling how ‘Karl from the chemist’s’\n‘pierced his heart from fear’ and that the idiot, instead of punishing\nthe cabman, ‘clasped his hands and wept, and much begged.’ Ah, the fool!\nAnd you know she fancies it’s very touching and does not suspect how\nstupid she is! To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great\ndeal cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with\ndrink, but you know, these foreigners are always so well behaved\nand serious.... Look how she sits glaring! She is angry, ha-ha!\n(Cough-cough-cough.)”\n\nRegaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began at once telling\nRaskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension, she intended to open\na school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town T----.\nThis was the first time she had spoken to him of the project, and she\nlaunched out into the most alluring details. It suddenly appeared that\nKaterina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of\nwhich Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern, when he told\nhim that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance\nbefore the governor and other great personages on leaving school. This\ncertificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina\nIvanovna’s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself\nwith it chiefly with the object of overwhelming “those two stuck-up\ndraggletails” if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestably\nthat Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, “she might even say\naristocratic family, a colonel’s daughter and was far superior to\ncertain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late.” The\ncertificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken\nguests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually\ncontained the statement _en toutes lettres_, that her father was of the\nrank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really\nwas almost the daughter of a colonel.\n\nWarming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and\nhappy life they would lead in T----, on the gymnasium teachers whom\nshe would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most\nrespectable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovna\nherself in old days and was still living in T----, and would no doubt\nteach in her school on moderate terms. Next she spoke of Sonia who would\ngo with her to T---- and help her in all her plans. At this someone at\nthe further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw.\n\nThough Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of\nit, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of\nSonia’s undoubted ability to assist her, of “her gentleness, patience,\ndevotion, generosity and good education,” tapping Sonia on the cheek and\nkissing her warmly twice. Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna\nsuddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was “nervous\nand silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and\nas the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea.”\n\nAt that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in\nthe conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort,\nand with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty\nobservation, that “in the future boarding-school she would have to pay\nparticular attention to _die Wäsche_, and that there certainly must be a\ngood _dame_ to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies\nmust not novels at night read.”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very tired, as well as\nheartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, saying\n“she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was the\nbusiness of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class\nboarding-school to look after _die Wäsche_, and as for novel-reading,\nthat was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent.” Amalia\nIvanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only “meant her\ngood,” and that “she had meant her very good,” and that “it was long\nsince she had paid her _gold_ for the lodgings.”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna at once “set her down,” saying that it was a lie to\nsay she wished her good, because only yesterday when her dead husband\nwas lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings. To this\nAmalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those\nladies, but “those ladies had not come, because those ladies _are_\nladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.” Katerina Ivanovna\nat once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judge\nwhat made one really a lady. Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her\n“_Vater aus Berlin_ was a very, very important man, and both hands in\npockets went, and always used to say: ‘Poof! poof!’” and she leapt\nup from the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her\npockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling “poof!\npoof!” amid loud laughter from all the lodgers, who purposely encouraged\nAmalia Ivanovna, hoping for a fight.\n\nBut this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at once declared,\nso that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a\nfather, but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once\nbeen a cook and probably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as red\nas a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a\nfather, “but she had a _Vater aus Berlin_ and that he wore a long coat\nand always said poof-poof-poof!”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family\nwas and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print\nthat her father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna’s father--if she\nreally had one--was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she\nnever had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether her name\nwas Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.\n\nAt this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her fist,\nand shrieked that she was Amalia Ivanovna, and not Ludwigovna, “that\nher _Vater_ was named Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that\nKaterina Ivanovna’s _Vater_ was quite never a burgomeister.” Katerina\nIvanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice\n(though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that “if she\ndared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a\nlevel with her papa, she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her\nhead and trample it under foot.” Amalia Ivanovna ran about the room,\nshouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house and\nthat Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she\nrushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table.\nThere was a great outcry and uproar, the children began crying. Sonia\nran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted\nsomething about “the yellow ticket,” Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia\naway, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat.\n\nAt that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appeared\non the threshold. He stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant\neyes. Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n“Pyotr Petrovitch,” she cried, “protect me... you at least! Make this\nfoolish woman understand that she can’t behave like this to a lady in\nmisfortune... that there is a law for such things.... I’ll go to the\ngovernor-general himself.... She shall answer for it.... Remembering my\nfather’s hospitality protect these orphans.”\n\n“Allow me, madam.... Allow me.” Pyotr Petrovitch waved her off. “Your\npapa as you are well aware I had not the honour of knowing” (someone\nlaughed aloud) “and I do not intend to take part in your everlasting\nsquabbles with Amalia Ivanovna.... I have come here to speak of my own\naffairs... and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya...\nIvanovna, I think it is? Allow me to pass.”\n\nPyotr Petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite corner where Sonia\nwas.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, as though\nthunderstruck. She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could deny\nhaving enjoyed her father’s hospitality. Though she had invented it\nherself, she believed in it firmly by this time. She was struck too\nby the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr\nPetrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his entrance. Not\nonly was this “serious business man” strikingly incongruous with the\nrest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he had come upon some\nmatter of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought him\nand that therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov, standing\nbeside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not\nseem to notice him. A minute later Lebeziatnikov, too, appeared in the\ndoorway; he did not come in, but stood still, listening with marked\ninterest, almost wonder, and seemed for a time perplexed.\n\n“Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it’s a matter of\nsome importance,” Pyotr Petrovitch observed, addressing the company\ngenerally. “I am glad indeed to find other persons present. Amalia\nIvanovna, I humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful\nattention to what I have to say to Sofya Ivanovna. Sofya Ivanovna,”\n he went on, addressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and already\nalarmed, “immediately after your visit I found that a hundred-rouble\nnote was missing from my table, in the room of my friend Mr.\nLebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you know and will tell us where\nit is now, I assure you on my word of honour and call all present to\nwitness that the matter shall end there. In the opposite case I shall be\ncompelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then... you must\nblame yourself.”\n\nComplete silence reigned in the room. Even the crying children were\nstill. Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at Luzhin and unable to say a\nword. She seemed not to understand. Some seconds passed.\n\n“Well, how is it to be then?” asked Luzhin, looking intently at her.\n\n“I don’t know.... I know nothing about it,” Sonia articulated faintly at\nlast.\n\n“No, you know nothing?” Luzhin repeated and again he paused for some\nseconds. “Think a moment, mademoiselle,” he began severely, but still,\nas it were, admonishing her. “Reflect, I am prepared to give you time\nfor consideration. Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirely\nconvinced I should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture to\naccuse you so directly. Seeing that for such direct accusation before\nwitnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should myself in a certain sense\nbe made responsible, I am aware of that. This morning I changed for\nmy own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum of\napproximately three thousand roubles. The account is noted down in my\npocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the money--as Mr.\nLebeziatnikov will bear witness--and after counting two thousand three\nhundred roubles I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket.\nAbout five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three\nnotes of a hundred roubles each. At that moment you entered (at my\ninvitation)--and all the time you were present you were exceedingly\nembarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the\nconversation and tried to make off. Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness\nto this. You yourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm\nmy statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely in\norder to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your\nrelative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I was unable to attend),\nand the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a\nsubscription, lottery or the like, for her benefit. You thanked me and\neven shed tears. I describe all this as it took place, primarily to\nrecall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest\ndetail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten-rouble note from\nthe table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part\nfor the benefit of your relative. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this. Then\nI accompanied you to the door--you being still in the same state of\nembarrassment--after which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I\ntalked to him for ten minutes--then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and I\nreturned to the table with the money lying on it, intending to count\nit and to put it aside, as I proposed doing before. To my surprise one\nhundred-rouble note had disappeared. Kindly consider the position.\nMr. Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such\na supposition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for the\nminute before your entrance I had finished my accounts and found the\ntotal correct. You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment, your\neagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some\ntime on the table, and taking into consideration your social position\nand the habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and\npositively against my will, _compelled_ to entertain a suspicion--a\ncruel, but justifiable suspicion! I will add further and repeat that in\nspite of my positive conviction, I realise that I run a certain risk in\nmaking this accusation, but as you see, I could not let it pass. I have\ntaken action and I will tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing\nto your black ingratitude! Why! I invite you for the benefit of your\ndestitute relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and\nyou, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action. It is too\nbad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Moreover, like a true friend I beg\nyou--and you could have no better friend at this moment--think what you\nare doing, otherwise I shall be immovable! Well, what do you say?”\n\n“I have taken nothing,” Sonia whispered in terror, “you gave me ten\nroubles, here it is, take it.”\n\nSonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied a corner of it,\ntook out the ten-rouble note and gave it to Luzhin.\n\n“And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking?” he insisted\nreproachfully, not taking the note.\n\nSonia looked about her. All were looking at her with such awful, stern,\nironical, hostile eyes. She looked at Raskolnikov... he stood against\nthe wall, with his arms crossed, looking at her with glowing eyes.\n\n“Good God!” broke from Sonia.\n\n“Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the police and therefore\nI humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter,” Luzhin said\nsoftly and even kindly.\n\n“_Gott der Barmherzige_! I knew she was the thief,” cried Amalia\nIvanovna, throwing up her hands.\n\n“You knew it?” Luzhin caught her up, “then I suppose you had some reason\nbefore this for thinking so. I beg you, worthy Amalia Ivanovna, to\nremember your words which have been uttered before witnesses.”\n\nThere was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides. All were in\nmovement.\n\n“What!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the position, and\nshe rushed at Luzhin. “What! You accuse her of stealing? Sonia? Ah, the\nwretches, the wretches!”\n\nAnd running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as\nin a vise.\n\n“Sonia! how dared you take ten roubles from him? Foolish girl! Give it\nto me! Give me the ten roubles at once--here!”\n\nAnd snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up and\nflung it straight into Luzhin’s face. It hit him in the eye and fell\non the ground. Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitch\nlost his temper.\n\n“Hold that mad woman!” he shouted.\n\nAt that moment several other persons, besides Lebeziatnikov, appeared in\nthe doorway, among them the two ladies.\n\n“What! Mad? Am I mad? Idiot!” shrieked Katerina Ivanovna. “You are an\nidiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base man! Sonia, Sonia take his\nmoney! Sonia a thief! Why, she’d give away her last penny!” and Katerina\nIvanovna broke into hysterical laughter. “Did you ever see such an\nidiot?” she turned from side to side. “And you too?” she suddenly saw\nthe landlady, “and you too, sausage eater, you declare that she is a\nthief, you trashy Prussian hen’s leg in a crinoline! She hasn’t been\nout of this room: she came straight from you, you wretch, and sat down\nbeside me, everyone saw her. She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Search\nher! Since she’s not left the room, the money would have to be on her!\nSearch her, search her! But if you don’t find it, then excuse me, my\ndear fellow, you’ll answer for it! I’ll go to our Sovereign, to our\nSovereign, to our gracious Tsar himself, and throw myself at his feet,\nto-day, this minute! I am alone in the world! They would let me in! Do\nyou think they wouldn’t? You’re wrong, I will get in! I will get in!\nYou reckoned on her meekness! You relied upon that! But I am not so\nsubmissive, let me tell you! You’ve gone too far yourself. Search her,\nsearch her!”\n\nAnd Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him towards\nSonia.\n\n“I am ready, I’ll be responsible... but calm yourself, madam, calm\nyourself. I see that you are not so submissive!... Well, well, but as to\nthat...” Luzhin muttered, “that ought to be before the police... though\nindeed there are witnesses enough as it is.... I am ready.... But in\nany case it’s difficult for a man... on account of her sex.... But with\nthe help of Amalia Ivanovna... though, of course, it’s not the way to do\nthings.... How is it to be done?”\n\n“As you will! Let anyone who likes search her!” cried Katerina Ivanovna.\n“Sonia, turn out your pockets! See! Look, monster, the pocket is empty,\nhere was her handkerchief! Here is the other pocket, look! D’you see,\nd’you see?”\n\nAnd Katerina Ivanovna turned--or rather snatched--both pockets inside\nout. But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing\na parabola in the air fell at Luzhin’s feet. Everyone saw it, several\ncried out. Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two\nfingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was a\nhundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held up the note\nshowing it to everyone.\n\n“Thief! Out of my lodging. Police, police!” yelled Amalia Ivanovna.\n“They must to Siberia be sent! Away!”\n\nExclamations arose on all sides. Raskolnikov was silent, keeping his\neyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin.\nSonia stood still, as though unconscious. She was hardly able to feel\nsurprise. Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry\nand hid her face in her hands.\n\n“No, it wasn’t I! I didn’t take it! I know nothing about it,” she cried\nwith a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped\nher tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all the\nworld.\n\n“Sonia! Sonia! I don’t believe it! You see, I don’t believe it!” she\ncried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and fro in her\narms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at her\nhands and kissing them, too, “you took it! How stupid these people are!\nOh dear! You are fools, fools,” she cried, addressing the whole room,\n“you don’t know, you don’t know what a heart she has, what a girl she\nis! She take it, she? She’d sell her last rag, she’d go barefoot to help\nyou if you needed it, that’s what she is! She has the yellow passport\nbecause my children were starving, she sold herself for us! Ah, husband,\nhusband! Do you see? Do you see? What a memorial dinner for you!\nMerciful heavens! Defend her, why are you all standing still? Rodion\nRomanovitch, why don’t you stand up for her? Do you believe it, too? You\nare not worth her little finger, all of you together! Good God! Defend\nher now, at least!”\n\nThe wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce a\ngreat effect on her audience. The agonised, wasted, consumptive face,\nthe parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained\nas a child’s, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help\nwere so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her. Pyotr Petrovitch\nat any rate was at once moved to _compassion_.\n\n“Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!” he cried\nimpressively, “no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an\ninstigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have proved\nher guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previous\nidea of it. I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty,\nso to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse to\nconfess, mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the disgrace? The first step?\nYou lost your head, perhaps? One can quite understand it.... But how\ncould you have lowered yourself to such an action? Gentlemen,” he\naddressed the whole company, “gentlemen! Compassionate and, so to say,\ncommiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even now in spite\nof the personal insult lavished upon me! And may this disgrace be a\nlesson to you for the future,” he said, addressing Sonia, “and I will\ncarry the matter no further. Enough!”\n\nPyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes met, and the\nfire in Raskolnikov’s seemed ready to reduce him to ashes. Meanwhile\nKaterina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing. She was kissing and hugging\nSonia like a madwoman. The children, too, were embracing Sonia on\nall sides, and Polenka--though she did not fully understand what was\nwrong--was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she hid her pretty\nlittle face, swollen with weeping, on Sonia’s shoulder.\n\n“How vile!” a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.\n\nPyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.\n\n“What vileness!” Lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him straight in the\nface.\n\nPyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start--all noticed it and recalled it\nafterwards. Lebeziatnikov strode into the room.\n\n“And you dared to call me as witness?” he said, going up to Pyotr\nPetrovitch.\n\n“What do you mean? What are you talking about?” muttered Luzhin.\n\n“I mean that you... are a slanderer, that’s what my words mean!”\n Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him with his short-sighted\neyes.\n\nHe was extremely angry. Raskolnikov gazed intently at him, as though\nseizing and weighing each word. Again there was a silence. Pyotr\nPetrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment.\n\n“If you mean that for me,...” he began, stammering. “But what’s the\nmatter with you? Are you out of your mind?”\n\n“I’m in my mind, but you are a scoundrel! Ah, how vile! I have heard\neverything. I kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for I must own\neven now it is not quite logical.... What you have done it all for I\ncan’t understand.”\n\n“Why, what have I done then? Give over talking in your nonsensical\nriddles! Or maybe you are drunk!”\n\n“You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not! I never touch\nvodka, for it’s against my convictions. Would you believe it, he, he\nhimself, with his own hands gave Sofya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble\nnote--I saw it, I was a witness, I’ll take my oath! He did it, he!”\n repeated Lebeziatnikov, addressing all.\n\n“Are you crazy, milksop?” squealed Luzhin. “She is herself before\nyou--she herself here declared just now before everyone that I gave her\nonly ten roubles. How could I have given it to her?”\n\n“I saw it, I saw it,” Lebeziatnikov repeated, “and though it is against\nmy principles, I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like\nbefore the court, for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket. Only\nlike a fool I thought you did it out of kindness! When you were saying\ngood-bye to her at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with\nthe other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it, I\nsaw it!”\n\nLuzhin turned pale.\n\n“What lies!” he cried impudently, “why, how could you, standing by the\nwindow, see the note? You fancied it with your short-sighted eyes. You\nare raving!”\n\n“No, I didn’t fancy it. And though I was standing some way off, I saw\nit all. And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from\nthe window--that’s true--I knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble\nnote, because, when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles,\nyou took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it because I\nwas standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that I did not\nforget you had it in your hand). You folded it and kept it in your hand\nall the time. I didn’t think of it again until, when you were getting\nup, you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped\nit! I noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you meant\nto do her a kindness without my seeing. You can fancy how I watched you\nand I saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket. I saw it, I\nsaw it, I’ll take my oath.”\n\nLebeziatnikov was almost breathless. Exclamations arose on all hands\nchiefly expressive of wonder, but some were menacing in tone. They all\ncrowded round Pyotr Petrovitch. Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.\n\n“I was mistaken in you! Protect her! You are the only one to take her\npart! She is an orphan. God has sent you!”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna, hardly knowing what she was doing, sank on her knees\nbefore him.\n\n“A pack of nonsense!” yelled Luzhin, roused to fury, “it’s all nonsense\nyou’ve been talking! ‘An idea struck you, you didn’t think, you\nnoticed’--what does it amount to? So I gave it to her on the sly on\npurpose? What for? With what object? What have I to do with this...?”\n\n“What for? That’s what I can’t understand, but that what I am telling\nyou is the fact, that’s certain! So far from my being mistaken, you\ninfamous criminal man, I remember how, on account of it, a question\noccurred to me at once, just when I was thanking you and pressing\nyour hand. What made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did it\nsecretly, I mean? Could it be simply to conceal it from me, knowing that\nmy convictions are opposed to yours and that I do not approve of private\nbenevolence, which effects no radical cure? Well, I decided that you\nreally were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me. Perhaps,\ntoo, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she finds a whole\nhundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I know, some benevolent people\nare very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.) Then\nthe idea struck me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether,\nwhen she found it, she would come to thank you. Then, too, that you\nwanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your right hand\nshould not know... something of that sort, in fact. I thought of so\nmany possibilities that I put off considering it, but still thought it\nindelicate to show you that I knew your secret. But another idea struck\nme again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she\nnoticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call her out of\nthe room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket.\nBut on my way I went first to Madame Kobilatnikov’s to take them the\n‘General Treatise on the Positive Method’ and especially to recommend\nPiderit’s article (and also Wagner’s); then I come on here and what a\nstate of things I find! Now could I, could I, have all these ideas and\nreflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-rouble note in her\npocket?”\n\nWhen Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue with the logical\ndeduction at the end, he was quite tired, and the perspiration streamed\nfrom his face. He could not, alas, even express himself correctly\nin Russian, though he knew no other language, so that he was quite\nexhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit. But his speech\nproduced a powerful effect. He had spoken with such vehemence, with such\nconviction that everyone obviously believed him. Pyotr Petrovitch felt\nthat things were going badly with him.\n\n“What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?” he shouted,\n“that’s no evidence. You may have dreamt it, that’s all! And I tell you,\nyou are lying, sir. You are lying and slandering from some spite against\nme, simply from pique, because I did not agree with your free-thinking,\ngodless, social propositions!”\n\nBut this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch. Murmurs of disapproval\nwere heard on all sides.\n\n“Ah, that’s your line now, is it!” cried Lebeziatnikov, “that’s\nnonsense! Call the police and I’ll take my oath! There’s only one thing\nI can’t understand: what made him risk such a contemptible action. Oh,\npitiful, despicable man!”\n\n“I can explain why he risked such an action, and if necessary, I, too,\nwill swear to it,” Raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice, and he\nstepped forward.\n\nHe appeared to be firm and composed. Everyone felt clearly, from the\nvery look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would\nbe solved.\n\n“Now I can explain it all to myself,” said Raskolnikov, addressing\nLebeziatnikov. “From the very beginning of the business, I suspected\nthat there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it. I began\nto suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only, which\nI will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything. Your\nvaluable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I beg all,\nall to listen. This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) was recently\nengaged to be married to a young lady--my sister, Avdotya Romanovna\nRaskolnikov. But coming to Petersburg he quarrelled with me, the day\nbefore yesterday, at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room--I\nhave two witnesses to prove it. He is a very spiteful man.... The day\nbefore yesterday I did not know that he was staying here, in your room,\nand that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day before\nyesterday--he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral,\nas a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He at once wrote a note to\nmy mother and informed her that I had given away all my money, not\nto Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a most\ncontemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is,\nhinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this you\nunderstand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister,\nby insinuating that I was squandering on unworthy objects the money\nwhich they had sent me and which was all they had. Yesterday evening,\nbefore my mother and sister and in his presence, I declared that I had\ngiven the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to Sofya\nSemyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had\nnever seen her before, indeed. At the same time I added that he,\nPyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with all his virtues, was not worth Sofya\nSemyonovna’s little finger, though he spoke so ill of her. To his\nquestion--would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I\nanswered that I had already done so that day. Irritated that my mother\nand sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations, he\ngradually began being unpardonably rude to them. A final rupture took\nplace and he was turned out of the house. All this happened yesterday\nevening. Now I beg your special attention: consider: if he had now\nsucceeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would\nhave shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his\nsuspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on\na level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he was protecting\nand preserving the honour of my sister, his betrothed. In fact he might\neven, through all this, have been able to estrange me from my family,\nand no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothing\nof revenging himself on me personally, for he has grounds for supposing\nthat the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to\nme. That was what he was working for! That’s how I understand it. That’s\nthe whole reason for it and there can be no other!”\n\nIt was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov wound up his\nspeech which was followed very attentively, though often interrupted by\nexclamations from his audience. But in spite of interruptions he spoke\nclearly, calmly, exactly, firmly. His decisive voice, his tone of\nconviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone.\n\n“Yes, yes, that’s it,” Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, “that must be\nit, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room,\nwhether you were here, whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna’s\nguests. He called me aside to the window and asked me in secret. It was\nessential for him that you should be here! That’s it, that’s it!”\n\nLuzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But he was very pale. He\nseemed to be deliberating on some means of escape. Perhaps he would have\nbeen glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment this\nwas scarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth of\nthe accusations brought against him. Moreover, the company, which had\nalready been excited by drink, was now too much stirred to allow it. The\ncommissariat clerk, though indeed he had not grasped the whole position,\nwas shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very\nunpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; lodgers came\nin from all the rooms. The three Poles were tremendously excited\nand were continually shouting at him: “The _pan_ is a _lajdak_!” and\nmuttering threats in Polish. Sonia had been listening with strained\nattention, though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as\nthough she had just returned to consciousness. She did not take her\neyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him. Katerina\nIvanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted.\nAmalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her mouth\nwide open, unable to make out what had happened. She only saw that Pyotr\nPetrovitch had somehow come to grief.\n\nRaskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him.\nEveryone was crowding round Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse.\nBut Pyotr Petrovitch was not intimidated. Seeing that his accusation of\nSonia had completely failed, he had recourse to insolence:\n\n“Allow me, gentlemen, allow me! Don’t squeeze, let me pass!” he said,\nmaking his way through the crowd. “And no threats, if you please! I\nassure you it will be useless, you will gain nothing by it. On the\ncontrary, you’ll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing\nthe course of justice. The thief has been more than unmasked, and I\nshall prosecute. Our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk, and\nwill not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, and\natheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are\nfoolish enough to admit.... Yes, allow me to pass!”\n\n“Don’t let me find a trace of you in my room! Kindly leave at once, and\neverything is at an end between us! When I think of the trouble I’ve\nbeen taking, the way I’ve been expounding... all this fortnight!”\n\n“I told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried to keep me;\nnow I will simply add that you are a fool. I advise you to see a doctor\nfor your brains and your short sight. Let me pass, gentlemen!”\n\nHe forced his way through. But the commissariat clerk was unwilling to\nlet him off so easily: he picked up a glass from the table, brandished\nit in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch; but the glass flew\nstraight at Amalia Ivanovna. She screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing,\nfell heavily under the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room\nand half an hour later had left the house. Sonia, timid by nature, had\nfelt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily than\nanyone, and that she could be wronged with impunity. Yet till that\nmoment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care,\ngentleness and submissiveness before everyone. Her disappointment was\ntoo great. She could, of course, bear with patience and almost without\nmurmur anything, even this. But for the first minute she felt it too\nbitter. In spite of her triumph and her justification--when her first\nterror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all\nclearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her\nmade her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical\nweeping. At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out of the room\nand ran home, almost immediately after Luzhin’s departure. When amidst\nloud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the\nlandlady could endure. With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina\nIvanovna, considering her to blame for everything.\n\n“Out of my lodgings! At once! Quick march!”\n\nAnd with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay\nher hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it on the\nfloor. Katerina Ivanovna, pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath,\njumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at\nAmalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her\naway like a feather.\n\n“What! As though that godless calumny was not enough--this vile creature\nattacks me! What! On the day of my husband’s funeral I am turned out of\nmy lodging! After eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street,\nwith my orphans! Where am I to go?” wailed the poor woman, sobbing and\ngasping. “Good God!” she cried with flashing eyes, “is there no justice\nupon earth? Whom should you protect if not us orphans? We shall see!\nThere is law and justice on earth, there is, I will find it! Wait a bit,\ngodless creature! Polenka, stay with the children, I’ll come back. Wait\nfor me, if you have to wait in the street. We will see whether there is\njustice on earth!”\n\nAnd throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had\nmentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the\ndisorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and,\nwailing and tearful, she ran into the street--with a vague intention\nof going at once somewhere to find justice. Polenka with the two little\nones in her arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of the\nroom, where she waited trembling for her mother to come back. Amalia\nIvanovna raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing\neverything she came across on the floor. The lodgers talked\nincoherently, some commented to the best of their ability on what had\nhappened, others quarrelled and swore at one another, while others\nstruck up a song....\n\n“Now it’s time for me to go,” thought Raskolnikov. “Well, Sofya\nSemyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!”\n\nAnd he set off in the direction of Sonia’s lodgings.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nRaskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against\nLuzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own\nheart. But having gone through so much in the morning, he found a sort\nof relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal\nfeeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agitated too,\nespecially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interview\nwith Sonia: he _had_ to tell her who had killed Lizaveta. He knew the\nterrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the\nthought of it. So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna’s, “Well,\nSofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!” he was still\nsuperficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over\nLuzhin. But, strange to say, by the time he reached Sonia’s lodging, he\nfelt a sudden impotence and fear. He stood still in hesitation at the\ndoor, asking himself the strange question: “Must he tell her who killed\nLizaveta?” It was a strange question because he felt at the very time\nnot only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could\nnot put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be so, he\nonly _felt_ it, and the agonising sense of his impotence before\nthe inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his hesitation and\nsuffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the\ndoorway. She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in\nher hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet\nhim as though she were expecting him.\n\n“What would have become of me but for you?” she said quickly, meeting\nhim in the middle of the room.\n\nEvidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what she had been\nwaiting for.\n\nRaskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she\nhad only just risen. She stood facing him, two steps away, just as she\nhad done the day before.\n\n“Well, Sonia?” he said, and felt that his voice was trembling, “it was\nall due to ‘your social position and the habits associated with it.’ Did\nyou understand that just now?”\n\nHer face showed her distress.\n\n“Only don’t talk to me as you did yesterday,” she interrupted him.\n“Please don’t begin it. There is misery enough without that.”\n\nShe made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like the reproach.\n\n“I was silly to come away from there. What is happening there now? I\nwanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking that... you would come.”\n\nHe told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging\nand that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere “to seek justice.”\n\n“My God!” cried Sonia, “let’s go at once....”\n\nAnd she snatched up her cape.\n\n“It’s everlastingly the same thing!” said Raskolnikov, irritably.\n“You’ve no thought except for them! Stay a little with me.”\n\n“But... Katerina Ivanovna?”\n\n“You won’t lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, she’ll come to you\nherself since she has run out,” he added peevishly. “If she doesn’t find\nyou here, you’ll be blamed for it....”\n\nSonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was silent, gazing at\nthe floor and deliberating.\n\n“This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you,” he began, not looking\nat Sonia, “but if he had wanted to, if it had suited his plans, he would\nhave sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me.\nAh?”\n\n“Yes,” she assented in a faint voice. “Yes,” she repeated, preoccupied\nand distressed.\n\n“But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite an accident\nLebeziatnikov’s turning up.”\n\nSonia was silent.\n\n“And if you’d gone to prison, what then? Do you remember what I said\nyesterday?”\n\nAgain she did not answer. He waited.\n\n“I thought you would cry out again ‘don’t speak of it, leave off.’”\n Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. “What, silence\nagain?” he asked a minute later. “We must talk about something, you\nknow. It would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a\ncertain ‘problem’ as Lebeziatnikov would say.” (He was beginning to lose\nthe thread.) “No, really, I am serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you had\nknown all Luzhin’s intentions beforehand. Known, that is, for a fact,\nthat they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the children and\nyourself thrown in--since you don’t count yourself for anything--Polenka\ntoo... for she’ll go the same way. Well, if suddenly it all depended on\nyour decision whether he or they should go on living, that is whether\nLuzhin should go on living and doing wicked things, or Katerina Ivanovna\nshould die? How would you decide which of them was to die? I ask you?”\n\nSonia looked uneasily at him. There was something peculiar in this\nhesitating question, which seemed approaching something in a roundabout\nway.\n\n“I felt that you were going to ask some question like that,” she said,\nlooking inquisitively at him.\n\n“I dare say you did. But how is it to be answered?”\n\n“Why do you ask about what could not happen?” said Sonia reluctantly.\n\n“Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and doing wicked\nthings? You haven’t dared to decide even that!”\n\n“But I can’t know the Divine Providence.... And why do you ask what\ncan’t be answered? What’s the use of such foolish questions? How could\nit happen that it should depend on my decision--who has made me a judge\nto decide who is to live and who is not to live?”\n\n“Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there is no doing\nanything,” Raskolnikov grumbled morosely.\n\n“You’d better say straight out what you want!” Sonia cried in distress.\n“You are leading up to something again.... Can you have come simply to\ntorture me?”\n\nShe could not control herself and began crying bitterly. He looked at\nher in gloomy misery. Five minutes passed.\n\n“Of course you’re right, Sonia,” he said softly at last. He was suddenly\nchanged. His tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone.\nEven his voice was suddenly weak. “I told you yesterday that I was not\ncoming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing I’ve said is to ask\nforgiveness.... I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake.\nI was asking forgiveness, Sonia....”\n\nHe tried to smile, but there was something helpless and incomplete in\nhis pale smile. He bowed his head and hid his face in his hands.\n\nAnd suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred\nfor Sonia passed through his heart. As it were wondering and frightened\nof this sensation, he raised his head and looked intently at her; but he\nmet her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was\nlove in them; his hatred vanished like a phantom. It was not the real\nfeeling; he had taken the one feeling for the other. It only meant that\n_that_ minute had come.\n\nHe hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. Suddenly he\nturned pale, got up from his chair, looked at Sonia, and without\nuttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed.\n\nHis sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he had\nstood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that “he must\nnot lose another minute.”\n\n“What’s the matter?” asked Sonia, dreadfully frightened.\n\nHe could not utter a word. This was not at all, not at all the way he\nhad intended to “tell” and he did not understand what was happening to\nhim now. She went up to him, softly, sat down on the bed beside him and\nwaited, not taking her eyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. It\nwas unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked,\nhelplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror passed\nthrough Sonia’s heart.\n\n“What’s the matter?” she repeated, drawing a little away from him.\n\n“Nothing, Sonia, don’t be frightened.... It’s nonsense. It really is\nnonsense, if you think of it,” he muttered, like a man in delirium. “Why\nhave I come to torture you?” he added suddenly, looking at her. “Why,\nreally? I keep asking myself that question, Sonia....”\n\nHe had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour\nbefore, but now he spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he said and\nfeeling a continual tremor all over.\n\n“Oh, how you are suffering!” she muttered in distress, looking intently\nat him.\n\n“It’s all nonsense.... Listen, Sonia.” He suddenly smiled, a pale\nhelpless smile for two seconds. “You remember what I meant to tell you\nyesterday?”\n\nSonia waited uneasily.\n\n“I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye for ever, but\nthat if I came to-day I would tell you who... who killed Lizaveta.”\n\nShe began trembling all over.\n\n“Well, here I’ve come to tell you.”\n\n“Then you really meant it yesterday?” she whispered with difficulty.\n“How do you know?” she asked quickly, as though suddenly regaining her\nreason.\n\nSonia’s face grew paler and paler, and she breathed painfully.\n\n“I know.”\n\nShe paused a minute.\n\n“Have they found him?” she asked timidly.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then how do you know about _it_?” she asked again, hardly audibly and\nagain after a minute’s pause.\n\nHe turned to her and looked very intently at her.\n\n“Guess,” he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.\n\nA shudder passed over her.\n\n“But you... why do you frighten me like this?” she said, smiling like a\nchild.\n\n“I must be a great friend of _his_... since I know,” Raskolnikov went\non, still gazing into her face, as though he could not turn his eyes\naway. “He... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he... killed her\naccidentally.... He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and\nhe went there... and then Lizaveta came in... he killed her too.”\n\nAnother awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one another.\n\n“You can’t guess, then?” he asked suddenly, feeling as though he were\nflinging himself down from a steeple.\n\n“N-no...” whispered Sonia.\n\n“Take a good look.”\n\nAs soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his\nheart. He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the\nface of Lizaveta. He remembered clearly the expression in Lizaveta’s\nface, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the\nwall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking\nas little children do when they begin to be frightened of something,\nlooking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and\nholding out their little hands on the point of crying. Almost the same\nthing happened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the same\nterror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left\nhand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to\nget up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed\neven more immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear\nshowed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her and almost\nwith the same _childish_ smile.\n\n“Have you guessed?” he whispered at last.\n\n“Good God!” broke in an awful wail from her bosom.\n\nShe sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but a\nmoment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his hands\nand, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into his\nface again with the same intent stare. In this last desperate look she\ntried to look into him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope;\nthere was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, when\nshe recalled that moment, she thought it strange and wondered why she\nhad seen at once that there was no doubt. She could not have said, for\ninstance, that she had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now, as\nsoon as he told her, she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen\nthis very thing.\n\n“Stop, Sonia, enough! don’t torture me,” he begged her miserably.\n\nIt was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her,\nbut this is how it happened.\n\nShe jumped up, seeming not to know what she was doing, and, wringing her\nhands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat\ndown again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden\nshe started as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on\nher knees before him, she did not know why.\n\n“What have you done--what have you done to yourself?” she said in\ndespair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on his neck, threw her arms\nround him, and held him tightly.\n\nRaskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile.\n\n“You are a strange girl, Sonia--you kiss me and hug me when I tell you\nabout that.... You don’t think what you are doing.”\n\n“There is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!” she\ncried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke into\nviolent hysterical weeping.\n\nA feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at\nonce. He did not struggle against it. Two tears started into his eyes\nand hung on his eyelashes.\n\n“Then you won’t leave me, Sonia?” he said, looking at her almost with\nhope.\n\n“No, no, never, nowhere!” cried Sonia. “I will follow you, I will follow\nyou everywhere. Oh, my God! Oh, how miserable I am!... Why, why didn’t I\nknow you before! Why didn’t you come before? Oh, dear!”\n\n“Here I have come.”\n\n“Yes, now! What’s to be done now?... Together, together!” she repeated\nas it were unconsciously, and she hugged him again. “I’ll follow you to\nSiberia!”\n\nHe recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to\nhis lips.\n\n“Perhaps I don’t want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia,” he said.\n\nSonia looked at him quickly.\n\nAgain after her first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy man\nthe terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her. In his changed tone she\nseemed to hear the murderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She\nknew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. Now all\nthese questions rushed at once into her mind. And again she could not\nbelieve it: “He, he is a murderer! Could it be true?”\n\n“What’s the meaning of it? Where am I?” she said in complete\nbewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. “How could you,\nyou, a man like you.... How could you bring yourself to it?... What does\nit mean?”\n\n“Oh, well--to plunder. Leave off, Sonia,” he answered wearily, almost\nwith vexation.\n\nSonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she cried:\n\n“You were hungry! It was... to help your mother? Yes?”\n\n“No, Sonia, no,” he muttered, turning away and hanging his head. “I was\nnot so hungry.... I certainly did want to help my mother, but... that’s\nnot the real thing either.... Don’t torture me, Sonia.”\n\nSonia clasped her hands.\n\n“Could it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! Who could\nbelieve it? And how could you give away your last farthing and yet\nrob and murder! Ah,” she cried suddenly, “that money you gave Katerina\nIvanovna... that money.... Can that money...”\n\n“No, Sonia,” he broke in hurriedly, “that money was not it. Don’t worry\nyourself! That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, the\nday I gave it to you.... Razumihin saw it... he received it for me....\nThat money was mine--my own.”\n\nSonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend.\n\n“And _that_ money.... I don’t even know really whether there was any\nmoney,” he added softly, as though reflecting. “I took a purse off her\nneck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something...\nbut I didn’t look in it; I suppose I hadn’t time.... And the\nthings--chains and trinkets--I buried under a stone with the purse next\nmorning in a yard off the V---- Prospect. They are all there now....”\n\nSonia strained every nerve to listen.\n\n“Then why... why, you said you did it to rob, but you took nothing?” she\nasked quickly, catching at a straw.\n\n“I don’t know.... I haven’t yet decided whether to take that money or\nnot,” he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake up with a start, he\ngave a brief ironical smile. “Ach, what silly stuff I am talking, eh?”\n\nThe thought flashed through Sonia’s mind, wasn’t he mad? But she\ndismissed it at once. “No, it was something else.” She could make\nnothing of it, nothing.\n\n“Do you know, Sonia,” he said suddenly with conviction, “let me tell\nyou: if I’d simply killed because I was hungry,” laying stress on\nevery word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, “I should\nbe _happy_ now. You must believe that! What would it matter to you,” he\ncried a moment later with a sort of despair, “what would it matter to\nyou if I were to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such\na stupid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that I’ve come to you\nto-day?”\n\nAgain Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.\n\n“I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left.”\n\n“Go where?” asked Sonia timidly.\n\n“Not to steal and not to murder, don’t be anxious,” he smiled bitterly.\n“We are so different.... And you know, Sonia, it’s only now, only this\nmoment that I understand _where_ I asked you to go with me yesterday!\nYesterday when I said it I did not know where. I asked you for one\nthing, I came to you for one thing--not to leave me. You won’t leave me,\nSonia?”\n\nShe squeezed his hand.\n\n“And why, why did I tell her? Why did I let her know?” he cried a minute\nlater in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her. “Here you expect\nan explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see\nthat. But what can I tell you? You won’t understand and will only suffer\nmisery... on my account! Well, you are crying and embracing me again.\nWhy do you do it? Because I couldn’t bear my burden and have come to\nthrow it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better! And can\nyou love such a mean wretch?”\n\n“But aren’t you suffering, too?” cried Sonia.\n\nAgain a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, and again for an\ninstant softened it.\n\n“Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a great\ndeal. I have come because I am bad. There are men who wouldn’t have\ncome. But I am a coward and... a mean wretch. But... never mind! That’s\nnot the point. I must speak now, but I don’t know how to begin.”\n\nHe paused and sank into thought.\n\n“Ach, we are so different,” he cried again, “we are not alike. And why,\nwhy did I come? I shall never forgive myself that.”\n\n“No, no, it was a good thing you came,” cried Sonia. “It’s better I\nshould know, far better!”\n\nHe looked at her with anguish.\n\n“What if it were really that?” he said, as though reaching a conclusion.\n“Yes, that’s what it was! I wanted to become a Napoleon, that is why I\nkilled her.... Do you understand now?”\n\n“N-no,” Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly. “Only speak, speak, I shall\nunderstand, I shall understand _in myself_!” she kept begging him.\n\n“You’ll understand? Very well, we shall see!” He paused and was for some\ntime lost in meditation.\n\n“It was like this: I asked myself one day this question--what if\nNapoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he had\nnot had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his\ncareer with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things,\nthere had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who had\nto be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career, you\nunderstand). Well, would he have brought himself to that if there had\nbeen no other means? Wouldn’t he have felt a pang at its being so far\nfrom monumental and... and sinful, too? Well, I must tell you that I\nworried myself fearfully over that ‘question’ so that I was awfully\nashamed when I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it would\nnot have given him the least pang, that it would not even have struck\nhim that it was not monumental... that he would not have seen that there\nwas anything in it to pause over, and that, if he had had no other way,\nhe would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it!\nWell, I too... left off thinking about it... murdered her, following\nhis example. And that’s exactly how it was! Do you think it funny? Yes,\nSonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that’s just how it\nwas.”\n\nSonia did not think it at all funny.\n\n“You had better tell me straight out... without examples,” she begged,\nstill more timidly and scarcely audibly.\n\nHe turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her hands.\n\n“You are right again, Sonia. Of course that’s all nonsense, it’s almost\nall talk! You see, you know of course that my mother has scarcely\nanything, my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned\nto drudge as a governess. All their hopes were centered on me. I was a\nstudent, but I couldn’t keep myself at the university and was forced\nfor a time to leave it. Even if I had lingered on like that, in ten\nor twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some sort of teacher or\nclerk with a salary of a thousand roubles” (he repeated it as though it\nwere a lesson) “and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief\nand anxiety and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my\nsister... well, my sister might well have fared worse! And it’s a hard\nthing to pass everything by all one’s life, to turn one’s back upon\neverything, to forget one’s mother and decorously accept the insults\ninflicted on one’s sister. Why should one? When one has buried them to\nburden oneself with others--wife and children--and to leave them again\nwithout a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the old woman’s\nmoney and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother,\nto keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving\nit--and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up\na completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....\nWell... that’s all.... Well, of course in killing the old woman I did\nwrong.... Well, that’s enough.”\n\nHe struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head\nsink.\n\n“Oh, that’s not it, that’s not it,” Sonia cried in distress. “How could\none... no, that’s not right, not right.”\n\n“You see yourself that it’s not right. But I’ve spoken truly, it’s the\ntruth.”\n\n“As though that could be the truth! Good God!”\n\n“I’ve only killed a louse, Sonia, a useless, loathsome, harmful\ncreature.”\n\n“A human being--a louse!”\n\n“I too know it wasn’t a louse,” he answered, looking strangely at\nher. “But I am talking nonsense, Sonia,” he added. “I’ve been talking\nnonsense a long time.... That’s not it, you are right there. There were\nquite, quite other causes for it! I haven’t talked to anyone for so\nlong, Sonia.... My head aches dreadfully now.”\n\nHis eyes shone with feverish brilliance. He was almost delirious; an\nuneasy smile strayed on his lips. His terrible exhaustion could be seen\nthrough his excitement. Sonia saw how he was suffering. She too\nwas growing dizzy. And he talked so strangely; it seemed somehow\ncomprehensible, but yet... “But how, how! Good God!” And she wrung her\nhands in despair.\n\n“No, Sonia, that’s not it,” he began again suddenly, raising his head,\nas though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were\nroused him--“that’s not it! Better... imagine--yes, it’s certainly\nbetter--imagine that I am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictive\nand... well, perhaps with a tendency to insanity. (Let’s have it all out\nat once! They’ve talked of madness already, I noticed.) I told you just\nnow I could not keep myself at the university. But do you know that\nperhaps I might have done? My mother would have sent me what I needed\nfor the fees and I could have earned enough for clothes, boots and food,\nno doubt. Lessons had turned up at half a rouble. Razumihin works! But I\nturned sulky and wouldn’t. (Yes, sulkiness, that’s the right word for\nit!) I sat in my room like a spider. You’ve been in my den, you’ve seen\nit.... And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp\nthe soul and the mind? Ah, how I hated that garret! And yet I wouldn’t\ngo out of it! I wouldn’t on purpose! I didn’t go out for days together,\nand I wouldn’t work, I wouldn’t even eat, I just lay there doing\nnothing. If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she didn’t, I\nwent all day without; I wouldn’t ask, on purpose, from sulkiness! At\nnight I had no light, I lay in the dark and I wouldn’t earn money for\ncandles. I ought to have studied, but I sold my books; and the dust lies\nan inch thick on the notebooks on my table. I preferred lying still and\nthinking. And I kept thinking.... And I had dreams all the time, strange\ndreams of all sorts, no need to describe! Only then I began to fancy\nthat... No, that’s not it! Again I am telling you wrong! You see I kept\nasking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid--and I\nknow they are--yet I won’t be wiser? Then I saw, Sonia, that if one\nwaits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long.... Afterwards I\nunderstood that that would never come to pass, that men won’t change and\nthat nobody can alter it and that it’s not worth wasting effort over it.\nYes, that’s so. That’s the law of their nature, Sonia,... that’s so!...\nAnd I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will\nhave power over them. Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their\neyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he\nwho dares most of all will be most in the right! So it has been till now\nand so it will always be. A man must be blind not to see it!”\n\nThough Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, he no longer cared\nwhether she understood or not. The fever had complete hold of him; he\nwas in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he certainly had been too long without\ntalking to anyone). Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his\nfaith and code.\n\n“I divined then, Sonia,” he went on eagerly, “that power is only\nvouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up. There is only\none thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare! Then for the first\ntime in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever\nthought of before me, no one! I saw clear as daylight how strange it is\nthat not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to\ngo straight for it all and send it flying to the devil! I... I wanted\n_to have the daring_... and I killed her. I only wanted to have the\ndaring, Sonia! That was the whole cause of it!”\n\n“Oh hush, hush,” cried Sonia, clasping her hands. “You turned away from\nGod and God has smitten you, has given you over to the devil!”\n\n“Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all this became\nclear to me, was it a temptation of the devil, eh?”\n\n“Hush, don’t laugh, blasphemer! You don’t understand, you don’t\nunderstand! Oh God! He won’t understand!”\n\n“Hush, Sonia! I am not laughing. I know myself that it was the devil\nleading me. Hush, Sonia, hush!” he repeated with gloomy insistence. “I\nknow it all, I have thought it all over and over and whispered it all\nover to myself, lying there in the dark.... I’ve argued it all over with\nmyself, every point of it, and I know it all, all! And how sick, how\nsick I was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget it\nand make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off thinking. And you don’t\nsuppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like a\nwise man, and that was just my destruction. And you mustn’t suppose that\nI didn’t know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether\nI had the right to gain power--I certainly hadn’t the right--or that if\nI asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn’t\nso for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his\ngoal without asking questions.... If I worried myself all those days,\nwondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly\nof course that I wasn’t Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony of that\nbattle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder\nwithout casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone! I didn’t\nwant to lie about it even to myself. It wasn’t to help my mother I did\nthe murder--that’s nonsense--I didn’t do the murder to gain wealth and\npower and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I simply did it;\nI did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a\nbenefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men in\nmy web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn’t have cared at that\nmoment.... And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It\nwas not so much the money I wanted, but something else.... I know it all\nnow.... Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder\nagain. I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led\nme on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse\nlike everybody else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or\nnot, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling\ncreature or whether I have the _right_...”\n\n“To kill? Have the right to kill?” Sonia clasped her hands.\n\n“Ach, Sonia!” he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort,\nbut was contemptuously silent. “Don’t interrupt me, Sonia. I want to\nprove one thing only, that the devil led me on then and he has shown me\nsince that I had not the right to take that path, because I am just such\na louse as all the rest. He was mocking me and here I’ve come to you\nnow! Welcome your guest! If I were not a louse, should I have come to\nyou? Listen: when I went then to the old woman’s I only went to\n_try_.... You may be sure of that!”\n\n“And you murdered her!”\n\n“But how did I murder her? Is that how men do murders? Do men go to\ncommit a murder as I went then? I will tell you some day how I went!\nDid I murder the old woman? I murdered myself, not her! I crushed myself\nonce for all, for ever.... But it was the devil that killed that old\nwoman, not I. Enough, enough, Sonia, enough! Let me be!” he cried in a\nsudden spasm of agony, “let me be!”\n\nHe leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands as\nin a vise.\n\n“What suffering!” A wail of anguish broke from Sonia.\n\n“Well, what am I to do now?” he asked, suddenly raising his head and\nlooking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair.\n\n“What are you to do?” she cried, jumping up, and her eyes that had been\nfull of tears suddenly began to shine. “Stand up!” (She seized him by\nthe shoulder, he got up, looking at her almost bewildered.) “Go at once,\nthis very minute, stand at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the\nearth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say\nto all men aloud, ‘I am a murderer!’ Then God will send you life again.\nWill you go, will you go?” she asked him, trembling all over, snatching\nhis two hands, squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes\nfull of fire.\n\nHe was amazed at her sudden ecstasy.\n\n“You mean Siberia, Sonia? I must give myself up?” he asked gloomily.\n\n“Suffer and expiate your sin by it, that’s what you must do.”\n\n“No! I am not going to them, Sonia!”\n\n“But how will you go on living? What will you live for?” cried Sonia,\n“how is it possible now? Why, how can you talk to your mother? (Oh, what\nwill become of them now?) But what am I saying? You have abandoned your\nmother and your sister already. He has abandoned them already! Oh,\nGod!” she cried, “why, he knows it all himself. How, how can he live by\nhimself! What will become of you now?”\n\n“Don’t be a child, Sonia,” he said softly. “What wrong have I done\nthem? Why should I go to them? What should I say to them? That’s only a\nphantom.... They destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a\nvirtue. They are knaves and scoundrels, Sonia! I am not going to them.\nAnd what should I say to them--that I murdered her, but did not dare to\ntake the money and hid it under a stone?” he added with a bitter smile.\n“Why, they would laugh at me, and would call me a fool for not getting\nit. A coward and a fool! They wouldn’t understand and they don’t deserve\nto understand. Why should I go to them? I won’t. Don’t be a child,\nSonia....”\n\n“It will be too much for you to bear, too much!” she repeated, holding\nout her hands in despairing supplication.\n\n“Perhaps I’ve been unfair to myself,” he observed gloomily, pondering,\n“perhaps after all I am a man and not a louse and I’ve been in too great\na hurry to condemn myself. I’ll make another fight for it.”\n\nA haughty smile appeared on his lips.\n\n“What a burden to bear! And your whole life, your whole life!”\n\n“I shall get used to it,” he said grimly and thoughtfully. “Listen,” he\nbegan a minute later, “stop crying, it’s time to talk of the facts: I’ve\ncome to tell you that the police are after me, on my track....”\n\n“Ach!” Sonia cried in terror.\n\n“Well, why do you cry out? You want me to go to Siberia and now you are\nfrightened? But let me tell you: I shall not give myself up. I shall\nmake a struggle for it and they won’t do anything to me. They’ve no real\nevidence. Yesterday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but\nto-day things are going better. All the facts they know can be explained\ntwo ways, that’s to say I can turn their accusations to my credit, do\nyou understand? And I shall, for I’ve learnt my lesson. But they will\ncertainly arrest me. If it had not been for something that happened,\nthey would have done so to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will\narrest me to-day.... But that’s no matter, Sonia; they’ll let me out\nagain... for there isn’t any real proof against me, and there won’t be,\nI give you my word for it. And they can’t convict a man on what they\nhave against me. Enough.... I only tell you that you may know.... I will\ntry to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that they\nwon’t be frightened.... My sister’s future is secure, however, now, I\nbelieve... and my mother’s must be too.... Well, that’s all. Be careful,\nthough. Will you come and see me in prison when I am there?”\n\n“Oh, I will, I will.”\n\nThey sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as though they had\nbeen cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore. He looked at\nSonia and felt how great was her love for him, and strange to say he\nfelt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved. Yes, it was a\nstrange and awful sensation! On his way to see Sonia he had felt that\nall his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least part\nof his suffering, and now, when all her heart turned towards him, he\nsuddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before.\n\n“Sonia,” he said, “you’d better not come and see me when I am in\nprison.”\n\nSonia did not answer, she was crying. Several minutes passed.\n\n“Have you a cross on you?” she asked, as though suddenly thinking of it.\n\nHe did not at first understand the question.\n\n“No, of course not. Here, take this one, of cypress wood. I have\nanother, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta. I changed with\nLizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her my little ikon. I will\nwear Lizaveta’s now and give you this. Take it... it’s mine! It’s mine,\nyou know,” she begged him. “We will go to suffer together, and together\nwe will bear our cross!”\n\n“Give it me,” said Raskolnikov.\n\nHe did not want to hurt her feelings. But immediately he drew back the\nhand he held out for the cross.\n\n“Not now, Sonia. Better later,” he added to comfort her.\n\n“Yes, yes, better,” she repeated with conviction, “when you go to meet\nyour suffering, then put it on. You will come to me, I’ll put it on you,\nwe will pray and go together.”\n\nAt that moment someone knocked three times at the door.\n\n“Sofya Semyonovna, may I come in?” they heard in a very familiar and\npolite voice.\n\nSonia rushed to the door in a fright. The flaxen head of Mr.\nLebeziatnikov appeared at the door.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nLebeziatnikov looked perturbed.\n\n“I’ve come to you, Sofya Semyonovna,” he began. “Excuse me... I thought\nI should find you,” he said, addressing Raskolnikov suddenly, “that is,\nI didn’t mean anything... of that sort... But I just thought... Katerina\nIvanovna has gone out of her mind,” he blurted out suddenly, turning\nfrom Raskolnikov to Sonia.\n\nSonia screamed.\n\n“At least it seems so. But... we don’t know what to do, you see! She\ncame back--she seems to have been turned out somewhere, perhaps\nbeaten.... So it seems at least,... She had run to your father’s former\nchief, she didn’t find him at home: he was dining at some other\ngeneral’s.... Only fancy, she rushed off there, to the other general’s,\nand, imagine, she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to\nsee her, had him fetched out from dinner, it seems. You can imagine what\nhappened. She was turned out, of course; but, according to her own\nstory, she abused him and threw something at him. One may well believe\nit.... How it is she wasn’t taken up, I can’t understand! Now she is\ntelling everyone, including Amalia Ivanovna; but it’s difficult to\nunderstand her, she is screaming and flinging herself about.... Oh yes,\nshe shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take the\nchildren and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the children\nwill sing and dance, and she too, and collect money, and will go every\nday under the general’s window... ‘to let everyone see well-born\nchildren, whose father was an official, begging in the street.’ She\nkeeps beating the children and they are all crying. She is teaching Lida\nto sing ‘My Village,’ the boy to dance, Polenka the same. She is tearing\nup all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; she means\nto carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of music.... She won’t\nlisten to anything.... Imagine the state of things! It’s beyond\nanything!”\n\nLebeziatnikov would have gone on, but Sonia, who had heard him almost\nbreathless, snatched up her cloak and hat, and ran out of the room,\nputting on her things as she went. Raskolnikov followed her and\nLebeziatnikov came after him.\n\n“She has certainly gone mad!” he said to Raskolnikov, as they went out\ninto the street. “I didn’t want to frighten Sofya Semyonovna, so I said\n‘it seemed like it,’ but there isn’t a doubt of it. They say that in\nconsumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; it’s a pity I\nknow nothing of medicine. I did try to persuade her, but she wouldn’t\nlisten.”\n\n“Did you talk to her about the tubercles?”\n\n“Not precisely of the tubercles. Besides, she wouldn’t have understood!\nBut what I say is, that if you convince a person logically that he\nhas nothing to cry about, he’ll stop crying. That’s clear. Is it your\nconviction that he won’t?”\n\n“Life would be too easy if it were so,” answered Raskolnikov.\n\n“Excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult for\nKaterina Ivanovna to understand, but do you know that in Paris they have\nbeen conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the\ninsane, simply by logical argument? One professor there, a scientific\nman of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such\ntreatment. His idea was that there’s nothing really wrong with the\nphysical organism of the insane, and that insanity is, so to say, a\nlogical mistake, an error of judgment, an incorrect view of things. He\ngradually showed the madman his error and, would you believe it, they\nsay he was successful? But as he made use of douches too, how far\nsuccess was due to that treatment remains uncertain.... So it seems at\nleast.”\n\nRaskolnikov had long ceased to listen. Reaching the house where he\nlived, he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate. Lebeziatnikov\nwoke up with a start, looked about him and hurried on.\n\nRaskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle\nof it. Why had he come back here? He looked at the yellow and tattered\npaper, at the dust, at his sofa.... From the yard came a loud continuous\nknocking; someone seemed to be hammering... He went to the window, rose\non tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of\nabsorbed attention. But the yard was empty and he could not see who was\nhammering. In the house on the left he saw some open windows; on the\nwindow-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums. Linen was hung out\nof the windows... He knew it all by heart. He turned away and sat down\non the sofa.\n\nNever, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!\n\nYes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate Sonia, now\nthat he had made her more miserable.\n\n“Why had he gone to her to beg for her tears? What need had he to poison\nher life? Oh, the meanness of it!”\n\n“I will remain alone,” he said resolutely, “and she shall not come to\nthe prison!”\n\nFive minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile. That was a\nstrange thought.\n\n“Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia,” he thought suddenly.\n\nHe could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surging\nthrough his mind. All at once the door opened and Dounia came in. At\nfirst she stood still and looked at him from the doorway, just as he\nhad done at Sonia; then she came in and sat down in the same place\nas yesterday, on the chair facing him. He looked silently and almost\nvacantly at her.\n\n“Don’t be angry, brother; I’ve only come for one minute,” said Dounia.\n\nHer face looked thoughtful but not stern. Her eyes were bright and soft.\nHe saw that she too had come to him with love.\n\n“Brother, now I know all, _all_. Dmitri Prokofitch has explained and\ntold me everything. They are worrying and persecuting you through a\nstupid and contemptible suspicion.... Dmitri Prokofitch told me that\nthere is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such\nhorror. I don’t think so, and I fully understand how indignant you must\nbe, and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you. That’s\nwhat I am afraid of. As for your cutting yourself off from us, I don’t\njudge you, I don’t venture to judge you, and forgive me for having\nblamed you for it. I feel that I too, if I had so great a trouble,\nshould keep away from everyone. I shall tell mother nothing _of this_,\nbut I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that\nyou will come very soon. Don’t worry about her; _I_ will set her mind at\nrest; but don’t you try her too much--come once at least; remember that\nshe is your mother. And now I have come simply to say” (Dounia began\nto get up) “that if you should need me or should need... all my life or\nanything... call me, and I’ll come. Good-bye!”\n\nShe turned abruptly and went towards the door.\n\n“Dounia!” Raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her. “That Razumihin,\nDmitri Prokofitch, is a very good fellow.”\n\nDounia flushed slightly.\n\n“Well?” she asked, waiting a moment.\n\n“He is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of real love....\nGood-bye, Dounia.”\n\nDounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm.\n\n“But what does it mean, brother? Are we really parting for ever that\nyou... give me such a parting message?”\n\n“Never mind.... Good-bye.”\n\nHe turned away, and walked to the window. She stood a moment, looked at\nhim uneasily, and went out troubled.\n\nNo, he was not cold to her. There was an instant (the very last one)\nwhen he had longed to take her in his arms and _say good-bye_ to her,\nand even _to tell_ her, but he had not dared even to touch her hand.\n\n“Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I embraced her, and\nwill feel that I stole her kiss.”\n\n“And would _she_ stand that test?” he went on a few minutes later to\nhimself. “No, she wouldn’t; girls like that can’t stand things! They\nnever do.”\n\nAnd he thought of Sonia.\n\nThere was a breath of fresh air from the window. The daylight was\nfading. He took up his cap and went out.\n\nHe could not, of course, and would not consider how ill he was. But all\nthis continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him. And\nif he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this\ncontinual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession\nof his faculties. But this artificial excitement could not last long.\n\nHe wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A special form of misery had\nbegun to oppress him of late. There was nothing poignant, nothing acute\nabout it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it;\nit brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a\nforetaste of an eternity “on a square yard of space.” Towards evening\nthis sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily.\n\n“With this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending on the sunset or\nsomething, one can’t help doing something stupid! You’ll go to Dounia,\nas well as to Sonia,” he muttered bitterly.\n\nHe heard his name called. He looked round. Lebeziatnikov rushed up to\nhim.\n\n“Only fancy, I’ve been to your room looking for you. Only fancy, she’s\ncarried out her plan, and taken away the children. Sofya Semyonovna and\nI have had a job to find them. She is rapping on a frying-pan and making\nthe children dance. The children are crying. They keep stopping at the\ncross-roads and in front of shops; there’s a crowd of fools running\nafter them. Come along!”\n\n“And Sonia?” Raskolnikov asked anxiously, hurrying after Lebeziatnikov.\n\n“Simply frantic. That is, it’s not Sofya Semyonovna’s frantic, but\nKaterina Ivanovna, though Sofya Semyonova’s frantic too. But Katerina\nIvanovna is absolutely frantic. I tell you she is quite mad. They’ll be\ntaken to the police. You can fancy what an effect that will have....\nThey are on the canal bank, near the bridge now, not far from Sofya\nSemyonovna’s, quite close.”\n\nOn the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one\nwhere Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of people, consisting principally\nof gutter children. The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could\nbe heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle\nlikely to attract a street crowd. Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress\nwith the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous way\non one side, was really frantic. She was exhausted and breathless. Her\nwasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever, and indeed out\nof doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.\nBut her excitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew\nmore intense. She rushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxed\nthem, told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing, began\nexplaining to them why it was necessary, and driven to desperation by\ntheir not understanding, beat them.... Then she would make a rush at the\ncrowd; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, she\nimmediately appealed to him to see what these children “from a genteel,\none may say aristocratic, house” had been brought to. If she heard\nlaughter or jeering in the crowd, she would rush at once at the scoffers\nand begin squabbling with them. Some people laughed, others shook their\nheads, but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the\nfrightened children. The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken\nwas not there, at least Raskolnikov did not see it. But instead of\nrapping on the pan, Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands,\nwhen she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She too joined in\nthe singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough,\nwhich made her curse in despair and even shed tears. What made her most\nfurious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had\nbeen made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed. The\nboy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk.\nThere had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a red knitted cap,\nor rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated with\na broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been Katerina\nIvanovna’s grandmother’s and had been preserved as a family possession.\nPolenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her\nmother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears. She dimly realised her\nmother’s condition, and looked uneasily about her. She was terribly\nfrightened of the street and the crowd. Sonia followed Katerina\nIvanovna, weeping and beseeching her to return home, but Katerina\nIvanovna was not to be persuaded.\n\n“Leave off, Sonia, leave off,” she shouted, speaking fast, panting and\ncoughing. “You don’t know what you ask; you are like a child! I’ve\ntold you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German. Let\neveryone, let all Petersburg see the children begging in the streets,\nthough their father was an honourable man who served all his life in\ntruth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service.” (Katerina\nIvanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly\nbelieved it.) “Let that wretch of a general see it! And you are silly,\nSonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. We have worried you enough, I\nwon’t go on so! Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, is that you?” she cried, seeing\nRaskolnikov and rushing up to him. “Explain to this silly girl, please,\nthat nothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn their\nliving, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are\nan honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary. And that general\nwill lose his post, you’ll see! We shall perform under his windows every\nday, and if the Tsar drives by, I’ll fall on my knees, put the children\nbefore me, show them to him, and say ‘Defend us father.’ He is the\nfather of the fatherless, he is merciful, he’ll protect us, you’ll\nsee, and that wretch of a general.... Lida, _tenez vous droite_! Kolya,\nyou’ll dance again. Why are you whimpering? Whimpering again! What\nare you afraid of, stupid? Goodness, what am I to do with them, Rodion\nRomanovitch? If you only knew how stupid they are! What’s one to do with\nsuch children?”\n\nAnd she, almost crying herself--which did not stop her uninterrupted,\nrapid flow of talk--pointed to the crying children. Raskolnikov tried\nto persuade her to go home, and even said, hoping to work on her vanity,\nthat it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like\nan organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the principal of a\nboarding-school.\n\n“A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha! A castle in the air,” cried Katerina\nIvanovna, her laugh ending in a cough. “No, Rodion Romanovitch, that\ndream is over! All have forsaken us!... And that general.... You know,\nRodion Romanovitch, I threw an inkpot at him--it happened to be standing\nin the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name. I wrote my\nname, threw it at him and ran away. Oh, the scoundrels, the scoundrels!\nBut enough of them, now I’ll provide for the children myself, I won’t\nbow down to anybody! She has had to bear enough for us!” she pointed\nto Sonia. “Polenka, how much have you got? Show me! What, only two\nfarthings! Oh, the mean wretches! They give us nothing, only run after\nus, putting their tongues out. There, what is that blockhead laughing\nat?” (She pointed to a man in the crowd.) “It’s all because Kolya here\nis so stupid; I have such a bother with him. What do you want, Polenka?\nTell me in French, _parlez-moi français_. Why, I’ve taught you, you know\nsome phrases. Else how are you to show that you are of good family, well\nbrought-up children, and not at all like other organ-grinders? We aren’t\ngoing to have a Punch and Judy show in the street, but to sing a genteel\nsong.... Ah, yes,... What are we to sing? You keep putting me out,\nbut we... you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, to find\nsomething to sing and get money, something Kolya can dance to.... For,\nas you can fancy, our performance is all impromptu.... We must talk it\nover and rehearse it all thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky,\nwhere there are far more people of good society, and we shall be noticed\nat once. Lida knows ‘My Village’ only, nothing but ‘My Village,’ and\neveryone sings that. We must sing something far more genteel.... Well,\nhave you thought of anything, Polenka? If only you’d help your mother!\nMy memory’s quite gone, or I should have thought of something. We really\ncan’t sing ‘An Hussar.’ Ah, let us sing in French, ‘Cinq sous,’ I have\ntaught it you, I have taught it you. And as it is in French, people will\nsee at once that you are children of good family, and that will be much\nmore touching.... You might sing ‘Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre,’\nfor that’s quite a child’s song and is sung as a lullaby in all the\naristocratic houses.\n\n“_Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra_...”\n she began singing. “But no, better sing ‘Cinq sous.’ Now, Kolya, your\nhands on your hips, make haste, and you, Lida, keep turning the other\nway, and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands!\n\n“_Cinq sous, cinq sous Pour monter notre menage_.”\n\n(Cough-cough-cough!) “Set your dress straight, Polenka, it’s slipped\ndown on your shoulders,” she observed, panting from coughing. “Now it’s\nparticularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly, that all may\nsee that you are well-born children. I said at the time that the bodice\nshould be cut longer, and made of two widths. It was your fault, Sonia,\nwith your advice to make it shorter, and now you see the child is quite\ndeformed by it.... Why, you’re all crying again! What’s the matter,\nstupids? Come, Kolya, begin. Make haste, make haste! Oh, what an\nunbearable child!\n\n“Cinq sous, cinq sous.\n\n“A policeman again! What do you want?”\n\nA policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd. But at that\nmoment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat--a solid-looking\nofficial of about fifty with a decoration on his neck (which delighted\nKaterina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman)--approached and\nwithout a word handed her a green three-rouble note. His face wore\na look of genuine sympathy. Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him a\npolite, even ceremonious, bow.\n\n“I thank you, honoured sir,” she began loftily. “The causes that have\ninduced us (take the money, Polenka: you see there are generous and\nhonourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress).\nYou see, honoured sir, these orphans of good family--I might even say of\naristocratic connections--and that wretch of a general sat eating\ngrouse... and stamped at my disturbing him. ‘Your excellency,’ I said,\n‘protect the orphans, for you knew my late husband, Semyon Zaharovitch,\nand on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his\nonly daughter.’... That policeman again! Protect me,” she cried to the\nofficial. “Why is that policeman edging up to me? We have only just run\naway from one of them. What do you want, fool?”\n\n“It’s forbidden in the streets. You mustn’t make a disturbance.”\n\n“It’s you’re making a disturbance. It’s just the same as if I were\ngrinding an organ. What business is it of yours?”\n\n“You have to get a licence for an organ, and you haven’t got one, and in\nthat way you collect a crowd. Where do you lodge?”\n\n“What, a license?” wailed Katerina Ivanovna. “I buried my husband\nto-day. What need of a license?”\n\n“Calm yourself, madam, calm yourself,” began the official. “Come along;\nI will escort you.... This is no place for you in the crowd. You are\nill.”\n\n“Honoured sir, honoured sir, you don’t know,” screamed Katerina\nIvanovna. “We are going to the Nevsky.... Sonia, Sonia! Where is she?\nShe is crying too! What’s the matter with you all? Kolya, Lida, where\nare you going?” she cried suddenly in alarm. “Oh, silly children! Kolya,\nLida, where are they off to?...”\n\nKolya and Lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, and their\nmother’s mad pranks, suddenly seized each other by the hand, and ran off\nat the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere.\nWeeping and wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She was\na piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and panting for\nbreath. Sonia and Polenka rushed after them.\n\n“Bring them back, bring them back, Sonia! Oh stupid, ungrateful\nchildren!... Polenka! catch them.... It’s for your sakes I...”\n\nShe stumbled as she ran and fell down.\n\n“She’s cut herself, she’s bleeding! Oh, dear!” cried Sonia, bending over\nher.\n\nAll ran up and crowded around. Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov were the\nfirst at her side, the official too hastened up, and behind him the\npoliceman who muttered, “Bother!” with a gesture of impatience, feeling\nthat the job was going to be a troublesome one.\n\n“Pass on! Pass on!” he said to the crowd that pressed forward.\n\n“She’s dying,” someone shouted.\n\n“She’s gone out of her mind,” said another.\n\n“Lord have mercy upon us,” said a woman, crossing herself. “Have they\ncaught the little girl and the boy? They’re being brought back, the\nelder one’s got them.... Ah, the naughty imps!”\n\nWhen they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she had\nnot cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the blood\nthat stained the pavement red was from her chest.\n\n“I’ve seen that before,” muttered the official to Raskolnikov and\nLebeziatnikov; “that’s consumption; the blood flows and chokes the\npatient. I saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago...\nnearly a pint of blood, all in a minute.... What’s to be done though?\nShe is dying.”\n\n“This way, this way, to my room!” Sonia implored. “I live here!... See,\nthat house, the second from here.... Come to me, make haste,” she turned\nfrom one to the other. “Send for the doctor! Oh, dear!”\n\nThanks to the official’s efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman\neven helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She was carried to Sonia’s\nroom, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed. The blood was still\nflowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself. Raskolnikov,\nLebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were\nfollowed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed\nto the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who\nwere trembling and weeping. Several persons came in too from the\nKapernaumovs’ room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange\nappearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his\nwife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several\nopen-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these,\nSvidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov looked at him\nwith surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not having\nnoticed him in the crowd. A doctor and priest wore spoken of. The\nofficial whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now\nfor the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ran\nhimself.\n\nMeanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. The bleeding ceased\nfor a time. She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at\nSonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with\na handkerchief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on the\nbed, supporting her on both sides.\n\n“Where are the children?” she said in a faint voice. “You’ve brought\nthem, Polenka? Oh the sillies! Why did you run away.... Och!”\n\nOnce more her parched lips were covered with blood. She moved her eyes,\nlooking about her.\n\n“So that’s how you live, Sonia! Never once have I been in your room.”\n\nShe looked at her with a face of suffering.\n\n“We have been your ruin, Sonia. Polenka, Lida, Kolya, come here! Well,\nhere they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand them over to you, I’ve had\nenough! The ball is over.” (Cough!) “Lay me down, let me die in peace.”\n\nThey laid her back on the pillow.\n\n“What, the priest? I don’t want him. You haven’t got a rouble to spare.\nI have no sins. God must forgive me without that. He knows how I have\nsuffered.... And if He won’t forgive me, I don’t care!”\n\nShe sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times she shuddered,\nturned her eyes from side to side, recognised everyone for a minute,\nbut at once sank into delirium again. Her breathing was hoarse and\ndifficult, there was a sort of rattle in her throat.\n\n“I said to him, your excellency,” she ejaculated, gasping after each\nword. “That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah! Lida, Kolya, hands on your hips,\nmake haste! _Glissez, glissez! pas de basque!_ Tap with your heels, be a\ngraceful child!\n\n“_Du hast Diamanten und Perlen_\n\n“What next? That’s the thing to sing.\n\n“_Du hast die schönsten Augen Mädchen, was willst du mehr?_\n\n“What an idea! _Was willst du mehr?_ What things the fool invents! Ah,\nyes!\n\n“In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan.\n\n“Ah, how I loved it! I loved that song to distraction, Polenka! Your\nfather, you know, used to sing it when we were engaged.... Oh those\ndays! Oh that’s the thing for us to sing! How does it go? I’ve\nforgotten. Remind me! How was it?”\n\nShe was violently excited and tried to sit up. At last, in a horribly\nhoarse, broken voice, she began, shrieking and gasping at every word,\nwith a look of growing terror.\n\n“In the heat of midday!... in the vale!... of Dagestan!... With lead in\nmy breast!...”\n\n“Your excellency!” she wailed suddenly with a heart-rending scream and\na flood of tears, “protect the orphans! You have been their father’s\nguest... one may say aristocratic....” She started, regaining\nconsciousness, and gazed at all with a sort of terror, but at once\nrecognised Sonia.\n\n“Sonia, Sonia!” she articulated softly and caressingly, as though\nsurprised to find her there. “Sonia darling, are you here, too?”\n\nThey lifted her up again.\n\n“Enough! It’s over! Farewell, poor thing! I am done for! I am broken!”\n she cried with vindictive despair, and her head fell heavily back on the\npillow.\n\nShe sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long.\nHer pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open, her leg\nmoved convulsively, she gave a deep, deep sigh and died.\n\nSonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and remained motionless\nwith her head pressed to the dead woman’s wasted bosom. Polenka threw\nherself at her mother’s feet, kissing them and weeping violently. Though\nKolya and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feeling\nthat it was something terrible; they put their hands on each other’s\nlittle shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once opened\ntheir mouths and began screaming. They were both still in their fancy\ndress; one in a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.\n\nAnd how did “the certificate of merit” come to be on the bed beside\nKaterina Ivanovna? It lay there by the pillow; Raskolnikov saw it.\n\nHe walked away to the window. Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him.\n\n“She is dead,” he said.\n\n“Rodion Romanovitch, I must have two words with you,” said Svidrigaïlov,\ncoming up to them.\n\nLebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew.\nSvidrigaïlov drew Raskolnikov further away.\n\n“I will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and that. You know\nit’s a question of money and, as I told you, I have plenty to spare. I\nwill put those two little ones and Polenka into some good orphan asylum,\nand I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming\nof age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them. And I\nwill pull her out of the mud too, for she is a good girl, isn’t she? So\ntell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her ten thousand.”\n\n“What is your motive for such benevolence?” asked Raskolnikov.\n\n“Ah! you sceptical person!” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “I told you I had no\nneed of that money. Won’t you admit that it’s simply done from humanity?\nShe wasn’t ‘a louse,’ you know” (he pointed to the corner where the\ndead woman lay), “was she, like some old pawnbroker woman? Come, you’ll\nagree, is Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is she to\ndie? And if I didn’t help them, Polenka would go the same way.”\n\nHe said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, keeping his\neyes fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white and cold, hearing his own\nphrases, spoken to Sonia. He quickly stepped back and looked wildly at\nSvidrigaïlov.\n\n“How do you know?” he whispered, hardly able to breathe.\n\n“Why, I lodge here at Madame Resslich’s, the other side of the wall.\nHere is Kapernaumov, and there lives Madame Resslich, an old and devoted\nfriend of mine. I am a neighbour.”\n\n“You?”\n\n“Yes,” continued Svidrigaïlov, shaking with laughter. “I assure you\non my honour, dear Rodion Romanovitch, that you have interested me\nenormously. I told you we should become friends, I foretold it. Well,\nhere we have. And you will see what an accommodating person I am. You’ll\nsee that you can get on with me!”\n\n\n\n\nPART VI\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nA strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had\nfallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there\nwas no escape. Recalling that period long after, he believed that his\nmind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with\nintervals, till the final catastrophe. He was convinced that he had been\nmistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date\nof certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to piece his\nrecollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from what\nother people told him. He had mixed up incidents and had explained\nevents as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination. At\ntimes he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes\nto panic. But he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days,\nof complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previous\nterror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes\nseen in the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape\nfrom a full and clear understanding of his position. Certain essential\nfacts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome\nto him. How glad he would have been to be free from some cares, the\nneglect of which would have threatened him with complete, inevitable\nruin.\n\nHe was particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov, he might be said to be\npermanently thinking of Svidrigaïlov. From the time of Svidrigaïlov’s\ntoo menacing and unmistakable words in Sonia’s room at the moment of\nKaterina Ivanovna’s death, the normal working of his mind seemed to\nbreak down. But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness,\nRaskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it. At times, finding\nhimself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched\neating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had\ncome there, he suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov. He recognised\nsuddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an\nunderstanding with that man and to make what terms he could. Walking\noutside the city gates one day, he positively fancied that they had\nfixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for Svidrigaïlov. Another\ntime he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes\nand could not at first understand how he had come there.\n\nBut during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna’s death, he\nhad two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at Sonia’s lodging, where he\nhad gone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged a few words and made no\nreference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not\nto speak of it for a time.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna’s body was still lying in the coffin, Svidrigaïlov was\nbusy making arrangements for the funeral. Sonia too was very busy. At\ntheir last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made\nan arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s\nchildren; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting\nhold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at\nonce placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled\non them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place\norphans with some property than destitute ones. He said something\ntoo about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see\nRaskolnikov, mentioning that “he would like to consult with him, that\nthere were things they must talk over....”\n\nThis conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. Svidrigaïlov\nlooked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause,\ndropping his voice, asked: “But how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you\ndon’t seem yourself? You look and you listen, but you don’t seem to\nunderstand. Cheer up! We’ll talk things over; I am only sorry, I’ve\nso much to do of my own business and other people’s. Ah, Rodion\nRomanovitch,” he added suddenly, “what all men need is fresh air, fresh\nair... more than anything!”\n\nHe moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, who\nwere coming up the stairs. They had come for the requiem service. By\nSvidrigaïlov’s orders it was sung twice a day punctually. Svidrigaïlov\nwent his way. Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed\nthe priest into Sonia’s room. He stood at the door. They began quietly,\nslowly and mournfully singing the service. From his childhood the\nthought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive\nand mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem\nservice. And there was something else here as well, too awful and\ndisturbing. He looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the\ncoffin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and, as it\nwere, timidly weeping.\n\n“These last two days she hasn’t said a word to me, she hasn’t glanced at\nme,” Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The sunlight was bright in the room;\nthe incense rose in clouds; the priest read, “Give rest, oh Lord....”\n Raskolnikov stayed all through the service. As he blessed them and\ntook his leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service,\nRaskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and let her\nhead sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly gesture bewildered\nRaskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of\nrepugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand. It was the\nfurthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it.\n\nSonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out. He felt\nvery miserable. If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he\nwould have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life\nthere. But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had\nnever been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out of the town on to\nthe high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier\nthe place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near\nhim. It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he\nmade haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter\nrestaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares. There he felt\neasier and even more solitary. One day at dusk he sat for an hour\nlistening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively\nenjoyed it. But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again,\nas though his conscience smote him. “Here I sit listening to singing,\nis that what I ought to be doing?” he thought. Yet he felt at once\nthat that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something\nrequiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearly\nunderstand or put into words. It was a hopeless tangle. “No, better the\nstruggle again! Better Porfiry again... or Svidrigaïlov.... Better some\nchallenge again... some attack. Yes, yes!” he thought. He went out of\nthe tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of Dounia and\nhis mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic. That night he woke\nup before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling\nall over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when he\narrived. After some hours’ sleep the fever left him, but he woke up\nlate, two o’clock in the afternoon.\n\nHe remembered that Katerina Ivanovna’s funeral had been fixed for that\nday, and was glad that he was not present at it. Nastasya brought him\nsome food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness. His\nhead was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three\ndays. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.\n\nThe door opened and Razumihin came in.\n\n“Ah, he’s eating, then he’s not ill,” said Razumihin. He took a chair\nand sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.\n\nHe was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He spoke with evident\nannoyance, but without hurry or raising his voice. He looked as though\nhe had some special fixed determination.\n\n“Listen,” he began resolutely. “As far as I am concerned, you may all go\nto hell, but from what I see, it’s clear to me that I can’t make head or\ntail of it; please don’t think I’ve come to ask you questions. I don’t\nwant to know, hang it! If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say\nI shouldn’t stay to listen, I should go away cursing. I have only come\nto find out once for all whether it’s a fact that you are mad? There is\na conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. I admit\nI’ve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid,\nrepulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior\nto your mother and sister. Only a monster or a madman could treat them\nas you have; so you must be mad.”\n\n“When did you see them last?”\n\n“Just now. Haven’t you seen them since then? What have you been doing\nwith yourself? Tell me, please. I’ve been to you three times already.\nYour mother has been seriously ill since yesterday. She had made up\nher mind to come to you; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she\nwouldn’t hear a word. ‘If he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can\nlook after him like his mother?’ she said. We all came here together, we\ncouldn’t let her come alone all the way. We kept begging her to be calm.\nWe came in, you weren’t here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes,\nwhile we stood waiting in silence. She got up and said: ‘If he’s\ngone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, it’s\nhumiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for\nkindness.’ She returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever.\n‘I see,’ she said, ‘that he has time for _his girl_.’ She means by _your\ngirl_ Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, I don’t know. I\nwent at once to Sofya Semyonovna’s, for I wanted to know what was going\non. I looked round, I saw the coffin, the children crying, and\nSofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses. No sign of you. I\napologised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. So that’s all\nnonsense and you haven’t got a girl; the most likely thing is that you\nare mad. But here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though you’d not had\na bite for three days. Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but\nthough you have not said a word to me yet... you are not mad! That I’d\nswear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may go to hell, all of you,\nfor there’s some mystery, some secret about it, and I don’t intend to\nworry my brains over your secrets. So I’ve simply come to swear at you,”\n he finished, getting up, “to relieve my mind. And I know what to do\nnow.”\n\n“What do you mean to do now?”\n\n“What business is it of yours what I mean to do?”\n\n“You are going in for a drinking bout.”\n\n“How... how did you know?”\n\n“Why, it’s pretty plain.”\n\nRazumihin paused for a minute.\n\n“You always have been a very rational person and you’ve never been mad,\nnever,” he observed suddenly with warmth. “You’re right: I shall drink.\nGood-bye!”\n\nAnd he moved to go out.\n\n“I was talking with my sister--the day before yesterday, I think it\nwas--about you, Razumihin.”\n\n“About me! But... where can you have seen her the day before yesterday?”\n Razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale.\n\nOne could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently.\n\n“She came here by herself, sat there and talked to me.”\n\n“She did!”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What did you say to her... I mean, about me?”\n\n“I told her you were a very good, honest, and industrious man. I didn’t\ntell her you love her, because she knows that herself.”\n\n“She knows that herself?”\n\n“Well, it’s pretty plain. Wherever I might go, whatever happened to me,\nyou would remain to look after them. I, so to speak, give them into your\nkeeping, Razumihin. I say this because I know quite well how you love\nher, and am convinced of the purity of your heart. I know that she too\nmay love you and perhaps does love you already. Now decide for yourself,\nas you know best, whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not.”\n\n“Rodya! You see... well.... Ach, damn it! But where do you mean to go?\nOf course, if it’s all a secret, never mind.... But I... I shall find\nout the secret... and I am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense\nand that you’ve made it all up. Anyway you are a capital fellow, a\ncapital fellow!...”\n\n“That was just what I wanted to add, only you interrupted, that that was\na very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets. Leave it to\ntime, don’t worry about it. You’ll know it all in time when it must be.\nYesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air, fresh\nair, fresh air. I mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant\nby that.”\n\nRazumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, making a silent\nconclusion.\n\n“He’s a political conspirator! He must be. And he’s on the eve of some\ndesperate step, that’s certain. It can only be that! And... and Dounia\nknows,” he thought suddenly.\n\n“So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you,” he said, weighing each\nsyllable, “and you’re going to see a man who says we need more air, and\nso of course that letter... that too must have something to do with it,”\n he concluded to himself.\n\n“What letter?”\n\n“She got a letter to-day. It upset her very much--very much indeed. Too\nmuch so. I began speaking of you, she begged me not to. Then... then\nshe said that perhaps we should very soon have to part... then she began\nwarmly thanking me for something; then she went to her room and locked\nherself in.”\n\n“She got a letter?” Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully.\n\n“Yes, and you didn’t know? hm...”\n\nThey were both silent.\n\n“Good-bye, Rodion. There was a time, brother, when I.... Never mind,\ngood-bye. You see, there was a time.... Well, good-bye! I must be off\ntoo. I am not going to drink. There’s no need now.... That’s all stuff!”\n\nHe hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door behind him, he\nsuddenly opened it again, and said, looking away:\n\n“Oh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know Porfiry’s, that\nold woman? Do you know the murderer has been found, he has confessed\nand given the proofs. It’s one of those very workmen, the painter, only\nfancy! Do you remember I defended them here? Would you believe it, all\nthat scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairs\nwhile the porter and the two witnesses were going up, he got up on\npurpose to disarm suspicion. The cunning, the presence of mind of the\nyoung dog! One can hardly credit it; but it’s his own explanation, he\nhas confessed it all. And what a fool I was about it! Well, he’s simply\na genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of\nthe lawyers--so there’s nothing much to wonder at, I suppose! Of course\npeople like that are always possible. And the fact that he couldn’t keep\nup the character, but confessed, makes him easier to believe in. But\nwhat a fool I was! I was frantic on their side!”\n\n“Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why does it interest\nyou so?” Raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation.\n\n“What next? You ask me why it interests me!... Well, I heard it from\nPorfiry, among others... It was from him I heard almost all about it.”\n\n“From Porfiry?”\n\n“From Porfiry.”\n\n“What... what did he say?” Raskolnikov asked in dismay.\n\n“He gave me a capital explanation of it. Psychologically, after his\nfashion.”\n\n“He explained it? Explained it himself?”\n\n“Yes, yes; good-bye. I’ll tell you all about it another time, but now\nI’m busy. There was a time when I fancied... But no matter, another\ntime!... What need is there for me to drink now? You have made me drunk\nwithout wine. I am drunk, Rodya! Good-bye, I’m going. I’ll come again\nvery soon.”\n\nHe went out.\n\n“He’s a political conspirator, there’s not a doubt about it,” Razumihin\ndecided, as he slowly descended the stairs. “And he’s drawn his sister\nin; that’s quite, quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovna’s character.\nThere are interviews between them!... She hinted at it too... So many of\nher words.... and hints... bear that meaning! And how else can all this\ntangle be explained? Hm! And I was almost thinking... Good heavens,\nwhat I thought! Yes, I took leave of my senses and I wronged him! It was\nhis doing, under the lamp in the corridor that day. Pfoo! What a crude,\nnasty, vile idea on my part! Nikolay is a brick, for confessing.... And\nhow clear it all is now! His illness then, all his strange actions...\nbefore this, in the university, how morose he used to be, how gloomy....\nBut what’s the meaning now of that letter? There’s something in that,\ntoo, perhaps. Whom was it from? I suspect...! No, I must find out!”\n\nHe thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed,\nand he suddenly broke into a run.\n\nAs soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, turned to the window,\nwalked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting the\nsmallness of his room, and sat down again on the sofa. He felt, so to\nspeak, renewed; again the struggle, so a means of escape had come.\n\n“Yes, a means of escape had come! It had been too stifling, too\ncramping, the burden had been too agonising. A lethargy had come upon\nhim at times. From the moment of the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry’s he\nhad been suffocating, penned in without hope of escape. After Nikolay’s\nconfession, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his\nbehaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he\ncould have imagined beforehand; he had grown feebler, instantly and\nfundamentally! And he had agreed at the time with Sonia, he had agreed\nin his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his\nmind!\n\n“And Svidrigaïlov was a riddle... He worried him, that was true, but\nsomehow not on the same point. He might still have a struggle to come\nwith Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov, too, might be a means of escape; but\nPorfiry was a different matter.\n\n“And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, had explained it\n_psychologically_. He had begun bringing in his damned psychology again!\nPorfiry? But to think that Porfiry should for one moment believe that\nNikolay was guilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolay’s\nappearance, after that tête-à-tête interview, which could have only\n_one_ explanation? (During those days Raskolnikov had often recalled\npassages in that scene with Porfiry; he could not bear to let his mind\nrest on it.) Such words, such gestures had passed between them, they\nhad exchanged such glances, things had been said in such a tone and had\nreached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen through at the\nfirst word, at the first gesture, could not have shaken his conviction.\n\n“And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect! The scene in the\ncorridor under the lamp had produced its effect then. He had rushed to\nPorfiry.... But what had induced the latter to receive him like that?\nWhat had been his object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay? He must\nhave some plan; there was some design, but what was it? It was true that\na long time had passed since that morning--too long a time--and no sight\nnor sound of Porfiry. Well, that was a bad sign....”\n\nRaskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still pondering. It\nwas the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind,\nat least. “I must settle Svidrigaïlov,” he thought, “and as soon as\npossible; he, too, seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own\naccord.” And at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his\nweary heart that he might have killed either of those two--Porfiry or\nSvidrigaïlov. At least he felt that he would be capable of doing it\nlater, if not now.\n\n“We shall see, we shall see,” he repeated to himself.\n\nBut no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiry\nhimself in the passage. He was coming in to see him. Raskolnikov was\ndumbfounded for a minute, but only for one minute. Strange to say, he\nwas not very much astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of\nhim. He was simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his guard.\n“Perhaps this will mean the end? But how could Porfiry have approached\nso quietly, like a cat, so that he had heard nothing? Could he have been\nlistening at the door?”\n\n“You didn’t expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch,” Porfiry explained,\nlaughing. “I’ve been meaning to look in a long time; I was passing by\nand thought why not go in for five minutes. Are you going out? I won’t\nkeep you long. Just let me have one cigarette.”\n\n“Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down.” Raskolnikov gave his visitor\na seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have\nmarvelled at himself, if he could have seen it.\n\nThe last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained! So a man\nwill sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand,\nyet when the knife is at his throat at last, he feels no fear.\n\nRaskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and looked at him\nwithout flinching. Porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a\ncigarette.\n\n“Speak, speak,” seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikov’s\nheart. “Come, why don’t you speak?”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n“Ah these cigarettes!” Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, having\nlighted one. “They are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet I\ncan’t give them up! I cough, I begin to have tickling in my throat and\na difficulty in breathing. You know I am a coward, I went lately to\nDr. B----n; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient. He\npositively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: ‘Tobacco’s bad for\nyou,’ he said, ‘your lungs are affected.’ But how am I to give it up?\nWhat is there to take its place? I don’t drink, that’s the mischief,\nhe-he-he, that I don’t. Everything is relative, Rodion Romanovitch,\neverything is relative!”\n\n“Why, he’s playing his professional tricks again,” Raskolnikov thought\nwith disgust. All the circumstances of their last interview suddenly\ncame back to him, and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon\nhim then.\n\n“I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening; you didn’t\nknow?” Porfiry Petrovitch went on, looking round the room. “I came into\nthis very room. I was passing by, just as I did to-day, and I thought\nI’d return your call. I walked in as your door was wide open, I looked\nround, waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant.\nDon’t you lock your door?”\n\nRaskolnikov’s face grew more and more gloomy. Porfiry seemed to guess\nhis state of mind.\n\n“I’ve come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow!\nI owe you an explanation and must give it to you,” he continued with a\nslight smile, just patting Raskolnikov’s knee.\n\nBut almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his\nface; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it. He had\nnever seen and never suspected such an expression in his face.\n\n“A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch.\nOur first interview, too, was a strange one; but then... and one thing\nafter another! This is the point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you;\nI feel it. Do you remember how we parted? Your nerves were unhinged and\nyour knees were shaking and so were mine. And, you know, our behaviour\nwas unseemly, even ungentlemanly. And yet we are gentlemen, above all,\nin any case, gentlemen; that must be understood. Do you remember what we\ncame to?... and it was quite indecorous.”\n\n“What is he up to, what does he take me for?” Raskolnikov asked himself\nin amazement, raising his head and looking with open eyes on Porfiry.\n\n“I’ve decided openness is better between us,” Porfiry Petrovitch went\non, turning his head away and dropping his eyes, as though unwilling to\ndisconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles.\n“Yes, such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long. Nikolay\nput a stop to it, or I don’t know what we might not have come to. That\ndamned workman was sitting at the time in the next room--can you realise\nthat? You know that, of course; and I am aware that he came to you\nafterwards. But what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for\nanyone, I had made no kind of arrangements. You ask why I hadn’t? What\nshall I say to you? it had all come upon me so suddenly. I had scarcely\nsent for the porters (you noticed them as you went out, I dare say).\nAn idea flashed upon me; I was firmly convinced at the time, you see,\nRodion Romanovitch. Come, I thought--even if I let one thing slip for\na time, I shall get hold of something else--I shan’t lose what I want,\nanyway. You are nervously irritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament;\nit’s out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character,\nwhich I flatter myself I have to some extent divined. Of course I did\nreflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and\nblurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes, if you make a\nman lose all patience, though even then it’s rare. I was capable of\nrealising that. If I only had a fact, I thought, the least little fact\nto go upon, something I could lay hold of, something tangible, not\nmerely psychological. For if a man is guilty, you must be able to get\nsomething substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising\nresults indeed. I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Romanovitch,\non your temperament above all things! I had great hopes of you at that\ntime.”\n\n“But what are you driving at now?” Raskolnikov muttered at last, asking\nthe question without thinking.\n\n“What is he talking about?” he wondered distractedly, “does he really\ntake me to be innocent?”\n\n“What am I driving at? I’ve come to explain myself, I consider it my\nduty, so to speak. I want to make clear to you how the whole business,\nthe whole misunderstanding arose. I’ve caused you a great deal of\nsuffering, Rodion Romanovitch. I am not a monster. I understand what\nit must mean for a man who has been unfortunate, but who is proud,\nimperious and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment!\nI regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without\nelements of magnanimity, though I don’t agree with all your convictions.\nI wanted to tell you this first, frankly and quite sincerely, for above\nall I don’t want to deceive you. When I made your acquaintance, I felt\nattracted by you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have a\nright to. I know you disliked me from the first and indeed you’ve no\nreason to like me. You may think what you like, but I desire now to do\nall I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heart\nand conscience. I speak sincerely.”\n\nPorfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause. Raskolnikov felt a rush of\nrenewed alarm. The thought that Porfiry believed him to be innocent\nbegan to make him uneasy.\n\n“It’s scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail,” Porfiry\nPetrovitch went on. “Indeed, I could scarcely attempt it. To begin with\nthere were rumours. Through whom, how, and when those rumours came to\nme... and how they affected you, I need not go into. My suspicions\nwere aroused by a complete accident, which might just as easily not have\nhappened. What was it? Hm! I believe there is no need to go into that\neither. Those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind. I\nadmit it openly--for one may as well make a clean breast of it--I was\nthe first to pitch on you. The old woman’s notes on the pledges and\nthe rest of it--that all came to nothing. Yours was one of a hundred.\nI happened, too, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man who\ndescribed it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene with great\nvividness. It was just one thing after another, Rodion Romanovitch, my\ndear fellow! How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas? From a\nhundred rabbits you can’t make a horse, a hundred suspicions don’t make\na proof, as the English proverb says, but that’s only from the rational\npoint of view--you can’t help being partial, for after all a lawyer\nis only human. I thought, too, of your article in that journal, do you\nremember, on your first visit we talked of it? I jeered at you at the\ntime, but that was only to lead you on. I repeat, Rodion Romanovitch,\nyou are ill and impatient. That you were bold, headstrong, in earnest\nand... had felt a great deal I recognised long before. I, too, have felt\nthe same, so that your article seemed familiar to me. It was conceived\non sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and suppressed\nenthusiasm. And that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is\ndangerous! I jeered at you then, but let me tell you that, as a literary\namateur, I am awfully fond of such first essays, full of the heat of\nyouth. There is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist. Your\narticle is absurd and fantastic, but there’s a transparent sincerity,\na youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it. It’s a\ngloomy article, but that’s what’s fine in it. I read your article and\nput it aside, thinking as I did so ‘that man won’t go the common way.’\nWell, I ask you, after that as a preliminary, how could I help being\ncarried away by what followed? Oh, dear, I am not saying anything, I\nam not making any statement now. I simply noted it at the time. What is\nthere in it? I reflected. There’s nothing in it, that is really nothing\nand perhaps absolutely nothing. And it’s not at all the thing for\nthe prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions: here I have\nNikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him--you may think what\nyou like of it, but it’s evidence. He brings in his psychology, too; one\nhas to consider him, too, for it’s a matter of life and death. Why am\nI explaining this to you? That you may understand, and not blame my\nmalicious behaviour on that occasion. It was not malicious, I assure\nyou, he-he! Do you suppose I didn’t come to search your room at the\ntime? I did, I did, he-he! I was here when you were lying ill in bed,\nnot officially, not in my own person, but I was here. Your room was\nsearched to the last thread at the first suspicion; but _umsonst_! I\nthought to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself and\nquickly, too; if he’s guilty, he’s sure to come. Another man wouldn’t,\nbut he will. And you remember how Mr. Razumihin began discussing the\nsubject with you? We arranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread\nrumours, that he might discuss the case with you, and Razumihin is not a\nman to restrain his indignation. Mr. Zametov was tremendously struck by\nyour anger and your open daring. Think of blurting out in a restaurant\n‘I killed her.’ It was too daring, too reckless. I thought so myself, if\nhe is guilty he will be a formidable opponent. That was what I thought\nat the time. I was expecting you. But you simply bowled Zametov over\nand... well, you see, it all lies in this--that this damnable psychology\ncan be taken two ways! Well, I kept expecting you, and so it was, you\ncame! My heart was fairly throbbing. Ach!\n\n“Now, why need you have come? Your laughter, too, as you came in, do you\nremember? I saw it all plain as daylight, but if I hadn’t expected you\nso specially, I should not have noticed anything in your laughter. You\nsee what influence a mood has! Mr. Razumihin then--ah, that stone, that\nstone under which the things were hidden! I seem to see it somewhere\nin a kitchen garden. It was in a kitchen garden, you told Zametov and\nafterwards you repeated that in my office? And when we began picking\nyour article to pieces, how you explained it! One could take every word\nof yours in two senses, as though there were another meaning hidden.\n\n“So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the furthest limit, and\nknocking my head against a post, I pulled myself up, asking myself what\nI was about. After all, I said, you can take it all in another sense if\nyou like, and it’s more natural so, indeed. I couldn’t help admitting\nit was more natural. I was bothered! ‘No, I’d better get hold of some\nlittle fact’ I said. So when I heard of the bell-ringing, I held my\nbreath and was all in a tremor. ‘Here is my little fact,’ thought I, and\nI didn’t think it over, I simply wouldn’t. I would have given a thousand\nroubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes, when you\nwalked a hundred paces beside that workman, after he had called you\nmurderer to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a question\nall the way. And then what about your trembling, what about your\nbell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium?\n\n“And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I played such pranks on\nyou? And what made you come at that very minute? Someone seemed to\nhave sent you, by Jove! And if Nikolay had not parted us... and do you\nremember Nikolay at the time? Do you remember him clearly? It was a\nthunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt! And how I met him! I didn’t believe\nin the thunderbolt, not for a minute. You could see it for yourself;\nand how could I? Even afterwards, when you had gone and he began making\nvery, very plausible answers on certain points, so that I was surprised\nat him myself, even then I didn’t believe his story! You see what it is\nto be as firm as a rock! No, thought I, _Morgenfrüh_. What has Nikolay\ngot to do with it!”\n\n“Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and had\nyourself assured him of it....”\n\nHis voice failed him, and he broke off. He had been listening in\nindescribable agitation, as this man who had seen through and through\nhim, went back upon himself. He was afraid of believing it and did not\nbelieve it. In those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for\nsomething more definite and conclusive.\n\n“Mr. Razumihin!” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad of a question\nfrom Raskolnikov, who had till then been silent. “He-he-he! But I had to\nput Mr. Razumihin off; two is company, three is none. Mr. Razumihin is\nnot the right man, besides he is an outsider. He came running to me\nwith a pale face.... But never mind him, why bring him in? To return\nto Nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a type he is, how I\nunderstand him, that is? To begin with, he is still a child and not\nexactly a coward, but something by way of an artist. Really, don’t laugh\nat my describing him so. He is innocent and responsive to influence. He\nhas a heart, and is a fantastic fellow. He sings and dances, he tells\nstories, they say, so that people come from other villages to hear him.\nHe attends school too, and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger\nto him; he will drink himself senseless--not as a regular vice, but at\ntimes, when people treat him, like a child. And he stole, too, then,\nwithout knowing it himself, for ‘How can it be stealing, if one picks it\nup?’ And do you know he is an Old Believer, or rather a dissenter? There\nhave been Wanderers[*] in his family, and he was for two years in his\nvillage under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder. I learnt all\nthis from Nikolay and from his fellow villagers. And what’s more, he\nwanted to run into the wilderness! He was full of fervour, prayed at\nnight, read the old books, ‘the true’ ones, and read himself crazy.\n\n     [*] A religious sect.--TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.\n\n“Petersburg had a great effect upon him, especially the women and the\nwine. He responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that. I\nlearnt that an artist here took a fancy to him, and used to go and see\nhim, and now this business came upon him.\n\n“Well, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself! He ran away! How can\none get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceedings? The\nvery word ‘trial’ frightens some of them. Whose fault is it? We shall\nsee what the new juries will do. God grant they do good! Well, in\nprison, it seems, he remembered the venerable elder; the Bible, too,\nmade its appearance again. Do you know, Rodion Romanovitch, the force of\nthe word ‘suffering’ among some of these people! It’s not a question of\nsuffering for someone’s benefit, but simply, ‘one must suffer.’ If they\nsuffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better. In my time\nthere was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison\nalways reading his Bible on the stove at night and he read himself\ncrazy, and so crazy, do you know, that one day, apropos of nothing, he\nseized a brick and flung it at the governor; though he had done him\nno harm. And the way he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side\non purpose, for fear of hurting him. Well, we know what happens to\na prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon. So ‘he took his\nsuffering.’\n\n“So I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his suffering or something\nof the sort. I know it for certain from facts, indeed. Only he doesn’t\nknow that I know. What, you don’t admit that there are such fantastic\npeople among the peasants? Lots of them. The elder now has begun\ninfluencing him, especially since he tried to hang himself. But he’ll\ncome and tell me all himself. You think he’ll hold out? Wait a bit,\nhe’ll take his words back. I am waiting from hour to hour for him to\ncome and abjure his evidence. I have come to like that Nikolay and am\nstudying him in detail. And what do you think? He-he! He answered me\nvery plausibly on some points, he obviously had collected some evidence\nand prepared himself cleverly. But on other points he is simply at sea,\nknows nothing and doesn’t even suspect that he doesn’t know!\n\n“No, Rodion Romanovitch, Nikolay doesn’t come in! This is a fantastic,\ngloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heart\nof man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood ‘renews,’ when\ncomfort is preached as the aim of life. Here we have bookish dreams, a\nheart unhinged by theories. Here we see resolution in the first stage,\nbut resolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping over\na precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the\ncrime. He forgot to shut the door after him, and murdered two people for\na theory. He committed the murder and couldn’t take the money, and what\nhe did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone. It wasn’t enough for\nhim to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and\nrung the bell, no, he had to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, to\nrecall the bell-ringing, he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again....\nWell, that we grant, was through illness, but consider this: he is\na murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, despises others,\nposes as injured innocence. No, that’s not the work of a Nikolay, my\ndear Rodion Romanovitch!”\n\nAll that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that\nthese words were too great a shock. Raskolnikov shuddered as though he\nhad been stabbed.\n\n“Then... who then... is the murderer?” he asked in a breathless voice,\nunable to restrain himself.\n\nPorfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair, as though he were amazed at\nthe question.\n\n“Who is the murderer?” he repeated, as though unable to believe his\nears. “Why, _you_, Rodion Romanovitch! You are the murderer,” he added,\nalmost in a whisper, in a voice of genuine conviction.\n\nRaskolnikov leapt from the sofa, stood up for a few seconds and sat down\nagain without uttering a word. His face twitched convulsively.\n\n“Your lip is twitching just as it did before,” Porfiry Petrovitch\nobserved almost sympathetically. “You’ve been misunderstanding me, I\nthink, Rodion Romanovitch,” he added after a brief pause, “that’s why\nyou are so surprised. I came on purpose to tell you everything and deal\nopenly with you.”\n\n“It was not I murdered her,” Raskolnikov whispered like a frightened\nchild caught in the act.\n\n“No, it was you, you Rodion Romanovitch, and no one else,” Porfiry\nwhispered sternly, with conviction.\n\nThey were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long, about ten\nminutes. Raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers\nthrough his hair. Porfiry Petrovitch sat quietly waiting. Suddenly\nRaskolnikov looked scornfully at Porfiry.\n\n“You are at your old tricks again, Porfiry Petrovitch! Your old method\nagain. I wonder you don’t get sick of it!”\n\n“Oh, stop that, what does that matter now? It would be a different\nmatter if there were witnesses present, but we are whispering alone. You\nsee yourself that I have not come to chase and capture you like a hare.\nWhether you confess it or not is nothing to me now; for myself, I am\nconvinced without it.”\n\n“If so, what did you come for?” Raskolnikov asked irritably. “I ask you\nthe same question again: if you consider me guilty, why don’t you take\nme to prison?”\n\n“Oh, that’s your question! I will answer you, point for point. In the\nfirst place, to arrest you so directly is not to my interest.”\n\n“How so? If you are convinced you ought....”\n\n“Ach, what if I am convinced? That’s only my dream for the time. Why\nshould I put you in safety? You know that’s it, since you ask me to do\nit. If I confront you with that workman for instance and you say to him\n‘were you drunk or not? Who saw me with you? I simply took you to be\ndrunk, and you were drunk, too.’ Well, what could I answer, especially\nas your story is a more likely one than his? for there’s nothing but\npsychology to support his evidence--that’s almost unseemly with his ugly\nmug, while you hit the mark exactly, for the rascal is an inveterate\ndrunkard and notoriously so. And I have myself admitted candidly several\ntimes already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the\nsecond way is stronger and looks far more probable, and that apart from\nthat I have as yet nothing against you. And though I shall put you in\nprison and indeed have come--quite contrary to etiquette--to inform you\nof it beforehand, yet I tell you frankly, also contrary to etiquette,\nthat it won’t be to my advantage. Well, secondly, I’ve come to you\nbecause...”\n\n“Yes, yes, secondly?” Raskolnikov was listening breathless.\n\n“Because, as I told you just now, I consider I owe you an explanation. I\ndon’t want you to look upon me as a monster, as I have a genuine liking\nfor you, you may believe me or not. And in the third place I’ve come to\nyou with a direct and open proposition--that you should surrender\nand confess. It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my\nadvantage too, for my task will be done. Well, is this open on my part\nor not?”\n\nRaskolnikov thought a minute.\n\n“Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch. You said just now you have nothing but\npsychology to go on, yet now you’ve gone on mathematics. Well, what if\nyou are mistaken yourself, now?”\n\n“No, Rodion Romanovitch, I am not mistaken. I have a little fact even\nthen, Providence sent it me.”\n\n“What little fact?”\n\n“I won’t tell you what, Rodion Romanovitch. And in any case, I haven’t\nthe right to put it off any longer, I must arrest you. So think it over:\nit makes no difference to me _now_ and so I speak only for your sake.\nBelieve me, it will be better, Rodion Romanovitch.”\n\nRaskolnikov smiled malignantly.\n\n“That’s not simply ridiculous, it’s positively shameless. Why, even if I\nwere guilty, which I don’t admit, what reason should I have to confess,\nwhen you tell me yourself that I shall be in greater safety in prison?”\n\n“Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don’t put too much faith in words, perhaps\nprison will not be altogether a restful place. That’s only theory and\nmy theory, and what authority am I for you? Perhaps, too, even now I am\nhiding something from you? I can’t lay bare everything, he-he! And how\ncan you ask what advantage? Don’t you know how it would lessen your\nsentence? You would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken\nthe crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case. Consider that! I\nswear before God that I will so arrange that your confession shall\ncome as a complete surprise. We will make a clean sweep of all these\npsychological points, of a suspicion against you, so that your crime\nwill appear to have been something like an aberration, for in truth it\nwas an aberration. I am an honest man, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keep\nmy word.”\n\nRaskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink\ndejectedly. He pondered a long while and at last smiled again, but his\nsmile was sad and gentle.\n\n“No!” he said, apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearances\nwith Porfiry, “it’s not worth it, I don’t care about lessening the\nsentence!”\n\n“That’s just what I was afraid of!” Porfiry cried warmly and, as it\nseemed, involuntarily. “That’s just what I feared, that you wouldn’t\ncare about the mitigation of sentence.”\n\nRaskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him.\n\n“Ah, don’t disdain life!” Porfiry went on. “You have a great deal of\nit still before you. How can you say you don’t want a mitigation of\nsentence? You are an impatient fellow!”\n\n“A great deal of what lies before me?”\n\n“Of life. What sort of prophet are you, do you know much about it? Seek\nand ye shall find. This may be God’s means for bringing you to Him. And\nit’s not for ever, the bondage....”\n\n“The time will be shortened,” laughed Raskolnikov.\n\n“Why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of? It may be that you\nare afraid of it without knowing it, because you are young! But anyway\n_you_ shouldn’t be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing.”\n\n“Ach, hang it!” Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt, as\nthough he did not want to speak aloud.\n\nHe got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat down again in\nevident despair.\n\n“Hang it, if you like! You’ve lost faith and you think that I am\ngrossly flattering you; but how long has your life been? How much do\nyou understand? You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke\ndown and turned out to be not at all original! It turned out something\nbase, that’s true, but you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base!\nAt least you didn’t deceive yourself for long, you went straight to the\nfurthest point at one bound. How do I regard you? I regard you as one\nof those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts\ntheir entrails out, if only they have found faith or God. Find it and\nyou will live. You have long needed a change of air. Suffering, too,\nis a good thing. Suffer! Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer.\nI know you don’t believe in it--but don’t be over-wise; fling yourself\nstraight into life, without deliberation; don’t be afraid--the flood\nwill bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again. What\nbank? How can I tell? I only believe that you have long life before\nyou. I know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared\nbeforehand, but maybe you will remember them after. They may be of use\nsome time. That’s why I speak. It’s as well that you only killed the\nold woman. If you’d invented another theory you might perhaps have\ndone something a thousand times more hideous. You ought to thank God,\nperhaps. How do you know? Perhaps God is saving you for something.\nBut keep a good heart and have less fear! Are you afraid of the great\nexpiation before you? No, it would be shameful to be afraid of it. Since\nyou have taken such a step, you must harden your heart. There is justice\nin it. You must fulfil the demands of justice. I know that you don’t\nbelieve it, but indeed, life will bring you through. You will live it\ndown in time. What you need now is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air!”\n\nRaskolnikov positively started.\n\n“But who are you? what prophet are you? From the height of what majestic\ncalm do you proclaim these words of wisdom?”\n\n“Who am I? I am a man with nothing to hope for, that’s all. A man\nperhaps of feeling and sympathy, maybe of some knowledge too, but my day\nis over. But you are a different matter, there is life waiting for you.\nThough, who knows? maybe your life, too, will pass off in smoke and come\nto nothing. Come, what does it matter, that you will pass into another\nclass of men? It’s not comfort you regret, with your heart! What of\nit that perhaps no one will see you for so long? It’s not time, but\nyourself that will decide that. Be the sun and all will see you. The\nsun has before all to be the sun. Why are you smiling again? At my being\nsuch a Schiller? I bet you’re imagining that I am trying to get round\nyou by flattery. Well, perhaps I am, he-he-he! Perhaps you’d better not\nbelieve my word, perhaps you’d better never believe it altogether--I’m\nmade that way, I confess it. But let me add, you can judge for yourself,\nI think, how far I am a base sort of man and how far I am honest.”\n\n“When do you mean to arrest me?”\n\n“Well, I can let you walk about another day or two. Think it over, my\ndear fellow, and pray to God. It’s more in your interest, believe me.”\n\n“And what if I run away?” asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile.\n\n“No, you won’t run away. A peasant would run away, a fashionable\ndissenter would run away, the flunkey of another man’s thought, for\nyou’ve only to show him the end of your little finger and he’ll be ready\nto believe in anything for the rest of his life. But you’ve ceased to\nbelieve in your theory already, what will you run away with? And what\nwould you do in hiding? It would be hateful and difficult for you, and\nwhat you need more than anything in life is a definite position, an\natmosphere to suit you. And what sort of atmosphere would you have? If\nyou ran away, you’d come back to yourself. _You can’t get on without\nus._ And if I put you in prison--say you’ve been there a month, or two,\nor three--remember my word, you’ll confess of yourself and perhaps to\nyour own surprise. You won’t know an hour beforehand that you are coming\nwith a confession. I am convinced that you will decide, ‘to take your\nsuffering.’ You don’t believe my words now, but you’ll come to it of\nyourself. For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing. Never\nmind my having grown fat, I know all the same. Don’t laugh at it,\nthere’s an idea in suffering, Nikolay is right. No, you won’t run away,\nRodion Romanovitch.”\n\nRaskolnikov got up and took his cap. Porfiry Petrovitch also rose.\n\n“Are you going for a walk? The evening will be fine, if only we don’t\nhave a storm. Though it would be a good thing to freshen the air.”\n\nHe, too, took his cap.\n\n“Porfiry Petrovitch, please don’t take up the notion that I have\nconfessed to you to-day,” Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence.\n“You’re a strange man and I have listened to you from simple curiosity.\nBut I have admitted nothing, remember that!”\n\n“Oh, I know that, I’ll remember. Look at him, he’s trembling! Don’t\nbe uneasy, my dear fellow, have it your own way. Walk about a bit, you\nwon’t be able to walk too far. If anything happens, I have one request\nto make of you,” he added, dropping his voice. “It’s an awkward one, but\nimportant. If anything were to happen (though indeed I don’t believe\nin it and think you quite incapable of it), yet in case you were taken\nduring these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to\nthe business in some other way, in some fantastic fashion--laying hands\non yourself--(it’s an absurd proposition, but you must forgive me for\nit) do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention the\nstone. It will be more generous. Come, till we meet! Good thoughts and\nsound decisions to you!”\n\nPorfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov. The\nlatter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he\ncalculated that Porfiry had reached the street and moved away. Then he\ntoo went hurriedly out of the room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nHe hurried to Svidrigaïlov’s. What he had to hope from that man he\ndid not know. But that man had some hidden power over him. Having once\nrecognised this, he could not rest, and now the time had come.\n\nOn the way, one question particularly worried him: had Svidrigaïlov been\nto Porfiry’s?\n\nAs far as he could judge, he would swear to it, that he had not. He\npondered again and again, went over Porfiry’s visit; no, he hadn’t been,\nof course he hadn’t.\n\nBut if he had not been yet, would he go? Meanwhile, for the present he\nfancied he couldn’t. Why? He could not have explained, but if he could,\nhe would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment. It all\nworried him and at the same time he could not attend to it. Strange to\nsay, none would have believed it perhaps, but he only felt a faint vague\nanxiety about his immediate future. Another, much more important anxiety\ntormented him--it concerned himself, but in a different, more vital way.\nMoreover, he was conscious of immense moral fatigue, though his mind was\nworking better that morning than it had done of late.\n\nAnd was it worth while, after all that had happened, to contend with\nthese new trivial difficulties? Was it worth while, for instance, to\nmanoeuvre that Svidrigaïlov should not go to Porfiry’s? Was it worth\nwhile to investigate, to ascertain the facts, to waste time over anyone\nlike Svidrigaïlov?\n\nOh, how sick he was of it all!\n\nAnd yet he was hastening to Svidrigaïlov; could he be expecting\nsomething _new_ from him, information, or means of escape? Men will\ncatch at straws! Was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together?\nPerhaps it was only fatigue, despair; perhaps it was not Svidrigaïlov\nbut some other whom he needed, and Svidrigaïlov had simply presented\nhimself by chance. Sonia? But what should he go to Sonia for now? To beg\nher tears again? He was afraid of Sonia, too. Sonia stood before him as\nan irrevocable sentence. He must go his own way or hers. At that moment\nespecially he did not feel equal to seeing her. No, would it not be\nbetter to try Svidrigaïlov? And he could not help inwardly owning that\nhe had long felt that he must see him for some reason.\n\nBut what could they have in common? Their very evil-doing could not\nbe of the same kind. The man, moreover, was very unpleasant, evidently\ndepraved, undoubtedly cunning and deceitful, possibly malignant. Such\nstories were told about him. It is true he was befriending Katerina\nIvanovna’s children, but who could tell with what motive and what it\nmeant? The man always had some design, some project.\n\nThere was another thought which had been continually hovering of late\nabout Raskolnikov’s mind, and causing him great uneasiness. It was so\npainful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it. He sometimes\nthought that Svidrigaïlov was dogging his footsteps. Svidrigaïlov had\nfound out his secret and had had designs on Dounia. What if he had them\nstill? Wasn’t it practically certain that he had? And what if, having\nlearnt his secret and so having gained power over him, he were to use it\nas a weapon against Dounia?\n\nThis idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it had never\npresented itself so vividly to him as on his way to Svidrigaïlov.\nThe very thought moved him to gloomy rage. To begin with, this would\ntransform everything, even his own position; he would have at once to\nconfess his secret to Dounia. Would he have to give himself up perhaps\nto prevent Dounia from taking some rash step? The letter? This morning\nDounia had received a letter. From whom could she get letters in\nPetersburg? Luzhin, perhaps? It’s true Razumihin was there to protect\nher, but Razumihin knew nothing of the position. Perhaps it was his duty\nto tell Razumihin? He thought of it with repugnance.\n\nIn any case he must see Svidrigaïlov as soon as possible, he decided\nfinally. Thank God, the details of the interview were of little\nconsequence, if only he could get at the root of the matter; but\nif Svidrigaïlov were capable... if he were intriguing against\nDounia--then...\n\nRaskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month\nthat he could only decide such questions in one way; “then I shall kill\nhim,” he thought in cold despair.\n\nA sudden anguish oppressed his heart, he stood still in the middle of\nthe street and began looking about to see where he was and which way he\nwas going. He found himself in X. Prospect, thirty or forty paces from\nthe Hay Market, through which he had come. The whole second storey of\nthe house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wide\nopen; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were\nfull to overflowing. There were sounds of singing, of clarionet and\nviolin, and the boom of a Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking.\nHe was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X. Prospect,\nwhen suddenly at one of the end windows he saw Svidrigaïlov, sitting\nat a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth.\nRaskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback, almost terrified. Svidrigaïlov\nwas silently watching and scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov\nat once, seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved.\nRaskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but to be looking\nabsent-mindedly away, while he watched him out of the corner of his eye.\nHis heart was beating violently. Yet, it was evident that Svidrigaïlov\ndid not want to be seen. He took the pipe out of his mouth and was on\nthe point of concealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his\nchair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen\nhim, and was watching him. What had passed between them was much the\nsame as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room. A\nsly smile came into Svidrigaïlov’s face and grew broader and\nbroader. Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At last\nSvidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh.\n\n“Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!” he shouted from the\nwindow.\n\nRaskolnikov went up into the tavern. He found Svidrigaïlov in a tiny\nback room, adjoining the saloon in which merchants, clerks and numbers\nof people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the\ndesperate bawling of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls\ncould be heard in the distance. On the table before Svidrigaïlov stood\nan open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In the room he found\nalso a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl\nof eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with\nribbons. In spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some\nservants’ hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment of\nthe organ.\n\n“Come, that’s enough,” Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Raskolnikov’s\nentrance. The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully.\nShe had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful\nexpression in her face.\n\n“Hey, Philip, a glass!” shouted Svidrigaïlov.\n\n“I won’t drink anything,” said Raskolnikov.\n\n“As you like, I didn’t mean it for you. Drink, Katia! I don’t want\nanything more to-day, you can go.” He poured her out a full glass, and\nlaid down a yellow note.\n\nKatia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down,\nin twenty gulps, took the note and kissed Svidrigaïlov’s hand, which he\nallowed quite seriously. She went out of the room and the boy trailed\nafter her with the organ. Both had been brought in from the street.\nSvidrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about him\nwas already, so to speak, on a patriarchal footing; the waiter, Philip,\nwas by now an old friend and very obsequious.\n\nThe door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. Svidrigaïlov was at\nhome in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it. The tavern was\ndirty and wretched, not even second-rate.\n\n“I was going to see you and looking for you,” Raskolnikov began, “but\nI don’t know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X. Prospect\njust now. I never take this turning. I turn to the right from the Hay\nMarket. And this isn’t the way to you. I simply turned and here you are.\nIt is strange!”\n\n“Why don’t you say at once ‘it’s a miracle’?”\n\n“Because it may be only chance.”\n\n“Oh, that’s the way with all you folk,” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “You won’t\nadmit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle! Here you say\nthat it may be only chance. And what cowards they all are here, about\nhaving an opinion of their own, you can’t fancy, Rodion Romanovitch. I\ndon’t mean you, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to\nhave it. That’s how it was you attracted my curiosity.”\n\n“Nothing else?”\n\n“Well, that’s enough, you know,” Svidrigaïlov was obviously exhilarated,\nbut only slightly so, he had not had more than half a glass of wine.\n\n“I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was capable of having\nwhat you call an opinion of my own,” observed Raskolnikov.\n\n“Oh, well, it was a different matter. Everyone has his own plans. And\napropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep\nfor the last two or three days. I told you of this tavern myself, there\nis no miracle in your coming straight here. I explained the way myself,\ntold you where it was, and the hours you could find me here. Do you\nremember?”\n\n“I don’t remember,” answered Raskolnikov with surprise.\n\n“I believe you. I told you twice. The address has been stamped\nmechanically on your memory. You turned this way mechanically and yet\nprecisely according to the direction, though you are not aware of\nit. When I told you then, I hardly hoped you understood me. You give\nyourself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch. And another thing, I’m\nconvinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves\nas they walk. This is a town of crazy people. If only we had scientific\nmen, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable\ninvestigations in Petersburg each in his own line. There are few places\nwhere there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul\nof man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of climate mean so much.\nAnd it’s the administrative centre of all Russia and its character must\nbe reflected on the whole country. But that is neither here nor there\nnow. The point is that I have several times watched you. You walk out\nof your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let it\nsink, and fold your hands behind your back. You look and evidently see\nnothing before nor beside you. At last you begin moving your lips and\ntalking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at\nlast stand still in the middle of the road. That’s not at all the thing.\nSomeone may be watching you besides me, and it won’t do you any good.\nIt’s nothing really to do with me and I can’t cure you, but, of course,\nyou understand me.”\n\n“Do you know that I am being followed?” asked Raskolnikov, looking\ninquisitively at him.\n\n“No, I know nothing about it,” said Svidrigaïlov, seeming surprised.\n\n“Well, then, let us leave me alone,” Raskolnikov muttered, frowning.\n\n“Very good, let us leave you alone.”\n\n“You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and directed me\ntwice to come here to you, why did you hide, and try to get away just\nnow when I looked at the window from the street? I saw it.”\n\n“He-he! And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and\npretended to be asleep, though you were wide awake while I stood in your\ndoorway? I saw it.”\n\n“I may have had... reasons. You know that yourself.”\n\n“And I may have had my reasons, though you don’t know them.”\n\nRaskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned his chin in the\nfingers of his right hand, and stared intently at Svidrigaïlov. For a\nfull minute he scrutinised his face, which had impressed him before. It\nwas a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips,\nwith a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair. His eyes were somehow\ntoo blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. There was\nsomething awfully unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked so\nwonderfully young for his age. Svidrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light\nsummer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen. He wore a huge\nring with a precious stone in it.\n\n“Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?” said Raskolnikov\nsuddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point. “Even\nthough perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me,\nI don’t want to put myself out any more. I will show you at once that I\ndon’t prize myself as you probably think I do. I’ve come to tell you at\nonce that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister\nand if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has\nbeen discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up.\nYou can reckon on my word. You know that I can keep it. And in the\nsecond place if you want to tell me anything--for I keep fancying all\nthis time that you have something to tell me--make haste and tell it,\nfor time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late.”\n\n“Why in such haste?” asked Svidrigaïlov, looking at him curiously.\n\n“Everyone has his plans,” Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently.\n\n“You urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the first question\nyou refuse to answer,” Svidrigaïlov observed with a smile. “You\nkeep fancying that I have aims of my own and so you look at me with\nsuspicion. Of course it’s perfectly natural in your position. But\nthough I should like to be friends with you, I shan’t trouble myself\nto convince you of the contrary. The game isn’t worth the candle and I\nwasn’t intending to talk to you about anything special.”\n\n“What did you want me, for, then? It was you who came hanging about me.”\n\n“Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation. I liked the\nfantastic nature of your position--that’s what it was! Besides you are\nthe brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that person\nI had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which I\ngathered that you had a great influence over her; isn’t that enough?\nHa-ha-ha! Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, and\nis difficult for me to answer. Here, you, for instance, have come to me\nnot only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing something\nnew. Isn’t that so? Isn’t that so?” persisted Svidrigaïlov with a sly\nsmile. “Well, can’t you fancy then that I, too, on my way here in the\ntrain was reckoning on you, on your telling me something new, and on my\nmaking some profit out of you! You see what rich men we are!”\n\n“What profit could you make?”\n\n“How can I tell you? How do I know? You see in what a tavern I spend all\nmy time and it’s my enjoyment, that’s to say it’s no great enjoyment,\nbut one must sit somewhere; that poor Katia now--you saw her?... If only\nI had been a glutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this.”\n\nHe pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a\nterrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish.\n\n“Have you dined, by the way? I’ve had something and want nothing more.\nI don’t drink, for instance, at all. Except for champagne I never touch\nanything, and not more than a glass of that all the evening, and even\nthat is enough to make my head ache. I ordered it just now to wind\nmyself up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in a\npeculiar state of mind. That was why I hid myself just now like a\nschoolboy, for I was afraid you would hinder me. But I believe,” he\npulled out his watch, “I can spend an hour with you. It’s half-past\nfour now. If only I’d been something, a landowner, a father, a cavalry\nofficer, a photographer, a journalist... I am nothing, no specialty,\nand sometimes I am positively bored. I really thought you would tell me\nsomething new.”\n\n“But what are you, and why have you come here?”\n\n“What am I? You know, a gentleman, I served for two years in the\ncavalry, then I knocked about here in Petersburg, then I married Marfa\nPetrovna and lived in the country. There you have my biography!”\n\n“You are a gambler, I believe?”\n\n“No, a poor sort of gambler. A card-sharper--not a gambler.”\n\n“You have been a card-sharper then?”\n\n“Yes, I’ve been a card-sharper too.”\n\n“Didn’t you get thrashed sometimes?”\n\n“It did happen. Why?”\n\n“Why, you might have challenged them... altogether it must have been\nlively.”\n\n“I won’t contradict you, and besides I am no hand at philosophy. I\nconfess that I hastened here for the sake of the women.”\n\n“As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna?”\n\n“Quite so,” Svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour. “What of it? You\nseem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women?”\n\n“You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?”\n\n“Vice! Oh, that’s what you are after! But I’ll answer you in order,\nfirst about women in general; you know I am fond of talking. Tell me,\nwhat should I restrain myself for? Why should I give up women, since I\nhave a passion for them? It’s an occupation, anyway.”\n\n“So you hope for nothing here but vice?”\n\n“Oh, very well, for vice then. You insist on its being vice. But anyway\nI like a direct question. In this vice at least there is something\npermanent, founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy,\nsomething present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for ever\nsetting one on fire and, maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even\nwith years. You’ll agree it’s an occupation of a sort.”\n\n“That’s nothing to rejoice at, it’s a disease and a dangerous one.”\n\n“Oh, that’s what you think, is it! I agree, that it is a disease like\neverything that exceeds moderation. And, of course, in this one must\nexceed moderation. But in the first place, everybody does so in one way\nor another, and in the second place, of course, one ought to be moderate\nand prudent, however mean it may be, but what am I to do? If I hadn’t\nthis, I might have to shoot myself. I am ready to admit that a decent\nman ought to put up with being bored, but yet...”\n\n“And could you shoot yourself?”\n\n“Oh, come!” Svidrigaïlov parried with disgust. “Please don’t speak of\nit,” he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown\nin all the previous conversation. His face quite changed. “I admit it’s\nan unpardonable weakness, but I can’t help it. I am afraid of death and\nI dislike its being talked of. Do you know that I am to a certain extent\na mystic?”\n\n“Ah, the apparitions of Marfa Petrovna! Do they still go on visiting\nyou?”\n\n“Oh, don’t talk of them; there have been no more in Petersburg, confound\nthem!” he cried with an air of irritation. “Let’s rather talk of that...\nthough... H’m! I have not much time, and can’t stay long with you,\nit’s a pity! I should have found plenty to tell you.”\n\n“What’s your engagement, a woman?”\n\n“Yes, a woman, a casual incident.... No, that’s not what I want to talk\nof.”\n\n“And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surroundings, doesn’t\nthat affect you? Have you lost the strength to stop yourself?”\n\n“And do you pretend to strength, too? He-he-he! You surprised me just\nnow, Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew beforehand it would be so.\nYou preach to me about vice and æsthetics! You--a Schiller, you--an\nidealist! Of course that’s all as it should be and it would be\nsurprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality.... Ah,\nwhat a pity I have no time, for you’re a most interesting type! And,\nby-the-way, are you fond of Schiller? I am awfully fond of him.”\n\n“But what a braggart you are,” Raskolnikov said with some disgust.\n\n“Upon my word, I am not,” answered Svidrigaïlov laughing. “However, I\nwon’t dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts no\none? I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when\nI come across an intelligent person like you--intelligent and highly\ninteresting--I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I’ve drunk that\nhalf-glass of champagne and it’s gone to my head a little. And besides,\nthere’s a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously, but about that\nI... will keep quiet. Where are you off to?” he asked in alarm.\n\nRaskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed and stifled and,\nas it were, ill at ease at having come here. He felt convinced that\nSvidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth.\n\n“A-ach! Sit down, stay a little!” Svidrigaïlov begged. “Let them bring\nyou some tea, anyway. Stay a little, I won’t talk nonsense, about\nmyself, I mean. I’ll tell you something. If you like I’ll tell you how a\nwoman tried ‘to save’ me, as you would call it? It will be an answer to\nyour first question indeed, for the woman was your sister. May I tell\nyou? It will help to spend the time.”\n\n“Tell me, but I trust that you...”\n\n“Oh, don’t be uneasy. Besides, even in a worthless low fellow like me,\nAvdotya Romanovna can only excite the deepest respect.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n“You know perhaps--yes, I told you myself,” began Svidrigaïlov, “that\nI was in the debtors’ prison here, for an immense sum, and had not\nany expectation of being able to pay it. There’s no need to go into\nparticulars how Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a\npoint of insanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest woman,\nand very sensible, although completely uneducated. Would you believe\nthat this honest and jealous woman, after many scenes of hysterics and\nreproaches, condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which\nshe kept throughout our married life? She was considerably older than\nI, and besides, she always kept a clove or something in her mouth. There\nwas so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as to\ntell her straight out that I couldn’t be absolutely faithful to her.\nThis confession drove her to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have\nliked my brutal frankness. She thought it showed I was unwilling to\ndeceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous\nwoman, you know, that’s the first consideration. After many tears an\nunwritten contract was drawn up between us: first, that I would never\nleave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband; secondly, that I\nwould never absent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I would\nnever set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for this, Marfa\nPetrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants, but only with her\nsecret knowledge; fifthly, God forbid my falling in love with a woman of\nour class; sixthly, in case I--which God forbid--should be visited by\na great serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna. On\nthis last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease. She was a\nsensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute\nprofligate incapable of real love. But a sensible woman and a jealous\nwoman are two very different things, and that’s where the trouble\ncame in. But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain\npreconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people\nabout us. I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than\nin anyone’s. Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was\nridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna. She certainly had some very\nridiculous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the\ninnumerable woes of which I was the cause. Well, and that’s enough, I\nthink, by way of a decorous _oraison funèbre_ for the most tender wife\nof a most tender husband. When we quarrelled, I usually held my tongue\nand did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to\nattain its object, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed. These were\ntimes when she was positively proud of me. But your sister she couldn’t\nput up with, anyway. And however she came to risk taking such a\nbeautiful creature into her house as a governess. My explanation is that\nMarfa Petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell\nin love herself--literally fell in love--with your sister. Well, little\nwonder--look at Avdotya Romanovna! I saw the danger at the first glance\nand what do you think, I resolved not to look at her even. But Avdotya\nRomanovna herself made the first step, would you believe it? Would you\nbelieve it too that Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first\nfor my persistent silence about your sister, for my careless reception\nof her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna. I don’t know\nwhat it was she wanted! Well, of course, Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya\nRomanovna every detail about me. She had the unfortunate habit of\ntelling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually\ncomplaining of me; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful\nnew friend? I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt\nAvdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were\ncurrent about me.... I don’t mind betting that you too have heard\nsomething of the sort already?”\n\n“I have. Luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child. Is\nthat true?”\n\n“Don’t refer to those vulgar tales, I beg,” said Svidrigaïlov with\ndisgust and annoyance. “If you insist on wanting to know about all that\nidiocy, I will tell you one day, but now...”\n\n“I was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you\ntreated badly.”\n\n“I beg you to drop the subject,” Svidrigaïlov interrupted again with\nobvious impatience.\n\n“Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe?...\nyou told me about it yourself.” Raskolnikov felt more and more\nirritated.\n\nSvidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caught\na flash of spiteful mockery in that look. But Svidrigaïlov restrained\nhimself and answered very civilly:\n\n“Yes, it was. I see that you, too, are extremely interested and shall\nfeel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity. Upon\nmy soul! I see that I really might pass for a romantic figure with\nsome people. Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having\nrepeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip\nabout me. I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but in any\ncase it worked in my interests. With all Avdotya Romanovna’s natural\naversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect--she\ndid at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul. And if once a\ngirl’s heart is moved to _pity_, it’s more dangerous than anything. She\nis bound to want to ‘save him,’ to bring him to his senses, and lift\nhim up and draw him to nobler aims, and restore him to new life and\nusefulness--well, we all know how far such dreams can go. I saw at once\nthat the bird was flying into the cage of herself. And I too made ready.\nI think you are frowning, Rodion Romanovitch? There’s no need. As you\nknow, it all ended in smoke. (Hang it all, what a lot I am drinking!)\nDo you know, I always, from the very beginning, regretted that it wasn’t\nyour sister’s fate to be born in the second or third century A.D., as\nthe daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in Asia\nMinor. She would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure\nmartyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot\npincers. And she would have gone to it of herself. And in the fourth or\nfifth century she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and\nwould have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and\nvisions. She is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone, and\nif she can’t get her torture, she’ll throw herself out of a window. I’ve\nheard something of a Mr. Razumihin--he’s said to be a sensible fellow;\nhis surname suggests it, indeed. He’s probably a divinity student. Well,\nhe’d better look after your sister! I believe I understand her, and I am\nproud of it. But at the beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one\nis apt to be more heedless and stupid. One doesn’t see clearly. Hang it\nall, why is she so handsome? It’s not my fault. In fact, it began on\nmy side with a most irresistible physical desire. Avdotya Romanovna is\nawfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so. Take note, I tell you\nthis about your sister as a fact. She is almost morbidly chaste, in\nspite of her broad intelligence, and it will stand in her way. There\nhappened to be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed\nwench, whom I had never seen before--she had just come from another\nvillage--very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst into tears,\nwailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal.\nOne day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue in\nthe garden and with flashing eyes _insisted_ on my leaving poor Parasha\nalone. It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. I, of course,\nwas only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to appear disconcerted,\nembarrassed, in fact played my part not badly. Then came interviews,\nmysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even\ntears--would you believe it, even tears? Think what the passion for\npropaganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on\nmy destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally\nresorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the\nfemale heart, a weapon which never fails one. It’s the well-known\nresource--flattery. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the\ntruth and nothing easier than flattery. If there’s the hundredth part\nof a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that\nleads to trouble. But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it\nis just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction. It may be\na coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the\nflattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. That’s so for all\nstages of development and classes of society. A vestal virgin might be\nseduced by flattery. I can never remember without laughter how I once\nseduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and her\nprinciples. What fun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really\nhad principles--of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply being\nutterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I flattered her\nshamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure of\nthe hand, even a glance from her, I would reproach myself for having\nsnatched it by force, and would declare that she had resisted, so that\nI could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.\nI maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my\ntreachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on. In\nfact, I triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was\ninnocent, chaste, and faithful to all her duties and obligations and\nhad succumbed quite by accident. And how angry she was with me when I\nexplained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was\njust as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of\nflattery, and if I had only cared to, I might have had all her property\nsettled on me during her lifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine\nnow and talking too much.) I hope you won’t be angry if I mention now\nthat I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna.\nBut I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all. Avdotya Romanovna had\nseveral times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased by\nthe expression of my eyes, would you believe it? There was sometimes a\nlight in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and\nmore unguarded till it was hateful to her. No need to go into detail,\nbut we parted. There I acted stupidly again. I fell to jeering in the\ncoarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha\ncame on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a\ntremendous to-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how your\nsister’s eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my being drunk at this\nmoment and having had a whole glass of wine. I am speaking the truth.\nI assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of\nher dress was more than I could stand at last. I really began to think\nthat I might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I could\nbe moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled,\nbut by then it was impossible. And imagine what I did then! To what\na pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy! Never undertake\nanything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya\nRomanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that’s not the word...\nbut does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she lived by\nher work, that she had her mother and you to keep (ach, hang it, you\nare frowning again), and I resolved to offer her all my money--thirty\nthousand roubles I could have realised then--if she would run away with\nme here, to Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love,\nrapture, and so on. Do you know, I was so wild about her at that time\nthat if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat\nand to marry herself, it would have been done at once! But it ended in\nthe catastrophe of which you know already. You can fancy how frantic I\nwas when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly\nattorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them--which would\nreally have been just the same thing as I was proposing. Wouldn’t it?\nWouldn’t it? I notice that you’ve begun to be very attentive... you\ninteresting young man....”\n\nSvidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently. He was flushed.\nRaskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne\nthat he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him--and he\nresolved to take advantage of the opportunity. He felt very suspicious\nof Svidrigaïlov.\n\n“Well, after what you have said, I am fully convinced that you have\ncome to Petersburg with designs on my sister,” he said directly to\nSvidrigaïlov, in order to irritate him further.\n\n“Oh, nonsense,” said Svidrigaïlov, seeming to rouse himself. “Why, I\ntold you... besides your sister can’t endure me.”\n\n“Yes, I am certain that she can’t, but that’s not the point.”\n\n“Are you so sure that she can’t?” Svidrigaïlov screwed up his eyes and\nsmiled mockingly. “You are right, she doesn’t love me, but you can\nnever be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and\nmistress. There’s always a little corner which remains a secret to\nthe world and is only known to those two. Will you answer for it that\nAvdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion?”\n\n“From some words you’ve dropped, I notice that you still have\ndesigns--and of course evil ones--on Dounia and mean to carry them out\npromptly.”\n\n“What, have I dropped words like that?” Svidrigaïlov asked in naïve\ndismay, taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his\ndesigns.\n\n“Why, you are dropping them even now. Why are you so frightened? What\nare you so afraid of now?”\n\n“Me--afraid? Afraid of you? You have rather to be afraid of me, _cher\nami_. But what nonsense.... I’ve drunk too much though, I see that. I\nwas almost saying too much again. Damn the wine! Hi! there, water!”\n\nHe snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of\nthe window. Philip brought the water.\n\n“That’s all nonsense!” said Svidrigaïlov, wetting a towel and putting it\nto his head. “But I can answer you in one word and annihilate all your\nsuspicions. Do you know that I am going to get married?”\n\n“You told me so before.”\n\n“Did I? I’ve forgotten. But I couldn’t have told you so for certain for\nI had not even seen my betrothed; I only meant to. But now I really\nhave a betrothed and it’s a settled thing, and if it weren’t that I have\nbusiness that can’t be put off, I would have taken you to see them\nat once, for I should like to ask your advice. Ach, hang it, only ten\nminutes left! See, look at the watch. But I must tell you, for it’s an\ninteresting story, my marriage, in its own way. Where are you off to?\nGoing again?”\n\n“No, I’m not going away now.”\n\n“Not at all? We shall see. I’ll take you there, I’ll show you my\nbetrothed, only not now. For you’ll soon have to be off. You have to go\nto the right and I to the left. Do you know that Madame Resslich, the\nwoman I am lodging with now, eh? I know what you’re thinking, that she’s\nthe woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter. Come, are\nyou listening? She arranged it all for me. You’re bored, she said,\nyou want something to fill up your time. For, you know, I am a gloomy,\ndepressed person. Do you think I’m light-hearted? No, I’m gloomy. I do\nno harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a\ntime. And that Resslich is a sly hussy, I tell you. I know what she has\ngot in her mind; she thinks I shall get sick of it, abandon my wife and\ndepart, and she’ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her--in our\nclass, of course, or higher. She told me the father was a broken-down\nretired official, who has been sitting in a chair for the last three\nyears with his legs paralysed. The mamma, she said, was a sensible\nwoman. There is a son serving in the provinces, but he doesn’t help;\nthere is a daughter, who is married, but she doesn’t visit them. And\nthey’ve two little nephews on their hands, as though their own children\nwere not enough, and they’ve taken from school their youngest daughter,\na girl who’ll be sixteen in another month, so that then she can be\nmarried. She was for me. We went there. How funny it was! I present\nmyself--a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections,\nwith a fortune. What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinks\nof that? But it’s fascinating, isn’t it? It is fascinating, ha-ha! You\nshould have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. It was worth paying\nto have seen me at that moment. She comes in, curtseys, you can fancy,\nstill in a short frock--an unopened bud! Flushing like a sunset--she had\nbeen told, no doubt. I don’t know how you feel about female faces, but\nto my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tears\nof bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect little\npicture, too. Fair hair in little curls, like a lamb’s, full little rosy\nlips, tiny feet, a charmer!... Well, we made friends. I told them I was\nin a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that is\nthe day before yesterday, we were betrothed. When I go now I take her on\nmy knee at once and keep her there.... Well, she flushes like a sunset\nand I kiss her every minute. Her mamma of course impresses on her that\nthis is her husband and that this must be so. It’s simply delicious! The\npresent betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage. Here you\nhave what is called _la nature et la vérité_, ha-ha! I’ve talked to her\ntwice, she is far from a fool. Sometimes she steals a look at me that\npositively scorches me. Her face is like Raphael’s Madonna. You know,\nthe Sistine Madonna’s face has something fantastic in it, the face\nof mournful religious ecstasy. Haven’t you noticed it? Well, she’s\nsomething in that line. The day after we’d been betrothed, I bought her\npresents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles--a set of diamonds and\nanother of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, with all\nsorts of things in it, so that even my Madonna’s face glowed. I sat her\non my knee, yesterday, and I suppose rather too unceremoniously--she\nflushed crimson and the tears started, but she didn’t want to show it.\nWe were left alone, she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the first\ntime of her own accord), put her little arms round me, kissed me, and\nvowed that she would be an obedient, faithful, and good wife, would make\nme happy, would devote all her life, every minute of her life, would\nsacrifice everything, everything, and that all she asks in return is\nmy _respect_, and that she wants ‘nothing, nothing more from me, no\npresents.’ You’ll admit that to hear such a confession, alone, from an\nangel of sixteen in a muslin frock, with little curls, with a flush\nof maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is\nrather fascinating! Isn’t it fascinating? It’s worth paying for, isn’t\nit? Well... listen, we’ll go to see my betrothed, only not just now!”\n\n“The fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites\nyour sensuality! Will you really make such a marriage?”\n\n“Why, of course. Everyone thinks of himself, and he lives most gaily who\nknows best how to deceive himself. Ha-ha! But why are you so keen about\nvirtue? Have mercy on me, my good friend. I am a sinful man. Ha-ha-ha!”\n\n“But you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna. Though...\nthough you had your own reasons.... I understand it all now.”\n\n“I am always fond of children, very fond of them,” laughed Svidrigaïlov.\n“I can tell you one curious instance of it. The first day I came here I\nvisited various haunts, after seven years I simply rushed at them. You\nprobably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my\nold friends. I shall do without them as long as I can. Do you know, when\nI was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted by the thought\nof these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great\ndeal. Yes, upon my soul! The peasants have vodka, the educated young\npeople, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams\nand visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and are\namassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery. From\nthe first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours. I chanced to be\nin a frightful den--I like my dens dirty--it was a dance, so called, and\nthere was a _cancan_ such as I never saw in my day. Yes, there you\nhave progress. All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely\ndressed, dancing with a specialist in that line, with another one\n_vis-à-vis_. Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall. You can’t\nfancy what a _cancan_ that was! The girl was ashamed, blushed, at\nlast felt insulted, and began to cry. Her partner seized her and began\nwhirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and--I\nlike your public, even the _cancan_ public--they laughed and shouted,\n‘Serves her right--serves her right! Shouldn’t bring children!’ Well,\nit’s not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or\nnot. I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the mother, and began by\nsaying that I too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and\nthat they couldn’t distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect,\ngave her to understand that I had plenty of money, offered to take them\nhome in my carriage. I took them home and got to know them. They were\nlodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the\ncountry. She told me that she and her daughter could only regard my\nacquaintance as an honour. I found out that they had nothing of their\nown and had come to town upon some legal business. I proffered my\nservices and money. I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon\nby mistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing class. I offered to\nassist in the young girl’s education in French and dancing. My offer was\naccepted with enthusiasm as an honour--and we are still friendly.... If\nyou like, we’ll go and see them, only not just now.”\n\n“Stop! Enough of your vile, nasty anecdotes, depraved vile, sensual\nman!”\n\n“Schiller, you are a regular Schiller! _O la vertu va-t-elle se nicher?_\nBut you know I shall tell you these things on purpose, for the pleasure\nof hearing your outcries!”\n\n“I dare say. I can see I am ridiculous myself,” muttered Raskolnikov\nangrily.\n\nSvidrigaïlov laughed heartily; finally he called Philip, paid his bill,\nand began getting up.\n\n“I say, but I am drunk, _assez causé_,” he said. “It’s been a pleasure.”\n\n“I should rather think it must be a pleasure!” cried Raskolnikov,\ngetting up. “No doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate to\ndescribe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in\nhis mind--especially under such circumstances and to such a man as\nme.... It’s stimulating!”\n\n“Well, if you come to that,” Svidrigaïlov answered, scrutinising\nRaskolnikov with some surprise, “if you come to that, you are a thorough\ncynic yourself. You’ve plenty to make you so, anyway. You can understand\na great deal... and you can do a great deal too. But enough. I sincerely\nregret not having had more talk with you, but I shan’t lose sight of\nyou.... Only wait a bit.”\n\nSvidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant. Raskolnikov walked out after\nhim. Svidrigaïlov was not however very drunk, the wine had affected him\nfor a moment, but it was passing off every minute. He was preoccupied\nwith something of importance and was frowning. He was apparently excited\nand uneasy in anticipation of something. His manner to Raskolnikov had\nchanged during the last few minutes, and he was ruder and more sneering\nevery moment. Raskolnikov noticed all this, and he too was uneasy. He\nbecame very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him.\n\nThey came out on to the pavement.\n\n“You go to the right, and I to the left, or if you like, the other way.\nOnly _adieu, mon plaisir_, may we meet again.”\n\nAnd he walked to the right towards the Hay Market.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nRaskolnikov walked after him.\n\n“What’s this?” cried Svidrigaïlov turning round, “I thought I said...”\n\n“It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now.”\n\n“What?”\n\nBoth stood still and gazed at one another, as though measuring their\nstrength.\n\n“From all your half tipsy stories,” Raskolnikov observed harshly, “I am\n_positive_ that you have not given up your designs on my sister, but\nare pursuing them more actively than ever. I have learnt that my sister\nreceived a letter this morning. You have hardly been able to sit still\nall this time.... You may have unearthed a wife on the way, but that\nmeans nothing. I should like to make certain myself.”\n\nRaskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he\nwished to make certain.\n\n“Upon my word! I’ll call the police!”\n\n“Call away!”\n\nAgain they stood for a minute facing each other. At last Svidrigaïlov’s\nface changed. Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was not\nfrightened at his threat, he assumed a mirthful and friendly air.\n\n“What a fellow! I purposely refrained from referring to your affair,\nthough I am devoured by curiosity. It’s a fantastic affair. I’ve put it\noff till another time, but you’re enough to rouse the dead.... Well, let\nus go, only I warn you beforehand I am only going home for a moment,\nto get some money; then I shall lock up the flat, take a cab and go to\nspend the evening at the Islands. Now, now are you going to follow me?”\n\n“I’m coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna, to\nsay I’m sorry not to have been at the funeral.”\n\n“That’s as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. She has taken\nthe three children to an old lady of high rank, the patroness of some\norphan asylums, whom I used to know years ago. I charmed the old lady by\ndepositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three children of\nKaterina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well. I told her\ntoo the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, suppressing nothing.\nIt produced an indescribable effect on her. That’s why Sofya Semyonovna\nhas been invited to call to-day at the X. Hotel where the lady is\nstaying for the time.”\n\n“No matter, I’ll come all the same.”\n\n“As you like, it’s nothing to me, but I won’t come with you; here we are\nat home. By the way, I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion\njust because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled\nyou with questions... you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; I\ndon’t mind betting it’s that. Well, it teaches one to show delicacy!”\n\n“And to listen at doors!”\n\n“Ah, that’s it, is it?” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “Yes, I should have been\nsurprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened. Ha-ha!\nThough I did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and\nwere telling Sofya Semyonovna about, what was the meaning of it? Perhaps\nI am quite behind the times and can’t understand. For goodness’ sake,\nexplain it, my dear boy. Expound the latest theories!”\n\n“You couldn’t have heard anything. You’re making it all up!”\n\n“But I’m not talking about that (though I did hear something). No, I’m\ntalking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now. The Schiller in\nyou is in revolt every moment, and now you tell me not to listen at\ndoors. If that’s how you feel, go and inform the police that you had\nthis mischance: you made a little mistake in your theory. But if you are\nconvinced that one mustn’t listen at doors, but one may murder old women\nat one’s pleasure, you’d better be off to America and make haste. Run,\nyoung man! There may still be time. I’m speaking sincerely. Haven’t you\nthe money? I’ll give you the fare.”\n\n“I’m not thinking of that at all,” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust.\n\n“I understand (but don’t put yourself out, don’t discuss it if you don’t\nwant to). I understand the questions you are worrying over--moral ones,\naren’t they? Duties of citizen and man? Lay them all aside. They are\nnothing to you now, ha-ha! You’ll say you are still a man and a citizen.\nIf so you ought not to have got into this coil. It’s no use taking up a\njob you are not fit for. Well, you’d better shoot yourself, or don’t you\nwant to?”\n\n“You seem trying to enrage me, to make me leave you.”\n\n“What a queer fellow! But here we are. Welcome to the staircase. You\nsee, that’s the way to Sofya Semyonovna. Look, there is no one at home.\nDon’t you believe me? Ask Kapernaumov. She leaves the key with him. Here\nis Madame de Kapernaumov herself. Hey, what? She is rather deaf. Has she\ngone out? Where? Did you hear? She is not in and won’t be till late in\nthe evening probably. Well, come to my room; you wanted to come and see\nme, didn’t you? Here we are. Madame Resslich’s not at home. She is a\nwoman who is always busy, an excellent woman I assure you.... She might\nhave been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible. Now,\nsee! I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau--see what a lot\nI’ve got of them still--this one will be turned into cash to-day. I\nmustn’t waste any more time. The bureau is locked, the flat is locked,\nand here we are again on the stairs. Shall we take a cab? I’m going to\nthe Islands. Would you like a lift? I’ll take this carriage. Ah, you\nrefuse? You are tired of it! Come for a drive! I believe it will come on\nto rain. Never mind, we’ll put down the hood....”\n\nSvidrigaïlov was already in the carriage. Raskolnikov decided that his\nsuspicions were at least for that moment unjust. Without answering a\nword he turned and walked back towards the Hay Market. If he had only\nturned round on his way he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not a\nhundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement. But he\nhad turned the corner and could see nothing. Intense disgust drew him\naway from Svidrigaïlov.\n\n“To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that\ncoarse brute, that depraved sensualist and blackguard!” he cried.\n\nRaskolnikov’s judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there was\nsomething about Svidrigaïlov which gave him a certain original, even a\nmysterious character. As concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convinced\nthat Svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace. But it was too tiresome\nand unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this.\n\nWhen he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before he sank, as\nusual, into deep thought. On the bridge he stood by the railing and\nbegan gazing at the water. And his sister was standing close by him.\n\nHe met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by without seeing\nher. Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was\nstruck with dismay. She stood still and did not know whether to call\nto him or not. Suddenly she saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the\ndirection of the Hay Market.\n\nHe seemed to be approaching cautiously. He did not go on to the\nbridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing all he could to avoid\nRaskolnikov’s seeing him. He had observed Dounia for some time and had\nbeen making signs to her. She fancied he was signalling to beg her not\nto speak to her brother, but to come to him.\n\nThat was what Dounia did. She stole by her brother and went up to\nSvidrigaïlov.\n\n“Let us make haste away,” Svidrigaïlov whispered to her, “I don’t want\nRodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting. I must tell you I’ve been\nsitting with him in the restaurant close by, where he looked me up and\nI had great difficulty in getting rid of him. He has somehow heard of\nmy letter to you and suspects something. It wasn’t you who told him, of\ncourse, but if not you, who then?”\n\n“Well, we’ve turned the corner now,” Dounia interrupted, “and my brother\nwon’t see us. I have to tell you that I am going no further with you.\nSpeak to me here. You can tell it all in the street.”\n\n“In the first place, I can’t say it in the street; secondly, you must\nhear Sofya Semyonovna too; and, thirdly, I will show you some papers....\nOh well, if you won’t agree to come with me, I shall refuse to give\nany explanation and go away at once. But I beg you not to forget that\na very curious secret of your beloved brother’s is entirely in my\nkeeping.”\n\nDounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at Svidrigaïlov with\nsearching eyes.\n\n“What are you afraid of?” he observed quietly. “The town is not the\ncountry. And even in the country you did me more harm than I did you.”\n\n“Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?”\n\n“No, I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she\nis at home now. But most likely she is. She has buried her stepmother\nto-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day. For the time I\ndon’t want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken\nto you. The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like\nthis. I live there in that house, we are coming to it. That’s the porter\nof our house--he knows me very well; you see, he’s bowing; he sees I’m\ncoming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you\nwill be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious. Excuse\nmy putting things so coarsely. I haven’t a flat to myself; Sofya\nSemyonovna’s room is next to mine--she lodges in the next flat. The\nwhole floor is let out in lodgings. Why are you frightened like a child?\nAm I really so terrible?”\n\nSvidrigaïlov’s lips were twisted in a condescending smile; but he was in\nno smiling mood. His heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe.\nHe spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement. But Dounia did not\nnotice this peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark that\nshe was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to\nher.\n\n“Though I know that you are not a man... of honour, I am not in the\nleast afraid of you. Lead the way,” she said with apparent composure,\nbut her face was very pale.\n\nSvidrigaïlov stopped at Sonia’s room.\n\n“Allow me to inquire whether she is at home.... She is not. How\nunfortunate! But I know she may come quite soon. If she’s gone out, it\ncan only be to see a lady about the orphans. Their mother is dead....\nI’ve been meddling and making arrangements for them. If Sofya Semyonovna\ndoes not come back in ten minutes, I will send her to you, to-day if\nyou like. This is my flat. These are my two rooms. Madame Resslich,\nmy landlady, has the next room. Now, look this way. I will show you\nmy chief piece of evidence: this door from my bedroom leads into two\nperfectly empty rooms, which are to let. Here they are... You must look\ninto them with some attention.”\n\nSvidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms. Dounia was\nlooking about her mistrustfully, but saw nothing special in the\nfurniture or position of the rooms. Yet there was something to observe,\nfor instance, that Svidrigaïlov’s flat was exactly between two sets of\nalmost uninhabited apartments. His rooms were not entered directly\nfrom the passage, but through the landlady’s two almost empty rooms.\nUnlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svidrigaïlov showed Dounia\nthe two empty rooms that were to let. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not\nknowing what she was called to look upon, but Svidrigaïlov hastened to\nexplain.\n\n“Look here, at this second large room. Notice that door, it’s locked.\nBy the door stands a chair, the only one in the two rooms. I brought it\nfrom my rooms so as to listen more conveniently. Just the other side of\nthe door is Sofya Semyonovna’s table; she sat there talking to Rodion\nRomanovitch. And I sat here listening on two successive evenings, for\ntwo hours each time--and of course I was able to learn something, what\ndo you think?”\n\n“You listened?”\n\n“Yes, I did. Now come back to my room; we can’t sit down here.”\n\nHe brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her\na chair. He sat down at the opposite side of the table, at least seven\nfeet from her, but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which\nhad once frightened Dounia so much. She shuddered and once more looked\nabout her distrustfully. It was an involuntary gesture; she evidently\ndid not wish to betray her uneasiness. But the secluded position of\nSvidrigaïlov’s lodging had suddenly struck her. She wanted to ask\nwhether his landlady at least were at home, but pride kept her from\nasking. Moreover, she had another trouble in her heart incomparably\ngreater than fear for herself. She was in great distress.\n\n“Here is your letter,” she said, laying it on the table. “Can it be true\nwhat you write? You hint at a crime committed, you say, by my brother.\nYou hint at it too clearly; you daren’t deny it now. I must tell you\nthat I’d heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don’t believe a\nword of it. It’s a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion. I know the story\nand why and how it was invented. You can have no proofs. You promised to\nprove it. Speak! But let me warn you that I don’t believe you! I don’t\nbelieve you!”\n\nDounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant the colour\nrushed to her face.\n\n“If you didn’t believe it, how could you risk coming alone to my rooms?\nWhy have you come? Simply from curiosity?”\n\n“Don’t torment me. Speak, speak!”\n\n“There’s no denying that you are a brave girl. Upon my word, I thought\nyou would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here. But he was not\nwith you nor anywhere near. I was on the look-out. It’s spirited of\nyou, it proves you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch. But everything\nis divine in you.... About your brother, what am I to say to you? You’ve\njust seen him yourself. What did you think of him?”\n\n“Surely that’s not the only thing you are building on?”\n\n“No, not on that, but on his own words. He came here on two successive\nevenings to see Sofya Semyonovna. I’ve shown you where they sat. He made\na full confession to her. He is a murderer. He killed an old woman, a\npawnbroker, with whom he had pawned things himself. He killed her sister\ntoo, a pedlar woman called Lizaveta, who happened to come in while he\nwas murdering her sister. He killed them with an axe he brought with\nhim. He murdered them to rob them and he did rob them. He took money and\nvarious things.... He told all this, word for word, to Sofya Semyonovna,\nthe only person who knows his secret. But she has had no share by word\nor deed in the murder; she was as horrified at it as you are now. Don’t\nbe anxious, she won’t betray him.”\n\n“It cannot be,” muttered Dounia, with white lips. She gasped for breath.\n“It cannot be. There was not the slightest cause, no sort of ground....\nIt’s a lie, a lie!”\n\n“He robbed her, that was the cause, he took money and things. It’s true\nthat by his own admission he made no use of the money or things, but hid\nthem under a stone, where they are now. But that was because he dared\nnot make use of them.”\n\n“But how could he steal, rob? How could he dream of it?” cried Dounia,\nand she jumped up from the chair. “Why, you know him, and you’ve seen\nhim, can he be a thief?”\n\nShe seemed to be imploring Svidrigaïlov; she had entirely forgotten her\nfear.\n\n“There are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities,\nAvdotya Romanovna. A thief steals and knows he is a scoundrel, but I’ve\nheard of a gentleman who broke open the mail. Who knows, very likely he\nthought he was doing a gentlemanly thing! Of course I should not have\nbelieved it myself if I’d been told of it as you have, but I believe my\nown ears. He explained all the causes of it to Sofya Semyonovna too, but\nshe did not believe her ears at first, yet she believed her own eyes at\nlast.”\n\n“What... were the causes?”\n\n“It’s a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Here’s... how shall I tell\nyou?--A theory of a sort, the same one by which I for instance consider\nthat a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right, a\nsolitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds! It’s galling too, of\ncourse, for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if\nhe had, for instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his\nwhole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three\nthousand. Add to that, nervous irritability from hunger, from lodging\nin a hole, from rags, from a vivid sense of the charm of his social\nposition and his sister’s and mother’s position too. Above all, vanity,\npride and vanity, though goodness knows he may have good qualities\ntoo.... I am not blaming him, please don’t think it; besides, it’s not\nmy business. A special little theory came in too--a theory of a\nsort--dividing mankind, you see, into material and superior persons,\nthat is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their\nsuperiority, who make laws for the rest of mankind, the material, that\nis. It’s all right as a theory, _une théorie comme une autre_. Napoleon\nattracted him tremendously, that is, what affected him was that a\ngreat many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but have\noverstepped the law without thinking about it. He seems to have fancied\nthat he was a genius too--that is, he was convinced of it for a time. He\nhas suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he\ncould make a theory, but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law,\nand so he is not a man of genius. And that’s humiliating for a young man\nof any pride, in our day especially....”\n\n“But remorse? You deny him any moral feeling then? Is he like that?”\n\n“Ah, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; not that it was\never in very good order. Russians in general are broad in their ideas,\nAvdotya Romanovna, broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to\nthe fantastic, the chaotic. But it’s a misfortune to be broad without\na special genius. Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on\nthis subject, sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper? Why,\nyou used to reproach me with breadth! Who knows, perhaps we were talking\nat the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan. There\nare no sacred traditions amongst us, especially in the educated class,\nAvdotya Romanovna. At the best someone will make them up somehow for\nhimself out of books or from some old chronicle. But those are for the\nmost part the learned and all old fogeys, so that it would be almost\nill-bred in a man of society. You know my opinions in general, though. I\nnever blame anyone. I do nothing at all, I persevere in that. But\nwe’ve talked of this more than once before. I was so happy indeed as to\ninterest you in my opinions.... You are very pale, Avdotya Romanovna.”\n\n“I know his theory. I read that article of his about men to whom all is\npermitted. Razumihin brought it to me.”\n\n“Mr. Razumihin? Your brother’s article? In a magazine? Is there such an\narticle? I didn’t know. It must be interesting. But where are you going,\nAvdotya Romanovna?”\n\n“I want to see Sofya Semyonovna,” Dounia articulated faintly. “How do I\ngo to her? She has come in, perhaps. I must see her at once. Perhaps\nshe...”\n\nAvdotya Romanovna could not finish. Her breath literally failed her.\n\n“Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night, at least I believe not.\nShe was to have been back at once, but if not, then she will not be in\ntill quite late.”\n\n“Ah, then you are lying! I see... you were lying... lying all the\ntime.... I don’t believe you! I don’t believe you!” cried Dounia,\ncompletely losing her head.\n\nAlmost fainting, she sank on to a chair which Svidrigaïlov made haste to\ngive her.\n\n“Avdotya Romanovna, what is it? Control yourself! Here is some water.\nDrink a little....”\n\nHe sprinkled some water over her. Dounia shuddered and came to herself.\n\n“It has acted violently,” Svidrigaïlov muttered to himself, frowning.\n“Avdotya Romanovna, calm yourself! Believe me, he has friends. We will\nsave him. Would you like me to take him abroad? I have money, I can get\na ticket in three days. And as for the murder, he will do all sorts of\ngood deeds yet, to atone for it. Calm yourself. He may become a great\nman yet. Well, how are you? How do you feel?”\n\n“Cruel man! To be able to jeer at it! Let me go...”\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“To him. Where is he? Do you know? Why is this door locked? We came in\nat that door and now it is locked. When did you manage to lock it?”\n\n“We couldn’t be shouting all over the flat on such a subject. I am far\nfrom jeering; it’s simply that I’m sick of talking like this. But how\ncan you go in such a state? Do you want to betray him? You will drive\nhim to fury, and he will give himself up. Let me tell you, he is already\nbeing watched; they are already on his track. You will simply be giving\nhim away. Wait a little: I saw him and was talking to him just now. He\ncan still be saved. Wait a bit, sit down; let us think it over together.\nI asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to\nconsider it thoroughly. But do sit down!”\n\n“How can you save him? Can he really be saved?”\n\nDounia sat down. Svidrigaïlov sat down beside her.\n\n“It all depends on you, on you, on you alone,” he began with glowing\neyes, almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for\nemotion.\n\nDounia drew back from him in alarm. He too was trembling all over.\n\n“You... one word from you, and he is saved. I... I’ll save him. I have\nmoney and friends. I’ll send him away at once. I’ll get a passport,\ntwo passports, one for him and one for me. I have friends... capable\npeople.... If you like, I’ll take a passport for you... for your\nmother.... What do you want with Razumihin? I love you too.... I love\nyou beyond everything.... Let me kiss the hem of your dress, let me, let\nme.... The very rustle of it is too much for me. Tell me, ‘do that,’\nand I’ll do it. I’ll do everything. I will do the impossible. What you\nbelieve, I will believe. I’ll do anything--anything! Don’t, don’t look\nat me like that. Do you know that you are killing me?...”\n\nHe was almost beginning to rave.... Something seemed suddenly to go to\nhis head. Dounia jumped up and rushed to the door.\n\n“Open it! Open it!” she called, shaking the door. “Open it! Is there no\none there?”\n\nSvidrigaïlov got up and came to himself. His still trembling lips slowly\nbroke into an angry mocking smile.\n\n“There is no one at home,” he said quietly and emphatically. “The\nlandlady has gone out, and it’s waste of time to shout like that. You\nare only exciting yourself uselessly.”\n\n“Where is the key? Open the door at once, at once, base man!”\n\n“I have lost the key and cannot find it.”\n\n“This is an outrage,” cried Dounia, turning pale as death. She rushed\nto the furthest corner, where she made haste to barricade herself with a\nlittle table.\n\nShe did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched\nevery movement he made.\n\nSvidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her.\nHe was positively composed, at least in appearance, but his face was\npale as before. The mocking smile did not leave his face.\n\n“You spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna. In that case you\nmay be sure I’ve taken measures. Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. The\nKapernaumovs are far away--there are five locked rooms between. I am at\nleast twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides.\nFor you could not complain afterwards. You surely would not be willing\nactually to betray your brother? Besides, no one would believe you. How\nshould a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings?\nSo that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing.\nIt is very difficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna.”\n\n“Scoundrel!” whispered Dounia indignantly.\n\n“As you like, but observe I was only speaking by way of a general\nproposition. It’s my personal conviction that you are perfectly\nright--violence is hateful. I only spoke to show you that you need have\nno remorse even if... you were willing to save your brother of your\nown accord, as I suggest to you. You would be simply submitting to\ncircumstances, to violence, in fact, if we must use that word. Think\nabout it. Your brother’s and your mother’s fate are in your hands. I\nwill be your slave... all my life... I will wait here.”\n\nSvidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia. She had\nnot the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination. Besides, she\nknew him. Suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked it\nand laid it in her hand on the table. Svidrigaïlov jumped up.\n\n“Aha! So that’s it, is it?” he cried, surprised but smiling maliciously.\n“Well, that completely alters the aspect of affairs. You’ve made things\nwonderfully easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna. But where did you get the\nrevolver? Was it Mr. Razumihin? Why, it’s my revolver, an old friend!\nAnd how I’ve hunted for it! The shooting lessons I’ve given you in the\ncountry have not been thrown away.”\n\n“It’s not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed,\nwretch! There was nothing of yours in her house. I took it when I began\nto suspect what you were capable of. If you dare to advance one step, I\nswear I’ll kill you.” She was frantic.\n\n“But your brother? I ask from curiosity,” said Svidrigaïlov, still\nstanding where he was.\n\n“Inform, if you want to! Don’t stir! Don’t come nearer! I’ll shoot! You\npoisoned your wife, I know; you are a murderer yourself!” She held the\nrevolver ready.\n\n“Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?”\n\n“You did! You hinted it yourself; you talked to me of poison.... I know\nyou went to get it... you had it in readiness.... It was your doing....\nIt must have been your doing.... Scoundrel!”\n\n“Even if that were true, it would have been for your sake... you would\nhave been the cause.”\n\n“You are lying! I hated you always, always....”\n\n“Oho, Avdotya Romanovna! You seem to have forgotten how you softened\nto me in the heat of propaganda. I saw it in your eyes. Do you remember\nthat moonlight night, when the nightingale was singing?”\n\n“That’s a lie,” there was a flash of fury in Dounia’s eyes, “that’s a\nlie and a libel!”\n\n“A lie? Well, if you like, it’s a lie. I made it up. Women ought not\nto be reminded of such things,” he smiled. “I know you will shoot, you\npretty wild creature. Well, shoot away!”\n\nDounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him, measuring the\ndistance and awaiting the first movement on his part. Her lower lip was\nwhite and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire. He had\nnever seen her so handsome. The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment\nshe raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of\nanguish in his heart. He took a step forward and a shot rang out. The\nbullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind. He stood still and\nlaughed softly.\n\n“The wasp has stung me. She aimed straight at my head. What’s this?\nBlood?” he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowed\nin a thin stream down his right temple. The bullet seemed to have just\ngrazed the skin.\n\nDounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov not so much in\nterror as in a sort of wild amazement. She seemed not to understand what\nshe was doing and what was going on.\n\n“Well, you missed! Fire again, I’ll wait,” said Svidrigaïlov softly,\nstill smiling, but gloomily. “If you go on like that, I shall have time\nto seize you before you cock again.”\n\nDounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it.\n\n“Let me be,” she cried in despair. “I swear I’ll shoot again. I... I’ll\nkill you.”\n\n“Well... at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you don’t...\nthen.” His eyes flashed and he took two steps forward. Dounia shot\nagain: it missed fire.\n\n“You haven’t loaded it properly. Never mind, you have another charge\nthere. Get it ready, I’ll wait.”\n\nHe stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild\ndetermination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes. Dounia\nsaw that he would sooner die than let her go. “And... now, of course she\nwould kill him, at two paces!” Suddenly she flung away the revolver.\n\n“She’s dropped it!” said Svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he drew a deep\nbreath. A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart--perhaps not only\nthe fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment.\nIt was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter,\nwhich he could not himself have defined.\n\nHe went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist. She did not\nresist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes.\nHe tried to say something, but his lips moved without being able to\nutter a sound.\n\n“Let me go,” Dounia implored. Svidrigaïlov shuddered. Her voice now was\nquite different.\n\n“Then you don’t love me?” he asked softly. Dounia shook her head.\n\n“And... and you can’t? Never?” he whispered in despair.\n\n“Never!”\n\nThere followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of\nSvidrigaïlov. He looked at her with an indescribable gaze. Suddenly\nhe withdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.\nAnother moment passed.\n\n“Here’s the key.”\n\nHe took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table\nbehind him, without turning or looking at Dounia.\n\n“Take it! Make haste!”\n\nHe looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went up to the table to\ntake the key.\n\n“Make haste! Make haste!” repeated Svidrigaïlov, still without turning\nor moving. But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that\n“make haste.”\n\nDounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it\nquickly and rushed out of the room. A minute later, beside herself, she\nran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge.\n\nSvidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the window. At last he\nslowly turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead. A\nstrange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of\ndespair. The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand.\nHe looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his temple.\nThe revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly\ncaught his eye. He picked it up and examined it. It was a little pocket\nthree-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction. There were still\ntwo charges and one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. He\nthought a little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and went\nout.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nHe spent that evening till ten o’clock going from one low haunt to\nanother. Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain\n\n“villain and tyrant,”\n\n“began kissing Katia.”\n\nSvidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and\nthe waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to these\nclerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the\nleft and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasure\ngarden, where he paid for their entrance. There was one lanky\nthree-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a\n“Vauxhall,” which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was\nserved, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.\nA chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed\nGerman clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. The\nclerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent.\nSvidrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them for\na quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no\npossibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain was\nthat one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in\nselling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his\ncompanion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon\nbelonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem\ntroublesome. Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of\nthe garden. It was about six o’clock. He had not drunk a drop of wine\nall this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than\nanything.\n\nIt was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over\nthe sky about ten o’clock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rain\ncame down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on the\nearth in streams. There were flashes of lightning every minute and each\nflash lasted while one could count five.\n\nDrenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the\nbureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then,\nputting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes,\nbut, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the\nrain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room\nwithout locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at home.\n\nShe was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. She\nwas giving them tea. She received Svidrigaïlov in respectful silence,\nlooking wonderingly at his soaking clothes. The children all ran away at\nonce in indescribable terror.\n\nSvidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him.\nShe timidly prepared to listen.\n\n“I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,” said Svidrigaïlov, “and\nas I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some\narrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to\nyou, you need not tell me.” (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) “Those\npeople have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your\nbrother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them\nI’ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You had\nbetter take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take\nthem! Well now, that’s settled. Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the\nvalue of three thousand roubles. Take those for yourself, entirely for\nyourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one\nknows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, for to go on\nliving in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no\nneed for it now.”\n\n“I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my\nstepmother,” said Sonia hurriedly, “and if I’ve said so little... please\ndon’t consider...”\n\n“That’s enough! that’s enough!”\n\n“But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grateful to you,\nbut I don’t need it now. I can always earn my own living. Don’t think me\nungrateful. If you are so charitable, that money....”\n\n“It’s for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don’t waste words\nover it. I haven’t time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovitch\nhas two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia.” (Sonia looked\nwildly at him, and started.) “Don’t be uneasy, I know all about it from\nhimself and I am not a gossip; I won’t tell anyone. It was good advice\nwhen you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much\nbetter for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and\nyou will follow him. That’s so, isn’t it? And if so, you’ll need money.\nYou’ll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the same\nas my giving it to him. Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay\nwhat’s owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so\nheedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna’s debt and not\nyours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.\nYou can’t get through the world like that. If you are ever questioned\nabout me--to-morrow or the day after you will be asked--don’t say\nanything about my coming to see you now and don’t show the money to\nanyone or say a word about it. Well, now good-bye.” (He got up.) “My\ngreetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way, you’d better put the money\nfor the present in Mr. Razumihin’s keeping. You know Mr. Razumihin? Of\ncourse you do. He’s not a bad fellow. Take it to him to-morrow or...\nwhen the time comes. And till then, hide it carefully.”\n\nSonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at Svidrigaïlov.\nShe longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments she\ndid not dare and did not know how to begin.\n\n“How can you... how can you be going now, in such rain?”\n\n“Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain! Ha, ha! Good-bye,\nSofya Semyonovna, my dear! Live and live long, you will be of use to\nothers. By the way... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him.\nTell him Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov sends his greetings. Be sure\nto.”\n\nHe went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague\napprehension.\n\nIt appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven,\nhe made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still\npersisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where\nthe parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky\nIsland. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit\nat first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigaïlov could be\nvery fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very\nintelligent surmise of the sensible parents that Svidrigaïlov had\nprobably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing\nvanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see\nSvidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the\nconversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a direct\nquestion, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she\nwere obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when Svidrigaïlov\nwould like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested and\nalmost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only\nby degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On other\noccasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady\nIvanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his\nbetrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she\nhad already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.\n\nSvidrigaïlov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important\naffairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her\nfifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from\nhim, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present\nbefore their wedding. The logical connection of the present with his\nimmediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that\npurpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all went\noff very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret,\nthe inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the\nother hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced\nby tears from the most sensible of mothers. Svidrigaïlov got up,\nlaughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon\ncome back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a\nsort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though\nhe felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be\nimmediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. He\nwent away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but\nthe tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of\nthe most important of their doubts, concluding that Svidrigaïlov was\na great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great\nwealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would start\noff on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that\nthere was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he\nwas wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric,\nand all these people of high society didn’t think of what was said of\nthem and didn’t stand on ceremony. Possibly, indeed, he came like that\non purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a\nword should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and\nthe money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the\ncook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be said\nto that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat up\nwhispering till two o’clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier,\namazed and rather sorrowful.\n\nSvidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the\nway back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring\nwind. He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black\nwaters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.\nBut he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and\nwent towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a long\ntime, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the\nwooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side\nof the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately that\nthere was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly\nlarge, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He was\nnot mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place\nthat he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long,\nblackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were\nlights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked\na ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter,\nscanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a\nclose and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under\nthe stairs. There was no other, all were occupied. The ragged fellow\nlooked inquiringly.\n\n“Is there tea?” asked Svidrigaïlov.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“What else is there?”\n\n“Veal, vodka, savouries.”\n\n“Bring me tea and veal.”\n\n“And you want nothing else?” he asked with apparent surprise.\n\n“Nothing, nothing.”\n\nThe ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.\n\n“It must be a nice place,” thought Svidrigaïlov. “How was it I didn’t\nknow it? I expect I look as if I came from a café chantant and have\nhad some adventure on the way. It would be interesting to know who stayed\nhere?”\n\nHe lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a\nroom so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it;\nit had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained\nchair and table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though they\nwere made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty\nthat the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general\ncolour--yellow--could still be made out. One of the walls was cut short\nby the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under\nthe stairs.\n\nSvidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into\nthought. But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout\nin the next room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from\nthe moment he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding and\nalmost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.\n\nSvidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw\nlight through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. The\nroom, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants. One of\nthem, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing\nin the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to\npreserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast. He reproached\nthe other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. He\ndeclared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn\nhim out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it\nall. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the\nair of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but can’t. He sometimes\nturned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not\nthe slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it. A\ncandle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly\nempty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs\nof stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, Svidrigaïlov turned away\nindifferently and sat down on the bed.\n\nThe ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking\nhim again whether he didn’t want anything more, and again receiving a\nnegative reply, finally withdrew. Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a\nglass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything. He began\nto feel feverish. He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the\nblanket, lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. “It would have been better\nto be well for the occasion,” he thought with a smile. The room was\nclose, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard\na mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of\nleather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. He\nfelt a longing to fix his imagination on something. “It must be a garden\nunder the window,” he thought. “There’s a sound of trees. How I dislike\nthe sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! They give one a\nhorrid feeling.” He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed\nPetrovsky Park just now. This reminded him of the bridge over the Little\nNeva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. “I never have\nliked water,” he thought, “even in a landscape,” and he suddenly smiled\nagain at a strange idea: “Surely now all these questions of taste and\ncomfort ought not to matter, but I’ve become more particular, like an\nanimal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. I ought\nto have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold,\nha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!... By the way, why\nhaven’t I put out the candle?” he blew it out. “They’ve gone to bed next\ndoor,” he thought, not seeing the light at the crack. “Well, now, Marfa\nPetrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it’s dark, and the very\ntime and place for you. But now you won’t come!”\n\nHe suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on\nDounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin’s\nkeeping. “I suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to\ntease myself. But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! He’s gone through a\ngood deal. He may be a successful rogue in time when he’s got over\nhis nonsense. But now he’s _too_ eager for life. These young men\nare contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let him please\nhimself, it’s nothing to do with me.”\n\nHe could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia’s image rose before him,\nand a shudder ran over him. “No, I must give up all that now,” he\nthought, rousing himself. “I must think of something else. It’s queer\nand funny. I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly\ndesired to avenge myself even, and that’s a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad\nsign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper--that’s\na bad sign too. And the promises I made her just now, too--Damnation!\nBut--who knows?--perhaps she would have made a new man of me\nsomehow....”\n\nHe ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again Dounia’s image\nrose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time,\nshe had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that\nhe might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand\nto defend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at that\ninstant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his\nheart...\n\n“Aïe! Damnation, these thoughts again! I must put it away!”\n\nHe was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly\nsomething seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes. He\nstarted. “Ugh! hang it! I believe it’s a mouse,” he thought, “that’s the\nveal I left on the table.” He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the\nblanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over\nhis leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. Shaking\nwith feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.\nHe shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.\nHe tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without\nleaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and\nsuddenly darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in one\ninstant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down\nhis back under his shirt. He trembled nervously and woke up.\n\nThe room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket\nas before. The wind was howling under the window. “How disgusting,” he\nthought with annoyance.\n\nHe got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the\nwindow. “It’s better not to sleep at all,” he decided. There was a cold\ndamp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the\nblanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of\nanything and did not want to think. But one image rose after another,\nincoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his\nmind. He sank into drowsiness. Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or\nthe dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees\nroused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling\non images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright,\nwarm, almost hot day, a holiday--Trinity day. A fine, sumptuous country\ncottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with\nflower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was\nsurrounded with beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with\nrich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He noticed\nparticularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant\nnarcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks. He was\nreluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and came\ninto a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows,\nthe doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers.\nThe floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows\nwere open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room. The birds were\nchirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table\ncovered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin was\ncovered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of\nflowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers lay a girl in a\nwhite muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as\nthough carved out of marble. But her loose fair hair was wet; there was\na wreath of roses on her head. The stern and already rigid profile of\nher face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her\npale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.\nSvidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle\nbeside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.\nShe was only fourteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed\nherself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish\nsoul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn\nfrom her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on\na dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....\n\nSvidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the\nwindow. He felt for the latch and opened it. The wind lashed furiously\ninto the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered with\nhis shirt, as though with frost. Under the window there must have been\nsomething like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too,\nprobably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now drops of\nrain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as\nin a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of\nobjects. Svidrigaïlov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill,\ngazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed\nby a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night. “Ah, the\nsignal! The river is overflowing,” he thought. “By morning it will be\nswirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and\ncellars. The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain\nand wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys. What time is\nit now?” And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on\nthe wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.\n\n“Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I’ll go out at once\nstraight to the park. I’ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain,\nso that as soon as one’s shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on\none’s head.”\n\nHe moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his\nwaistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle,\ninto the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep\nsomewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay\nhim for the room and leave the hotel. “It’s the best minute; I couldn’t\nchoose a better.”\n\nHe walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding\nanyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner\nbetween an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object\nwhich seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little\ngirl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her\nclothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem afraid of\nSvidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big\nblack eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been\ncrying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted. The child’s face\nwas pale and tired, she was numb with cold. “How can she have come here?\nShe must have hidden here and not slept all night.” He began questioning\nher. The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby\nlanguage, something about “mammy” and that “mammy would beat her,” and\nabout some cup that she had “bwoken.” The child chattered on without\nstopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was a\nneglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service\nof the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken\na cup of her mother’s and was so frightened that she had run away the\nevening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the\nrain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and\nspent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness\nand the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his\narms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing\nher. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as\nwet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night. When he had\nundressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in\nthe blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he\nsank into dreary musing again.\n\n“What folly to trouble myself,” he decided suddenly with an oppressive\nfeeling of annoyance. “What idiocy!” In vexation he took up the candle\nto go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.\n“Damn the child!” he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again\nto see whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket carefully.\nThe child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket,\nand her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange to say that flush seemed\nbrighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. “It’s a flush\nof fever,” thought Svidrigaïlov. It was like the flush from drinking, as\nthough she had been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were\nhot and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that her long\nblack eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a\nsly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little\ngirl were not asleep, but pretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in\na smile. The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to\ncontrol them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin,\na broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite\nunchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the\nshameless face of a French harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they\nturned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited\nhim.... There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that\nlaugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child. “What,\nat five years old?” Svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror. “What does\nit mean?” And now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holding\nout her arms.... “Accursed child!” Svidrigaïlov cried, raising his hand\nto strike her, but at that moment he woke up.\n\nHe was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The candle had not\nbeen lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows.\n\n“I’ve had nightmare all night!” He got up angrily, feeling utterly\nshattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he could\nsee nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept himself! He got up,\nput on his still damp jacket and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his\npocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his\npocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few\nlines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into thought with his\nelbows on the table. The revolver and the notebook lay beside him. Some\nflies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on\nthe table. He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began\ntrying to catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it.\nAt last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he\nstarted, got up and walked resolutely out of the room. A minute later he\nwas in the street.\n\nA thick milky mist hung over the town. Svidrigaïlov walked along the\nslippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He was picturing\nthe waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island,\nthe wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the\nbush.... He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think\nof something else. There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.\nThe bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with\ntheir closed shutters. The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and\nhe began to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs and read\neach carefully. At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and\ncame to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with\nits tail between its legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead\ndrunk, across the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high tower\nstood up on the left. “Bah!” he shouted, “here is a place. Why should\nit be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an official witness\nanyway....”\n\nHe almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where\nthere was the big house with the tower. At the great closed gates of\nthe house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them,\nwrapped in a grey soldier’s coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his\nhead. He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov. His\nface wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly\nprinted on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both,\nSvidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes\nwithout speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man\nnot drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a\nword.\n\n“What do you want here?” he said, without moving or changing his\nposition.\n\n“Nothing, brother, good morning,” answered Svidrigaïlov.\n\n“This isn’t the place.”\n\n“I am going to foreign parts, brother.”\n\n“To foreign parts?”\n\n“To America.”\n\n“America.”\n\nSvidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it. Achilles raised his\neyebrows.\n\n“I say, this is not the place for such jokes!”\n\n“Why shouldn’t it be the place?”\n\n“Because it isn’t.”\n\n“Well, brother, I don’t mind that. It’s a good place. When you are\nasked, you just say he was going, he said, to America.”\n\nHe put the revolver to his right temple.\n\n“You can’t do it here, it’s not the place,” cried Achilles, rousing\nhimself, his eyes growing bigger and bigger.\n\nSvidrigaïlov pulled the trigger.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe same day, about seven o’clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on\nhis way to his mother’s and sister’s lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyev’s\nhouse which Razumihin had found for them. The stairs went up from\nthe street. Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still\nhesitating whether to go or not. But nothing would have turned him back:\nhis decision was taken.\n\n“Besides, it doesn’t matter, they still know nothing,” he thought, “and\nthey are used to thinking of me as eccentric.”\n\nHe was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, soaked with a\nnight’s rain. His face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the\ninward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours. He had spent all\nthe previous night alone, God knows where. But anyway he had reached a\ndecision.\n\nHe knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. Dounia was not\nat home. Even the servant happened to be out. At first Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by\nthe hand and drew him into the room.\n\n“Here you are!” she began, faltering with joy. “Don’t be angry with\nme, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing not\ncrying. Did you think I was crying? No, I am delighted, but I’ve got\ninto such a stupid habit of shedding tears. I’ve been like that ever\nsince your father’s death. I cry for anything. Sit down, dear boy, you\nmust be tired; I see you are. Ah, how muddy you are.”\n\n“I was in the rain yesterday, mother....” Raskolnikov began.\n\n“No, no,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted, “you thought I\nwas going to cross-question you in the womanish way I used to; don’t be\nanxious, I understand, I understand it all: now I’ve learned the ways\nhere and truly I see for myself that they are better. I’ve made up my\nmind once for all: how could I understand your plans and expect you to\ngive an account of them? God knows what concerns and plans you may have,\nor what ideas you are hatching; so it’s not for me to keep nudging your\nelbow, asking you what you are thinking about? But, my goodness! why\nam I running to and fro as though I were crazy...? I am reading your\narticle in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. Dmitri Prokofitch\nbrought it to me. Directly I saw it I cried out to myself: ‘There,\nfoolish one,’ I thought, ‘that’s what he is busy about; that’s the\nsolution of the mystery! Learned people are always like that. He may\nhave some new ideas in his head just now; he is thinking them over and I\nworry him and upset him.’ I read it, my dear, and of course there was a\ngreat deal I did not understand; but that’s only natural--how should I?”\n\n“Show me, mother.”\n\nRaskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article. Incongruous\nas it was with his mood and his circumstances, he felt that strange and\nbitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he\nsees himself in print; besides, he was only twenty-three. It lasted only\na moment. After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed\nwith anguish. He recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding\nmonths. He flung the article on the table with disgust and anger.\n\n“But, however foolish I may be, Rodya, I can see for myself that you\nwill very soon be one of the leading--if not the leading man--in the\nworld of Russian thought. And they dared to think you were mad! You\ndon’t know, but they really thought that. Ah, the despicable creatures,\nhow could they understand genius! And Dounia, Dounia was all but\nbelieving it--what do you say to that? Your father sent twice to\nmagazines--the first time poems (I’ve got the manuscript and will show\nyou) and the second time a whole novel (I begged him to let me copy it\nout) and how we prayed that they should be taken--they weren’t! I was\nbreaking my heart, Rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and your\nclothes and the way you are living. But now I see again how foolish\nI was, for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and\ntalent. No doubt you don’t care about that for the present and you are\noccupied with much more important matters....”\n\n“Dounia’s not at home, mother?”\n\n“No, Rodya. I often don’t see her; she leaves me alone. Dmitri\nProkofitch comes to see me, it’s so good of him, and he always talks\nabout you. He loves you and respects you, my dear. I don’t say that\nDounia is very wanting in consideration. I am not complaining. She has\nher ways and I have mine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and\nI never have any secrets from you two. Of course, I am sure that Dounia\nhas far too much sense, and besides she loves you and me... but I don’t\nknow what it will all lead to. You’ve made me so happy by coming now,\nRodya, but she has missed you by going out; when she comes in I’ll tell\nher: ‘Your brother came in while you were out. Where have you been all\nthis time?’ You mustn’t spoil me, Rodya, you know; come when you can,\nbut if you can’t, it doesn’t matter, I can wait. I shall know, anyway,\nthat you are fond of me, that will be enough for me. I shall read what\nyou write, I shall hear about you from everyone, and sometimes you’ll\ncome yourself to see me. What could be better? Here you’ve come now to\ncomfort your mother, I see that.”\n\nHere Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.\n\n“Here I am again! Don’t mind my foolishness. My goodness, why am I\nsitting here?” she cried, jumping up. “There is coffee and I don’t offer\nyou any. Ah, that’s the selfishness of old age. I’ll get it at once!”\n\n“Mother, don’t trouble, I am going at once. I haven’t come for that.\nPlease listen to me.”\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly.\n\n“Mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever you are\ntold about me, will you always love me as you do now?” he asked suddenly\nfrom the fullness of his heart, as though not thinking of his words and\nnot weighing them.\n\n“Rodya, Rodya, what is the matter? How can you ask me such a question?\nWhy, who will tell me anything about you? Besides, I shouldn’t believe\nanyone, I should refuse to listen.”\n\n“I’ve come to assure you that I’ve always loved you and I am glad\nthat we are alone, even glad Dounia is out,” he went on with the same\nimpulse. “I have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy, you\nmust believe that your son loves you now more than himself, and that all\nyou thought about me, that I was cruel and didn’t care about you, was\nall a mistake. I shall never cease to love you.... Well, that’s enough:\nI thought I must do this and begin with this....”\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence, pressing him to her\nbosom and weeping gently.\n\n“I don’t know what is wrong with you, Rodya,” she said at last. “I’ve\nbeen thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I see\nthat there is a great sorrow in store for you, and that’s why you are\nmiserable. I’ve foreseen it a long time, Rodya. Forgive me for speaking\nabout it. I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights. Your sister\nlay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but you. I\ncaught something, but I couldn’t make it out. I felt all the morning\nas though I were going to be hanged, waiting for something, expecting\nsomething, and now it has come! Rodya, Rodya, where are you going? You\nare going away somewhere?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“That’s what I thought! I can come with you, you know, if you need\nme. And Dounia, too; she loves you, she loves you dearly--and Sofya\nSemyonovna may come with us if you like. You see, I am glad to look upon\nher as a daughter even... Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together.\nBut... where... are you going?”\n\n“Good-bye, mother.”\n\n“What, to-day?” she cried, as though losing him for ever.\n\n“I can’t stay, I must go now....”\n\n“And can’t I come with you?”\n\n“No, but kneel down and pray to God for me. Your prayer perhaps will\nreach Him.”\n\n“Let me bless you and sign you with the cross. That’s right, that’s\nright. Oh, God, what are we doing?”\n\nYes, he was glad, he was very glad that there was no one there, that\nhe was alone with his mother. For the first time after all those awful\nmonths his heart was softened. He fell down before her, he kissed her\nfeet and both wept, embracing. And she was not surprised and did not\nquestion him this time. For some days she had realised that something\nawful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had\ncome for him.\n\n“Rodya, my darling, my first born,” she said sobbing, “now you are just\nas when you were little. You would run like this to me and hug me and\nkiss me. When your father was living and we were poor, you comforted us\nsimply by being with us and when I buried your father, how often we\nwept together at his grave and embraced, as now. And if I’ve been crying\nlately, it’s that my mother’s heart had a foreboding of trouble. The\nfirst time I saw you, that evening, you remember, as soon as we arrived\nhere, I guessed simply from your eyes. My heart sank at once, and to-day\nwhen I opened the door and looked at you, I thought the fatal hour had\ncome. Rodya, Rodya, you are not going away to-day?”\n\n“No!”\n\n“You’ll come again?”\n\n“Yes... I’ll come.”\n\n“Rodya, don’t be angry, I don’t dare to question you. I know I mustn’t.\nOnly say two words to me--is it far where you are going?”\n\n“Very far.”\n\n“What is awaiting you there? Some post or career for you?”\n\n“What God sends... only pray for me.” Raskolnikov went to the door, but\nshe clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes. Her face worked\nwith terror.\n\n“Enough, mother,” said Raskolnikov, deeply regretting that he had come.\n\n“Not for ever, it’s not yet for ever? You’ll come, you’ll come\nto-morrow?”\n\n“I will, I will, good-bye.” He tore himself away at last.\n\nIt was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning.\nRaskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made haste. He wanted to finish all\nbefore sunset. He did not want to meet anyone till then. Going up the\nstairs he noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him\nintently. “Can anyone have come to see me?” he wondered. He had a\ndisgusted vision of Porfiry. But opening his door he saw Dounia. She\nwas sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, and looked as though she had\nbeen waiting a long time. He stopped short in the doorway. She rose from\nthe sofa in dismay and stood up facing him. Her eyes, fixed upon him,\nbetrayed horror and infinite grief. And from those eyes alone he saw at\nonce that she knew.\n\n“Am I to come in or go away?” he asked uncertainly.\n\n“I’ve been all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both waiting for you.\nWe thought that you would be sure to come there.”\n\nRaskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair.\n\n“I feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have liked at this\nmoment to be able to control myself.”\n\nHe glanced at her mistrustfully.\n\n“Where were you all night?”\n\n“I don’t remember clearly. You see, sister, I wanted to make up my mind\nonce for all, and several times I walked by the Neva, I remember that\nI wanted to end it all there, but... I couldn’t make up my mind,” he\nwhispered, looking at her mistrustfully again.\n\n“Thank God! That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya Semyonovna and\nI. Then you still have faith in life? Thank God, thank God!”\n\nRaskolnikov smiled bitterly.\n\n“I haven’t faith, but I have just been weeping in mother’s arms; I\nhaven’t faith, but I have just asked her to pray for me. I don’t know\nhow it is, Dounia, I don’t understand it.”\n\n“Have you been at mother’s? Have you told her?” cried Dounia,\nhorror-stricken. “Surely you haven’t done that?”\n\n“No, I didn’t tell her... in words; but she understood a great deal.\nShe heard you talking in your sleep. I am sure she half understands it\nalready. Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her. I don’t know why I did\ngo. I am a contemptible person, Dounia.”\n\n“A contemptible person, but ready to face suffering! You are, aren’t\nyou?”\n\n“Yes, I am going. At once. Yes, to escape the disgrace I thought of\ndrowning myself, Dounia, but as I looked into the water, I thought that\nif I had considered myself strong till now I’d better not be afraid of\ndisgrace,” he said, hurrying on. “It’s pride, Dounia.”\n\n“Pride, Rodya.”\n\nThere was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be glad\nto think that he was still proud.\n\n“You don’t think, sister, that I was simply afraid of the water?” he\nasked, looking into her face with a sinister smile.\n\n“Oh, Rodya, hush!” cried Dounia bitterly. Silence lasted for two\nminutes. He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; Dounia stood at the\nother end of the table and looked at him with anguish. Suddenly he got\nup.\n\n“It’s late, it’s time to go! I am going at once to give myself up. But I\ndon’t know why I am going to give myself up.”\n\nBig tears fell down her cheeks.\n\n“You are crying, sister, but can you hold out your hand to me?”\n\n“You doubted it?”\n\nShe threw her arms round him.\n\n“Aren’t you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering?” she\ncried, holding him close and kissing him.\n\n“Crime? What crime?” he cried in sudden fury. “That I killed a vile\nnoxious insect, an old pawnbroker woman, of use to no one!... Killing\nher was atonement for forty sins. She was sucking the life out of poor\npeople. Was that a crime? I am not thinking of it and I am not thinking\nof expiating it, and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides? ‘A\ncrime! a crime!’ Only now I see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice,\nnow that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace. It’s simply\nbecause I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I have decided to,\nperhaps too for my advantage, as that... Porfiry... suggested!”\n\n“Brother, brother, what are you saying? Why, you have shed blood?” cried\nDounia in despair.\n\n“Which all men shed,” he put in almost frantically, “which flows and has\nalways flowed in streams, which is spilt like champagne, and for which\nmen are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of\nmankind. Look into it more carefully and understand it! I too wanted to\ndo good to men and would have done hundreds, thousands of good deeds\nto make up for that one piece of stupidity, not stupidity even, simply\nclumsiness, for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now\nthat it has failed.... (Everything seems stupid when it fails.) By that\nstupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position, to\ntake the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would have\nbeen smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison.... But I...\nI couldn’t carry out even the first step, because I am contemptible,\nthat’s what’s the matter! And yet I won’t look at it as you do. If I had\nsucceeded I should have been crowned with glory, but now I’m trapped.”\n\n“But that’s not so, not so! Brother, what are you saying?”\n\n“Ah, it’s not picturesque, not æsthetically attractive! I fail to\nunderstand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable.\nThe fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence. I’ve never,\nnever recognised this more clearly than now, and I am further than ever\nfrom seeing that what I did was a crime. I’ve never, never been stronger\nand more convinced than now.”\n\nThe colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face, but as he uttered\nhis last explanation, he happened to meet Dounia’s eyes and he saw such\nanguish in them that he could not help being checked. He felt that he\nhad, anyway, made these two poor women miserable, that he was, anyway,\nthe cause...\n\n“Dounia darling, if I am guilty forgive me (though I cannot be forgiven\nif I am guilty). Good-bye! We won’t dispute. It’s time, high time to go.\nDon’t follow me, I beseech you, I have somewhere else to go.... But you\ngo at once and sit with mother. I entreat you to! It’s my last request\nof you. Don’t leave her at all; I left her in a state of anxiety, that\nshe is not fit to bear; she will die or go out of her mind. Be with\nher! Razumihin will be with you. I’ve been talking to him.... Don’t cry\nabout me: I’ll try to be honest and manly all my life, even if I am a\nmurderer. Perhaps I shall some day make a name. I won’t disgrace you,\nyou will see; I’ll still show.... Now good-bye for the present,” he\nconcluded hurriedly, noticing again a strange expression in Dounia’s\neyes at his last words and promises. “Why are you crying? Don’t cry,\ndon’t cry: we are not parting for ever! Ah, yes! Wait a minute, I’d\nforgotten!”\n\nHe went to the table, took up a thick dusty book, opened it and took\nfrom between the pages a little water-colour portrait on ivory. It was\nthe portrait of his landlady’s daughter, who had died of fever, that\nstrange girl who had wanted to be a nun. For a minute he gazed at the\ndelicate expressive face of his betrothed, kissed the portrait and gave\nit to Dounia.\n\n“I used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to her,” he said\nthoughtfully. “To her heart I confided much of what has since been so\nhideously realised. Don’t be uneasy,” he returned to Dounia, “she was\nas much opposed to it as you, and I am glad that she is gone. The great\npoint is that everything now is going to be different, is going to\nbe broken in two,” he cried, suddenly returning to his dejection.\n“Everything, everything, and am I prepared for it? Do I want it myself?\nThey say it is necessary for me to suffer! What’s the object of these\nsenseless sufferings? shall I know any better what they are for, when I\nam crushed by hardships and idiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty\nyears’ penal servitude? And what shall I have to live for then? Why am I\nconsenting to that life now? Oh, I knew I was contemptible when I stood\nlooking at the Neva at daybreak to-day!”\n\nAt last they both went out. It was hard for Dounia, but she loved him.\nShe walked away, but after going fifty paces she turned round to look\nat him again. He was still in sight. At the corner he too turned and for\nthe last time their eyes met; but noticing that she was looking at him,\nhe motioned her away with impatience and even vexation, and turned the\ncorner abruptly.\n\n“I am wicked, I see that,” he thought to himself, feeling ashamed a\nmoment later of his angry gesture to Dounia. “But why are they so fond\nof me if I don’t deserve it? Oh, if only I were alone and no one loved\nme and I too had never loved anyone! _Nothing of all this would have\nhappened._ But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so\nmeek that I shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word\nthat I am a criminal? Yes, that’s it, that’s it, that’s what they are\nsending me there for, that’s what they want. Look at them running to and\nfro about the streets, every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at\nheart and, worse still, an idiot. But try to get me off and they’d be\nwild with righteous indignation. Oh, how I hate them all!”\n\nHe fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, that he could\nbe humbled before all of them, indiscriminately--humbled by conviction.\nAnd yet why not? It must be so. Would not twenty years of continual\nbondage crush him utterly? Water wears out a stone. And why, why should\nhe live after that? Why should he go now when he knew that it would be\nso? It was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that\nquestion since the previous evening, but still he went.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nWhen he went into Sonia’s room, it was already getting dark. All day\nSonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety. Dounia had been\nwaiting with her. She had come to her that morning, remembering\nSvidrigaïlov’s words that Sonia knew. We will not describe the\nconversation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they became.\nDounia gained one comfort at least from that interview, that her\nbrother would not be alone. He had gone to her, Sonia, first with his\nconfession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it;\nshe would go with him wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask,\nbut she knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with reverence and\nat first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was almost on the point\nof tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, hardly worthy to look at\nDounia. Dounia’s gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively\nand respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room had\nremained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.\n\nDounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to her\nbrother’s room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come\nthere first. When she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread\nof his committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it. But they had spent\nthe day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both\nwere less anxious while they were together. As soon as they parted, each\nthought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to\nher the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives--Siberia or...\nBesides she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith.\n\n“Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to\nmake him live?” she thought at last in despair.\n\nMeanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in dejection, looking\nintently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the\nunwhitewashed blank wall of the next house. At last when she began to\nfeel sure of his death--he walked into the room.\n\nShe gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned\npale.\n\n“Yes,” said Raskolnikov, smiling. “I have come for your cross, Sonia. It\nwas you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened\nnow it’s come to that?”\n\nSonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange to her; a cold\nshiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the\nwords were a mask. He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid\nmeeting her eyes.\n\n“You see, Sonia, I’ve decided that it will be better so. There is one\nfact.... But it’s a long story and there’s no need to discuss it. But\ndo you know what angers me? It annoys me that all those stupid brutish\nfaces will be gaping at me directly, pestering me with their stupid\nquestions, which I shall have to answer--they’ll point their fingers at\nme.... Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. I’d\nrather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise\nhim, what a sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; I’ve become\ntoo irritable of late. You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my\nsister just now, because she turned to take a last look at me. It’s\na brutal state to be in! Ah! what am I coming to! Well, where are the\ncrosses?”\n\nHe seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could not stay still or\nconcentrate his attention on anything; his ideas seemed to gallop after\none another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly.\n\nWithout a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress\nwood and one of copper. She made the sign of the cross over herself and\nover him, and put the wooden cross on his neck.\n\n“It’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,” he laughed. “As though I\nhad not suffered much till now! The wooden cross, that is the peasant\none; the copper one, that is Lizaveta’s--you will wear yourself, show\nme! So she had it on... at that moment? I remember two things like\nthese too, a silver one and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old\nwoman’s neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are what I\nought to put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what\nmatters; I’m somehow forgetful.... You see I have come to warn you,\nSonia, so that you might know... that’s all--that’s all I came for. But\nI thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I\nam going to prison and you’ll have your wish. Well, what are you crying\nfor? You too? Don’t. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!”\n\nBut his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her. “Why\nis she grieving too?” he thought to himself. “What am I to her? Why does\nshe weep? Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia? She’ll\nbe my nurse.”\n\n“Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,” Sonia begged in a timid\nbroken voice.\n\n“Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, sincerely....”\n\nBut he wanted to say something quite different.\n\nHe crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her shawl and put\nit over her head. It was the green _drap de dames_ shawl of which\nMarmeladov had spoken, “the family shawl.” Raskolnikov thought of that\nlooking at it, but he did not ask. He began to feel himself that he\nwas certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He was\nfrightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia\nmeant to go with him.\n\n“What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, stay! I’ll go\nalone,” he cried in cowardly vexation, and almost resentful, he moved\ntowards the door. “What’s the use of going in procession?” he muttered\ngoing out.\n\nSonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He had not even said\ngood-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A poignant and rebellious doubt\nsurged in his heart.\n\n“Was it right, was it right, all this?” he thought again as he went down\nthe stairs. “Couldn’t he stop and retract it all... and not go?”\n\nBut still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn’t ask\nhimself questions. As he turned into the street he remembered that he\nhad not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle of\nthe room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted\nat her, and he stopped short for a moment. At the same instant, another\nthought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strike\nhim then.\n\n“Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told her--on\nbusiness; on what business? I had no sort of business! To tell her I was\n_going_; but where was the need? Do I love her? No, no, I drove her away\njust now like a dog. Did I want her crosses? Oh, how low I’ve sunk! No,\nI wanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart\nached! I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, some\nfriendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, to dream of what\nI would do! I am a beggarly contemptible wretch, contemptible!”\n\nHe walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go. But\non reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it\nwent to the Hay Market.\n\nHe looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and\ncould not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away. “In\nanother week, another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this\nbridge, how shall I look at the canal then? I should like to remember\nthis!” slipped into his mind. “Look at this sign! How shall I read those\nletters then? It’s written here ‘Campany,’ that’s a thing to remember,\nthat letter _a_, and to look at it again in a month--how shall I look\nat it then? What shall I be feeling and thinking then?... How trivial\nit all must be, what I am fretting about now! Of course it must all be\ninteresting... in its way... (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) I am\nbecoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed? Foo! how\npeople shove! that fat man--a German he must be--who pushed against\nme, does he know whom he pushed? There’s a peasant woman with a baby,\nbegging. It’s curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might\ngive her something, for the incongruity of it. Here’s a five copeck\npiece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here... take it, my\ngood woman!”\n\n“God bless you,” the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice.\n\nHe went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very distasteful to be\nin a crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people. He would have\ngiven anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he\nwould not have remained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and\ndisorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down. There\nwas a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd,\nstared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short\njerky laugh. A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him,\nthough he still stared. He moved away at last, not remembering where he\nwas; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly\ncame over him, overwhelming him body and mind.\n\nHe suddenly recalled Sonia’s words, “Go to the cross-roads, bow down to\nthe people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and say\naloud to the whole world, ‘I am a murderer.’” He trembled, remembering\nthat. And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially\nof the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively\nclutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation. It came\nover him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and\nspreading fire through him. Everything in him softened at once and the\ntears started into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot....\n\nHe knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and\nkissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture. He got up and bowed\ndown a second time.\n\n“He’s boozed,” a youth near him observed.\n\nThere was a roar of laughter.\n\n“He’s going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his children\nand his country. He’s bowing down to all the world and kissing the great\ncity of St. Petersburg and its pavement,” added a workman who was a\nlittle drunk.\n\n“Quite a young man, too!” observed a third.\n\n“And a gentleman,” someone observed soberly.\n\n“There’s no knowing who’s a gentleman and who isn’t nowadays.”\n\nThese exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words, “I am\na murderer,” which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips,\ndied away. He bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking\nround, he turned down a street leading to the police office. He had a\nglimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt\nthat it must be so. The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he\nsaw, standing fifty paces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding\nfrom him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She had\nfollowed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at that moment felt\nand knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would follow\nhim to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him. It wrung his\nheart... but he was just reaching the fatal place.\n\nHe went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount to the third\nstorey. “I shall be some time going up,” he thought. He felt as though\nthe fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of time\nleft for consideration.\n\nAgain the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral\nstairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and\nthe same fumes and stench coming from them. Raskolnikov had not been\nhere since that day. His legs were numb and gave way under him, but\nstill they moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, to\ncollect himself, so as to enter _like a man_. “But why? what for?” he\nwondered, reflecting. “If I must drink the cup what difference does it\nmake? The more revolting the better.” He imagined for an instant the\nfigure of the “explosive lieutenant,” Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually\ngoing to him? Couldn’t he go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch?\nCouldn’t he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch’s lodgings?\nAt least then it would be done privately.... No, no! To the “explosive\nlieutenant”! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.\n\nTurning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office.\nThere were very few people in it this time--only a house porter and a\npeasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.\nRaskolnikov walked into the next room. “Perhaps I still need not speak,”\n passed through his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was\nsettling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner another clerk was\nseating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch.\n\n“No one in?” Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person at the bureau.\n\n“Whom do you want?”\n\n“A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but I scent the\nRussian... how does it go on in the fairy tale... I’ve forgotten! ‘At\nyour service!’” a familiar voice cried suddenly.\n\nRaskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him. He\nhad just come in from the third room. “It is the hand of fate,” thought\nRaskolnikov. “Why is he here?”\n\n“You’ve come to see us? What about?” cried Ilya Petrovitch. He\nwas obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle\nexhilarated. “If it’s on business you are rather early.[*] It’s only a\nchance that I am here... however I’ll do what I can. I must admit, I...\nwhat is it, what is it? Excuse me....”\n\n     [*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after\n     sunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the\n     police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for\n     coming too late.--TRANSLATOR.\n\n“Raskolnikov.”\n\n“Of course, Raskolnikov. You didn’t imagine I’d forgotten? Don’t think I\nam like that... Rodion Ro--Ro--Rodionovitch, that’s it, isn’t it?”\n\n“Rodion Romanovitch.”\n\n“Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch! I was just getting at it. I\nmade many inquiries about you. I assure you I’ve been genuinely grieved\nsince that... since I behaved like that... it was explained to me\nafterwards that you were a literary man... and a learned one too... and\nso to say the first steps... Mercy on us! What literary or scientific\nman does not begin by some originality of conduct! My wife and I have\nthe greatest respect for literature, in my wife it’s a genuine passion!\nLiterature and art! If only a man is a gentleman, all the rest can be\ngained by talents, learning, good sense, genius. As for a hat--well,\nwhat does a hat matter? I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but\nwhat’s under the hat, what the hat covers, I can’t buy that! I was even\nmeaning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you’d... But I\nam forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want really? I hear your\nfamily have come?”\n\n“Yes, my mother and sister.”\n\n“I’ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister--a highly\ncultivated and charming person. I confess I was sorry I got so hot with\nyou. There it is! But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting\nfit--that affair has been cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism!\nI understand your indignation. Perhaps you are changing your lodging on\naccount of your family’s arriving?”\n\n“No, I only looked in... I came to ask... I thought that I should find\nZametov here.”\n\n“Oh, yes! Of course, you’ve made friends, I heard. Well, no, Zametov is\nnot here. Yes, we’ve lost Zametov. He’s not been here since yesterday...\nhe quarrelled with everyone on leaving... in the rudest way. He is a\nfeather-headed youngster, that’s all; one might have expected something\nfrom him, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young men.\nHe wanted to go in for some examination, but it’s only to talk and\nboast about it, it will go no further than that. Of course it’s a very\ndifferent matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there, your friend. Your\ncareer is an intellectual one and you won’t be deterred by failure. For\nyou, one may say, all the attractions of life _nihil est_--you are an\nascetic, a monk, a hermit!... A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned\nresearch--that’s where your spirit soars! I am the same way myself....\nHave you read Livingstone’s Travels?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Oh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays, you know,\nand indeed it is not to be wondered at. What sort of days are they? I\nask you. But we thought... you are not a Nihilist of course? Answer me\nopenly, openly!”\n\n“N-no...”\n\n“Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself!\nOfficial duty is one thing but... you are thinking I meant to say\n_friendship_ is quite another? No, you’re wrong! It’s not friendship,\nbut the feeling of a man and a citizen, the feeling of humanity and of\nlove for the Almighty. I may be an official, but I am always bound\nto feel myself a man and a citizen.... You were asking about Zametov.\nZametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad\nreputation, over a glass of champagne... that’s all your Zametov is good\nfor! While I’m perhaps, so to speak, burning with devotion and lofty\nfeelings, and besides I have rank, consequence, a post! I am married and\nhave children, I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen, but who is\nhe, may I ask? I appeal to you as a man ennobled by education... Then\nthese midwives, too, have become extraordinarily numerous.”\n\nRaskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly. The words of Ilya\nPetrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for the most part a\nstream of empty sounds for him. But some of them he understood. He\nlooked at him inquiringly, not knowing how it would end.\n\n“I mean those crop-headed wenches,” the talkative Ilya Petrovitch\ncontinued. “Midwives is my name for them. I think it a very satisfactory\none, ha-ha! They go to the Academy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, am\nI to send for a young lady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!” Ilya\nPetrovitch laughed, quite pleased with his own wit. “It’s an immoderate\nzeal for education, but once you’re educated, that’s enough. Why abuse\nit? Why insult honourable people, as that scoundrel Zametov does? Why\ndid he insult me, I ask you? Look at these suicides, too, how common\nthey are, you can’t fancy! People spend their last halfpenny and kill\nthemselves, boys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heard\nabout a gentleman who had just come to town. Nil Pavlitch, I say, what\nwas the name of that gentleman who shot himself?”\n\n“Svidrigaïlov,” someone answered from the other room with drowsy\nlistlessness.\n\nRaskolnikov started.\n\n“Svidrigaïlov! Svidrigaïlov has shot himself!” he cried.\n\n“What, do you know Svidrigaïlov?”\n\n“Yes... I knew him.... He hadn’t been here long.”\n\n“Yes, that’s so. He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless habits and\nall of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shocking way.... He left\nin his notebook a few words: that he dies in full possession of his\nfaculties and that no one is to blame for his death. He had money, they\nsay. How did you come to know him?”\n\n“I... was acquainted... my sister was governess in his family.”\n\n“Bah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something about him. You had\nno suspicion?”\n\n“I saw him yesterday... he... was drinking wine; I knew nothing.”\n\nRaskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling\nhim.\n\n“You’ve turned pale again. It’s so stuffy here...”\n\n“Yes, I must go,” muttered Raskolnikov. “Excuse my troubling you....”\n\n“Oh, not at all, as often as you like. It’s a pleasure to see you and I\nam glad to say so.”\n\nIlya Petrovitch held out his hand.\n\n“I only wanted... I came to see Zametov.”\n\n“I understand, I understand, and it’s a pleasure to see you.”\n\n“I... am very glad... good-bye,” Raskolnikov smiled.\n\nHe went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know\nwhat he was doing. He began going down the stairs, supporting himself\nwith his right hand against the wall. He fancied that a porter pushed\npast him on his way upstairs to the police office, that a dog in\nthe lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a\nrolling-pin at it and shouted. He went down and out into the yard.\nThere, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale and horror-stricken.\nShe looked wildly at him. He stood still before her. There was a look of\npoignant agony, of despair, in her face. She clasped her hands. His lips\nworked in an ugly, meaningless smile. He stood still a minute, grinned\nand went back to the police office.\n\nIlya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers. Before\nhim stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs.\n\n“Hulloa! Back again! have you left something behind? What’s the matter?”\n\nRaskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came slowly nearer.\nHe walked right to the table, leaned his hand on it, tried to say\nsomething, but could not; only incoherent sounds were audible.\n\n“You are feeling ill, a chair! Here, sit down! Some water!”\n\nRaskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept his eyes fixed on the\nface of Ilya Petrovitch, which expressed unpleasant surprise. Both\nlooked at one another for a minute and waited. Water was brought.\n\n“It was I...” began Raskolnikov.\n\n“Drink some water.”\n\nRaskolnikov refused the water with his hand, and softly and brokenly,\nbut distinctly said:\n\n“_It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with\nan axe and robbed them._”\n\nIlya Petrovitch opened his mouth. People ran up on all sides.\n\nRaskolnikov repeated his statement.\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nI\n\nSiberia. On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town, one of\nthe administrative centres of Russia; in the town there is a fortress,\nin the fortress there is a prison. In the prison the second-class\nconvict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months. Almost a\nyear and a half has passed since his crime.\n\nThere had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adhered\nexactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement. He did not confuse nor\nmisrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit\nthe smallest detail. He explained every incident of the murder, the\nsecret of _the pledge_ (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which\nwas found in the murdered woman’s hand. He described minutely how he\nhad taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and its\ncontents; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta’s murder; described how\nKoch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they had said\nto one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay\nand Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards\ngone home. He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the\nVoznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found.\nThe whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the\njudges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he\nhad hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making\nuse of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the\ntrinkets were like, or even how many there were. The fact that he had\nnever opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed\nincredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and\nseventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being so long under the stone,\nsome of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the\ndamp. They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man\nshould tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made\na truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some of the lawyers\nmore versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really\nnot looked into the purse, and so didn’t know what was in it when he\nhid it under the stone. But they immediately drew the deduction that\nthe crime could only have been committed through temporary mental\nderangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of\ngain. This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary\ninsanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases. Moreover\nRaskolnikov’s hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by\nDr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant.\nAll this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not\nquite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another\nelement in the case.\n\nTo the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the\ncriminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. To the decisive question\nas to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he\nanswered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was\nhis miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to\nprovide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand\nroubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been led to the murder\nthrough his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by\nprivation and failure. To the question what led him to confess, he\nanswered that it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was almost\ncoarse....\n\nThe sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,\nperhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself,\nbut had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange\nand peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.\nThere could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition\nof the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what he\nhad stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his\nabnormal mental condition at the time of the crime. Incidentally the\nmurder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man\ncommits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Finally, the\nconfession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by\nthe false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism,\nand when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no\nsuspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this did\nmuch to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, too, in the prisoner’s\nfavour came out quite unexpectedly. Razumihin somehow discovered and\nproved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor\nconsumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting\nhim for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit\nold father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year,\nRaskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral\nwhen he died. Raskolnikov’s landlady bore witness, too, that when they\nhad lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two\nlittle children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so. This was\ninvestigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses. These facts\nmade an impression in his favour.\n\nAnd in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuating\ncircumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a\nterm of eight years only.\n\nAt the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov’s mother fell ill. Dounia\nand Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the\ntrial. Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so\nas to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time\nto see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s\nillness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial\nderangement of her intellect.\n\nWhen Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, she\nhad found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium. That evening\nRazumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother’s\nquestions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her\nmother’s benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia\non a business commission, which would bring him in the end money and\nreputation.\n\nBut they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never\nasked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter. On the\ncontrary, she had her own version of her son’s sudden departure; she\ntold them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting\nthat she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodya\nhad many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be\nin hiding. As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be\nbrilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed. She assured\nRazumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his\narticle and brilliant literary talent proved it. This article she was\ncontinually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed\nwith her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was\nobviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken\nher suspicions.\n\nThey began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s strange\nsilence on certain subjects. She did not, for instance, complain of\ngetting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived\non the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of\ngreat uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother\nsuspected that there was something terrible in her son’s fate and was\nafraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful. In any\ncase, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of\nher faculties.\n\nIt happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave\nsuch a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her\nwithout mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and\nsuspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood\nlasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive\nher and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely\nsilent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that\nthe poor mother suspected something terrible. Dounia remembered her\nbrother’s telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her\nsleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and before the\nfatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that?\nSometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be\nsucceeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would\nbegin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his\nfuture.... Her fancies were sometimes very strange. They humoured her,\npretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending),\nbut she still went on talking.\n\nFive months after Raskolnikov’s confession, he was sentenced. Razumihin\nand Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible. At last\nthe moment of separation came. Dounia swore to her brother that the\nseparation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same. Razumihin, in\nhis youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least\nof a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving\nup a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a country rich in every\nnatural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital. There\nthey would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would\nbegin a new life. They all wept at parting.\n\nRaskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. He asked a great\ndeal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her. He worried\nso much about her that it alarmed Dounia. When he heard about his\nmother’s illness he became very gloomy. With Sonia he was particularly\nreserved all the time. With the help of the money left to her by\nSvidrigaïlov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the\nparty of convicts in which he was despatched to Siberia. Not a word\npassed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew it\nwould be so. At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his\nsister’s and Razumihin’s fervent anticipations of their happy future\ntogether when he should come out of prison. He predicted that their\nmother’s illness would soon have a fatal ending. Sonia and he at last\nset off.\n\nTwo months later Dounia was married to Razumihin. It was a quiet and\nsorrowful wedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were invited however.\nDuring all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination.\nDounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she\ncould not but believe in him. He displayed a rare strength of will.\nAmong other things he began attending university lectures again in order\nto take his degree. They were continually making plans for the future;\nboth counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least. Till\nthen they rested their hopes on Sonia.\n\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounia’s\nmarriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more\nmelancholy and anxious. To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how\nRaskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father\nand how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two\nlittle children from a fire. These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna’s disordered imagination almost to ecstasy. She was\ncontinually talking about them, even entering into conversation with\nstrangers in the street, though Dounia always accompanied her. In public\nconveyances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she would\nbegin the discourse about her son, his article, how he had helped the\nstudent, how he had been burnt at the fire, and so on! Dounia did\nnot know how to restrain her. Apart from the danger of her morbid\nexcitement, there was the risk of someone’s recalling Raskolnikov’s name\nand speaking of the recent trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the\naddress of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted\non going to see her.\n\nAt last her restlessness reached an extreme point. She would sometimes\nbegin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious. One\nmorning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home,\nthat she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must\nexpect him back in nine months. She began to prepare for his coming,\nbegan to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and\nput up new hangings and so on. Dounia was anxious, but said nothing and\nhelped her to arrange the room. After a fatiguing day spent in continual\nfancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\ntaken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious.\nIt was brain fever. She died within a fortnight. In her delirium she\ndropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her\nson’s terrible fate than they had supposed.\n\nFor a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother’s death, though\na regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached\nSiberia. It was carried on by means of Sonia, who wrote every month\nto the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity. At\nfirst they found Sonia’s letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on\nthey came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for\nfrom these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate\nbrother’s life. Sonia’s letters were full of the most matter-of-fact\ndetail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov’s\nsurroundings as a convict. There was no word of her own hopes, no\nconjecture as to the future, no description of her feelings. Instead of\nany attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, she gave the\nsimple facts--that is, his own words, an exact account of his health,\nwhat he asked for at their interviews, what commission he gave her\nand so on. All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness. The\npicture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness\nand precision. There could be no mistake, because nothing was given but\nfacts.\n\nBut Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news,\nespecially at first. Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not\nready to talk, that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave\nhim from their letters, that he sometimes asked after his mother and\nthat when, seeing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last\nof her death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly\naffected by it, not externally at any rate. She told them that, although\nhe seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself off\nfrom everyone--he took a very direct and simple view of his new life;\nthat he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time,\nhad no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely\nseemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, so unlike anything he\nhad known before. She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his\nwork without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent\nabout food, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad that\nat last he had been glad to accept some money from her, Sonia, to have\nhis own tea every day. He begged her not to trouble about anything else,\ndeclaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him. Sonia wrote\nfurther that in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she\nhad not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were\ncrowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a\nrug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement. But that\nhe lived so poorly and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply\nfrom inattention and indifference.\n\nSonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits,\nhad almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and\nrude to her. But that in the end these visits had become a habit and\nalmost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed when\nshe was ill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see him\non holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, to which he was\nbrought for a few minutes to see her. On working days she would go to\nsee him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or at the\nsheds on the banks of the Irtish.\n\nAbout herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some\nacquaintances in the town, that she did sewing, and, as there\nwas scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she was looked upon as an\nindispensable person in many houses. But she did not mention that the\nauthorities were, through her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his task\nwas lightened and so on.\n\nAt last the news came (Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and\nuneasiness in the preceding letters) that he held aloof from everyone,\nthat his fellow prisoners did not like him, that he kept silent for days\nat a time and was becoming very pale. In the last letter Sonia wrote\nthat he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of\nthe hospital.\n\n\n\nII\n\nHe was ill a long time. But it was not the horrors of prison life, not\nthe hard labour, the bad food, the shaven head, or the patched clothes\nthat crushed him. What did he care for all those trials and hardships!\nhe was even glad of the hard work. Physically exhausted, he could at\nleast reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep. And what was the food to\nhim--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it? In the past as a\nstudent he had often not had even that. His clothes were warm and suited\nto his manner of life. He did not even feel the fetters. Was he ashamed\nof his shaven head and parti-coloured coat? Before whom? Before Sonia?\nSonia was afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her? And yet he\nwas ashamed even before Sonia, whom he tortured because of it with\nhis contemptuous rough manner. But it was not his shaven head and his\nfetters he was ashamed of: his pride had been stung to the quick. It was\nwounded pride that made him ill. Oh, how happy he would have been if he\ncould have blamed himself! He could have borne anything then, even\nshame and disgrace. But he judged himself severely, and his exasperated\nconscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, except\na simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone. He was ashamed just\nbecause he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief\nthrough some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit to\n“the idiocy” of a sentence, if he were anyhow to be at peace.\n\nVague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the future a\ncontinual sacrifice leading to nothing--that was all that lay before\nhim. And what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he\nwould only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life! What had he to\nlive for? What had he to look forward to? Why should he strive? To live\nin order to exist? Why, he had been ready a thousand times before to\ngive up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for a fancy.\nMere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted\nmore. Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he\nhad thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others.\n\nAnd if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance that\nwould have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep, that repentance, the\nawful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning! Oh, he would\nhave been glad of it! Tears and agonies would at least have been life.\nBut he did not repent of his crime.\n\nAt least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity, as he\nhad raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison.\nBut now in prison, _in freedom_, he thought over and criticised all his\nactions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque\nas they had seemed at the fatal time.\n\n“In what way,” he asked himself, “was my theory stupider than others\nthat have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world? One has\nonly to look at the thing quite independently, broadly, and uninfluenced\nby commonplace ideas, and my idea will by no means seem so... strange.\nOh, sceptics and halfpenny philosophers, why do you halt half-way!\n\n“Why does my action strike them as so horrible?” he said to himself. “Is\nit because it was a crime? What is meant by crime? My conscience is at\nrest. Of course, it was a legal crime, of course, the letter of the law\nwas broken and blood was shed. Well, punish me for the letter of the\nlaw... and that’s enough. Of course, in that case many of the\nbenefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of\ninheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps. But\nthose men succeeded and so _they were right_, and I didn’t, and so I\nhad no right to have taken that step.”\n\nIt was only in that that he recognised his criminality, only in the fact\nthat he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it.\n\nHe suffered too from the question: why had he not killed himself? Why\nhad he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess? Was the\ndesire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it? Had not\nSvidrigaïlov overcome it, although he was afraid of death?\n\nIn misery he asked himself this question, and could not understand that,\nat the very time he had been standing looking into the river, he had\nperhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and\nhis convictions. He didn’t understand that that consciousness might be\nthe promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future\nresurrection.\n\nHe preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he\ncould not step over, again through weakness and meanness. He looked at\nhis fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and\nprized it. It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in\nprison than in freedom. What terrible agonies and privations some of\nthem, the tramps for instance, had endured! Could they care so much for\na ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold spring hidden away\nin some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, and\nlonged to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the\ngreen grass round it and the bird singing in the bush? As he went on he\nsaw still more inexplicable examples.\n\nIn prison, of course, there was a great deal he did not see and did not\nwant to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes. It was loathsome\nand unbearable for him to look. But in the end there was much that\nsurprised him and he began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much\nthat he had not suspected before. What surprised him most of all was\nthe terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest. They\nseemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they at\nhim with distrust and hostility. He felt and knew the reasons of his\nisolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons\nwere so deep and strong. There were some Polish exiles, political\nprisoners, among them. They simply looked down upon all the rest as\nignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that.\nHe saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the\nPoles. There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous, a former\nofficer and two seminarists. Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.\nHe was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him at\nlast--why, he could not tell. Men who had been far more guilty despised\nand laughed at his crime.\n\n“You’re a gentleman,” they used to say. “You shouldn’t hack about with\nan axe; that’s not a gentleman’s work.”\n\nThe second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacrament with his\ngang. He went to church and prayed with the others. A quarrel broke out\none day, he did not know how. All fell on him at once in a fury.\n\n“You’re an infidel! You don’t believe in God,” they shouted. “You ought\nto be killed.”\n\nHe had never talked to them about God nor his belief, but they wanted to\nkill him as an infidel. He said nothing. One of the prisoners rushed at\nhim in a perfect frenzy. Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently;\nhis eyebrows did not quiver, his face did not flinch. The guard\nsucceeded in intervening between him and his assailant, or there would\nhave been bloodshed.\n\nThere was another question he could not decide: why were they all so\nfond of Sonia? She did not try to win their favour; she rarely met\nthem, sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment. And yet\neverybody knew her, they knew that she had come out to follow _him_,\nknew how and where she lived. She never gave them money, did them no\nparticular services. Only once at Christmas she sent them all presents\nof pies and rolls. But by degrees closer relations sprang up between\nthem and Sonia. She would write and post letters for them to their\nrelations. Relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at their\ninstructions, left with Sonia presents and money for them. Their wives\nand sweethearts knew her and used to visit her. And when she visited\nRaskolnikov at work, or met a party of the prisoners on the road, they\nall took off their hats to her. “Little mother Sofya Semyonovna, you\nare our dear, good little mother,” coarse branded criminals said to that\nfrail little creature. She would smile and bow to them and everyone was\ndelighted when she smiled. They even admired her gait and turned round\nto watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little, and, in\nfact, did not know what to admire her most for. They even came to her\nfor help in their illnesses.\n\nHe was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter. When\nhe was better, he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish\nand delirious. He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a\nterrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of\nAsia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sorts\nof microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were\nendowed with intelligence and will. Men attacked by them became at once\nmad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectual\nand so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never\nhad they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their\nmoral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples\nwent mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understand\none another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched\nlooking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung\nhis hands. They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to\nconsider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom\nto justify. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. They\ngathered together in armies against one another, but even on the march\nthe armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken\nand the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting\nand devouring each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in\nthe towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was\nsummoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned,\nbecause everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they\ncould not agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, agreed\non something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something\nquite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another,\nfought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. All\nmen and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread and\nmoved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the whole\nworld. They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and\na new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these\nmen, no one had heard their words and their voices.\n\nRaskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so\nmiserably, the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long.\nThe second week after Easter had come. There were warm bright spring\ndays; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel\npaced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during\nhis illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it was\ndifficult. But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especially\nin the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the\nwindows of the ward.\n\nOne evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep. On\nwaking up he chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the\ndistance at the hospital gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone.\nSomething stabbed him to the heart at that minute. He shuddered and\nmoved away from the window. Next day Sonia did not come, nor the day\nafter; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily. At last he was\ndischarged. On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that\nSofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.\n\nHe was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that\nher illness was not dangerous. Hearing that he was anxious about her,\nSonia sent him a pencilled note, telling him that she was much better,\nthat she had a slight cold and that she would soon, very soon come and\nsee him at his work. His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.\n\nAgain it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, at six o’clock, he\nwent off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster\nand where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed. There were only\nthree of them sent. One of the convicts went with the guard to the\nfortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and\nlaying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river\nbank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the\nwide deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape opened before\nhim, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank.\nIn the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black\nspecks, the nomads’ tents. There there was freedom, there other men were\nliving, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand\nstill, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed.\nRaskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, into\ncontemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited\nand troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up\nnoiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the\nmorning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and the\ngreen shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and\npaler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand\nwith her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand\nto him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would\nrepel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always\nseemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout\nher visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply\ngrieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance\nat her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They were\nalone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.\n\nHow it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to\nseize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round\nher knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she\nturned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same\nmoment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her\neyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and\nthat at last the moment had come....\n\nThey wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They\nwere both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the\ndawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life. They were\nrenewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the\nheart of the other.\n\nThey resolved to wait and be patient. They had another seven years to\nwait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before\nthem! But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his\nbeing, while she--she only lived in his life.\n\nOn the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked,\nRaskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her. He had even fancied\nthat day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him\ndifferently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered\nhim in a friendly way. He remembered that now, and thought it was bound\nto be so. Wasn’t everything now bound to be changed?\n\nHe thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented her\nand wounded her heart. He remembered her pale and thin little face.\nBut these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what\ninfinite love he would now repay all her sufferings. And what were all,\n_all_ the agonies of the past! Everything, even his crime, his sentence\nand imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an\nexternal, strange fact with which he had no concern. But he could not\nthink for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have\nanalysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped\ninto the place of theory and something quite different would work itself\nout in his mind.\n\nUnder his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically.\nThe book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read the\nraising of Lazarus to him. At first he was afraid that she would worry\nhim about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him with\nbooks. But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject\nand had not even offered him the Testament. He had asked her for it\nhimself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without\na word. Till now he had not opened it.\n\nHe did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: “Can\nher convictions not be mine now? Her feelings, her aspirations at\nleast....”\n\nShe too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was taken\nill again. But she was so happy--and so unexpectedly happy--that she was\nalmost frightened of her happiness. Seven years, _only_ seven years! At\nthe beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready\nto look on those seven years as though they were seven days. He did not\nknow that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would\nhave to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great\nsuffering.\n\nBut that is the beginning of a new story--the story of the gradual\nrenewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing\nfrom one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.\nThat might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is\nended.\n\n`\n);","export class UI {\n  \n  // TAKES BOOK OBJECT, REPLACES CARRIAGE RETURNS AND LINE FEEDS WITH HTML LINE BREAKS, DISPLAYS BOOK
